Abstract 
Background: Both propofol and sevoflurane, commonly used anesthetics, may cause brain oxygen metabolism abnormalities 
potentially linked to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), though their precise relationship with POCD requires further study.
Objective: To systematically evaluate sevoflurane inhalation versus propofol intravenous anesthesia effects on postoperative 
cognitive function in cancer patients.
Methods: We searched PubMed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and Chinese Biomedical Literature 
databases (from January 10, 2023) using keywords including Anaesthesia, Anesthetic Agents, Neoplasm, Cancer, Cognition, and 
Cognitive Function. Only human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies were included; no language 
restrictions applied.
Results: 41 studies met criteria (40 RCTs, 1 cohort), involving 4342 patients (2171 sevoflurane, 2171 propofol). Meta-analysis: 
Overall POCD incidence showed no significant difference between groups. Subgroup analysis revealed significantly increased 
POCD with sevoflurane at unspecified postoperative times. No significant differences were found at 6 hours, 7 days, or 3 months. 
Significantly decreased POCD with sevoflurane was observed at 1 and 3 days postoperatively. Preoperative Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) scores showed no significant difference. Overall postoperative MMSE scores also showed no significant 
difference. However, MMSE scores were significantly lower in the sevoflurane group at 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours postoperatively. No 
significant differences were found at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 days, or 1 month.
Conclusion subsections: Sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia may exert differing short-term, but not long-term, negative 
impacts on cognitive function in cancer patients. Overall, no significant difference exists in their effects on postoperative cognitive 
function.

1. Introduction
As the main treatment of solid malignant tumor, surgery 
is frequently adopted in clinic. Meanwhile, anesthesia, the 
important part of surgery, not only determines whether the 
operation can be performed smoothly, but also plays a crit­
ical part in the therapeutic effect. Recently, clinical studies 
find that patients may suffer from cognitive impairment

after anesthesia, and postoperative cognitive dysfunction 
(POCD) may occur after anesthesia to a certain extent.[1,2] 
As a common complication after anesthesia, cognitive dys­
function often manifests as memory impairment, cognitive 
decline, anxiety, personality change, and even dementia. The 
POCD symptoms may last for several weeks or even months 
postoperatively, which leads to a longer hospital stay, lower 
patient life quality, heavier economic burdens on patients, 
and greater demand for social support, and is also related to 
higher morbidity and mortality rates.[3] At present, regardless 
of the largely unclear and multifactorial pathogenic mecha­
nism and etiology of POCD, anesthesia accounts for a key 
factors affecting the POCD occurrence, while propofol and 
sevoflurane, the commonly used anesthetics in clinic, can 
cause abnormal cerebral oxygen metabolism, which in turn 
leads to POCD. Recent studies by Modolo and Fang showed 
that inflammatory response induced by surgery is significantly 
involved in POCD pathogenesis, given that the preoperative 
administration of corticosteroids ameliorates inflammatory 
response prompted by surgery and thereby, reduced the sever­
ity and incidence of POCD.[4,5]
Sevoflurane is an inhalation anesthetic used to maintain 
anesthesia, which has been recognized as the risk factor related 
to cognitive impairment during brain aging, nonetheless, its 
application remains a source of controversy.[6,7] As shown in 
certain experimental studies,[8,9] sevoflurane inhalation can 
cause pathological alterations within the hippocampus of rats 
and lead to apoptosis, thus leading to the decline of neurocog­
nitive function. Sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia can result in 
emotional abnormality and cognitive dysfunction in elderly 
rats undergoing abdominal surgery.[10] Another report[11] 
points out that sevoflurane does not damage the learning and 
memory functions of adult rats. Moreover, according to 1 
prospective study,[4] sevoflurane general anesthesia is related 
to cognitive dysfunction among elderly surgical patients suf­
fering from mild cognitive impairment. Nonetheless, the early 
POCD incidence following general anesthesia was not signifi­
cantly different between sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia. 
In 1 RCT, compared with propofol anesthesia, sevoflurane 
anesthesia has a lower POCD incidence among elderly surgical 
patients receiving propofol anesthesia 1 and 3 days postop­
eratively, nevertheless, the RCT is limited since postoperative 
delirium and POCD are not defined.[12] However, a RCT finds 
that the POCD incidence is not significantly different between 
sevoflurane anesthesia and propofol anesthesia 3 months after 
operation.[13]

To sum up, the above data show that more investigations 
are needed to explore the relationship between sevoflurane ver­
sus propofol anesthesia and postoperative cognitive function. 
Therefore, it is of positive significance to explore the efficacy of 
propofol versus sevoflurane in postoperative cognitive function 
of cancer patients. To this end, the present work conducted a 
meta-analysis to offer some guiding significance for clinical practice.
2. Data and methods
2.1. Inclusion criteria
Research type: clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs). 
Objects of study: cancer patients, with no restriction of cancer 
type. Interventions: sevoflurane/ether was used in observation 
group, whereas propofol was used in control group. Outcome 
measures: Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) score and 
the POCD incidence.
2.2. Exclusion criteria
Studies satisfying at least one of criteria below were elimi­
nated: studies with unclear research objects; unable to extract 
data; studies not including research indicators; documents 
with duplicate data; duplicate publications; summaries and 
case reports; non-RCTs; documents with inconsistent interven­
tion measures; and pet-name ruby basic experimental research.
2.3. Literature retrieval
RCTs or prospective cohort studies comparing the efficacy of 
sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia versus propofol intrave­
nous anesthesia in cancer patients were retrieved in PubMed, 
EMbase, the Cochrane Library, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang Medical 
Network, VIP, and Chinese Biomedical Literature network data­
base to obtain relevant articles up to January 10, 2023 using the 
keywords of Anaesthesia, Anesthetic Agents, Anesthetic Drugs, 
Anesthetic, Neoplasm, Tumor, Neoplasia, Cancer, Malignant 
Neoplasm, Malignancy, Malignancies, Malignant Neoplasms, 
Malignant tumor, Cognition, and Cognitive Function. The 
search was not restricted by language and Human and animal 
studies are not included.
2.4. Data extraction
All the retrieved documents were screened by 2 indepen­
dent researchers in the research group in strict accordance 
Figure 2.  Incidence of POCD. POCD = postoperative cognitive dysfunction.

with our predetermined eligibility criteria. Any disagree­
ment between them was solved through discussion. The 
basic information extracted mainly included author and 
publication year, gender, age, sample size, intervention mea­
sures, and treatment duration. Meanwhile, the main out­
come measure data extracted were MMSE score and POCD 
incidence.
2.5. Evaluation of methodological quality in the 
literature
The Jadad quality scoring method was utilized for evaluat­
ing the RCT methodological quality, and the evaluation items 
included randomization, allocation concealment, blinding 
method, and withdrawals and dropouts.[14] Studies of 4 to 7 
points had high quality, while those of 1 to 3 points had low 
quality.
2.6. Statistical analysis
Stata17.0 was employed for statistical analysis. Continuous data 
were expressed by mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence 
interval (CI), while dichotomous data were analyzed through 
odds ratio (OR) and 95%CI.
3. Results
3.1. Study retrieval and screening
This work identified altogether 1329 documents from pri­
mary literature retrieval, and 779 of them were retained after 
duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were read, as a 
result, 67 documents were chosen in line with eligibility criteria. 
Thereafter, full-texts were carefully read, and non-RCTs were 
eliminated. Finally, 41 studies were included.[15–55] Figure 1 dis­
plays the study selection process.

3.2. Baseline study features and quality assessment
Table 1 displays baseline study features. Besides, quality of those 
enrolled articles was evaluated, which suggested that 5 RCTs had 
the Jadad score of 3 points, and the others had the score of ≥ 4 
points, demonstrating high quality of our enrolled studies.
3.3. Meta-analysis results
3.3.1. Incidence of POCD.  Due to the inconsistent time points 
of detecting the incidence of POCD after anesthesia among 
various studies, including postoperatively (unspecified time), 
6 hours, 1, 3, 7 days, and 3 months postoperatively, subgroup

analysis was carried out according to the different time points 
of POCD detection. In the subgroup after operation (unspecified 
time), 2 studies[48,51] reported the incidence of POCD, and the 
heterogeneity test (I2 = 0.0% and P > .10) showed the absence 
of obvious heterogeneity across those enrolled articles, 
therefore, a fixed-effect model was adopted for calculating 
combined effect. As a result, the POCD incidence of sevoflurane 
group increased relative to control group, with a significant 
difference [RR = 2]. In the subgroup 6 hours after operation, 2 
studies[25,43] mentioned the POCD incidence, and heterogeneity 
test (I2 = 0.0% and P > .10) showed no obvious heterogeneity 
across those enrolled articles; similarly, a fixed-effect model 
was applied in analyzing combined effect, which demonstrated 
that the POCD incidence was not significantly different 
between 2 groups [RR = 0.87, 95% CI]. In the subgroup 1 day 
postoperatively, 3 studies[25,32,43] reported the incidence of POCD, 
and the heterogeneity test (I2 = 46.5% and P > .10) showed little 
heterogeneity across those enrolled articles, so the fixed-effect 
model was used for analyzing combined effect. It was found that 
the POCD incidence of sevoflurane group decreased relative to 
control group, with a significant difference [RR = 0.50]. Three 
studies[25,32,43] mentioned the POCD incidence in the subgroup 
3 days postoperatively, and the heterogeneity test (I2 = 0.0% 
and P > .10) showed the absence of heterogeneity across those 
enrolled articles, and the fixed-effect model was adopted to 
examine combined effect. As discovered, the POCD incidence 
of sevoflurane group decreased relative to control group, with 
a significant difference [RR = 0.13]. Seven days after operation, 
8 studies[15,25,32,43,44,46,49,55] mentioned the POCD incidence, 
and heterogeneity test (I2 = 36.0% and P > .10) revealed little 
heterogeneity across those enrolled articles, so combined effect 
was analyzed by using the fixed-effect model. Our findings 
revealed no significant difference between 2 groups of patients. 
In the subgroup 3 months after operation, 2 studies[44,47] reported 
the incidence of POCD, and the heterogeneity test (I2 = 0.0% 
and P > .10) demonstrated no obvious heterogeneity across 
those enrolled articles, so the fixed-effect model was utilized 
to analyze combined effect. We discovered that the POCD 
incidence was not significantly different between 2 groups 
(RR = 1.30, 95% CI[0.74, 2.28], P > .05) (Fig. 2).
3.3.2. MMSE scores.  Because of the different time points 
of detecting MMSE scores after anesthesia in various studies, 
including preoperatively (unspecific time), 1, 3, 6, 12 hours, 1, 2, 
3, 5, 7 days and 3 months postoperatively, analyses were made 
according to the different detection time points of detecting 
MMSE scores.
3.3.2.1. Meta-analysis of MMSE scores in preoperative 
patients.  Thirty-seven studies reported the preoperative MMSE 
scores of patients, including 1978 patients of sevoflurane group 
whereas 1977 of propofol group. A large heterogeneity was 
detected by heterogeneity test (I2 = 83.0% and P < .10) across 
diverse enrolled articles, therefore, combined effect was analyzed 
by using the random-effects model. As a result, MMSE scores 
were not significantly different between 2 groups (standardized

mean difference [SMD] = −0.11, 95% CI: [−0.26, 0.05], P > .05). 
Moreover, given the high heterogeneity across enrolled articles, 
sensitivity analysis was carried out by eliminating 1 article each 
time. It was found that the study conducted by Yi Du[50] was 
the main source leading to the increase in heterogeneity. After 
eliminating this study, the results still showed no significant 
difference in preoperative MMSE scores between 2 groups, so 
these results were relatively stable and reliable (Fig. 3).
3.3.2.2. Meta-analysis of MMSE scores of patients 1 hour after 
operation.  Eight articles reported the MMSE scores of patients 
1 hour postoperatively, including 529 cases of sevoflurane 
group while 529 of propofol group. A large heterogeneity 
was detected upon heterogeneity test (I2 = 98.0% and P < .10) 
across those enrolled articles, so combined effect was quantified 
by using the random-effects model. According to our findings, 
MMSE score was not significantly different between 2 groups 
1 hour postoperatively (SMD = −0.82, 95% CI: [−1.81, 0.16], 
P > .05). Considering the high degree of heterogeneity across 
those enrolled articles, we conducted sensitivity analysis 
through eliminating 1 article each time, and found that the 
study performed by Lu[34] accounted for the major source 
of heterogeneity. When this study was excluded, the results 
obtained still suggested that MMSE score in sevoflurane group 
decreased relative to propofol group 1 hour postoperatively, 
with a significant difference. Therefore, the result was unstable 
and not reliable, which should be interpreted with caution 
(Fig. 4).
3.3.2.3. Meta-analysis of MMSE scores of patients 3 hours 
after operation.  Five articles mentioned the MMSE scores 
of patients 3 hours postoperatively, including 216 cases 
from sevoflurane group while 212 from propofol group. As 
suggested by heterogeneity test (I2 = 53.1% and P < .10), a great 
heterogeneity was detected across those enrolled articles, and 
combined effect was analyzed by the random-effects model. It 
was discovered that, MMSE score of sevoflurane group decreased 
relative to propofol group 3 hours postoperatively, with a 
significant difference (SMD = −1.79, 95% CI: [−2.13, −1.46]). 
Because of the large heterogeneity detected across those enrolled 
articles, sensitivity analysis was performed through eliminating 
1 article each time, but the major source of heterogeneity was 
not detected. After excluding any literature, the results obtained 
still demonstrated the decreased MMSE score in sevoflurane 
group relative to propofol group 3 hours after operation, so the 
results were relatively stable and reliable (Fig. 5).
3.3.2.4. Meta-analysis of MMSE scores of patients 6 hours 
after operation.  There were 21 articles reporting MMSE 
scores of patients 6 hours postoperatively, including 1005 cases 
from sevoflurane group while 1001 from propofol group. As 
suggested by heterogeneity test (I2 = 98.1% and P < .10), a 
large heterogeneity was detected across those enrolled articles, 
so combined effect was analyzed using the random-effects 
model. According to our findings, MMSE scores were not 
significantly different between 2 groups 6 hours postoperatively 
(SMD = −0.20, 95% CI: [−0.94, 0.54], P > .05). Because of the 
large heterogeneity across those enrolled articles, sensitivity 
analysis was conducted through excluding 1 study each 
time, but the major source of heterogeneity was not detected. 
After excluding any study, MMSE score in sevoflurane group 
always decreased compared with propofol group 6 hours after 
operation, so the results were relatively stable and reliable 
(Fig. 6).
3.3.2.5. Meta-analysis of MMSE scores in patients 12 hours 
postoperatively.  Nine articles mentioned the MMSE scores 
in patients 12 hours postoperatively, including 1978 cases 
from sevoflurane group while 1977 from propofol group. 
A large heterogeneity was detected upon heterogeneity test 
(I2 = 97.4% and P < .10) across those enrolled articles, so the 
combined effect was analyzed using the random-effects model.

It was found that MMSE scores were not significantly different 
between 2 groups 12 hours postoperatively (SMD = −0.38, 
95% CI: [−1.33, 0.57], P > .05). Because of the high degree 
of heterogeneity across our enrolled articles, we conducted 
sensitivity analysis through excluding 1 article each time and 
discovered that the study carried out by Lu[34] accounted for the 
major source of heterogeneity. When this article was excluded, 
our findings indicated the decreased MMSE score in sevoflurane 
group relative to propofol group 12 hours after operation, with 
a significant difference. Therefore, our result was unstable and 
not reliable, which required careful interpretation (Fig. 7).
3.3.2.6. Meta-analysis of MMSE scores in patients 1 day 
after operation.  There were 31 articles mentioning the MMSE 
scores in patients 1 day postoperatively, including 1066 cases 
of sevoflurane group while 1064 of propofol group. A large 
heterogeneity was detected across our enrolled articles through 
heterogeneity test (I2 = 96.9% and P < .10), and combined effect 
was analyzed using the random-effects model. Our findings 
revealed that MMSE scores were not significantly different 
between 2 groups 1 day postoperatively (SMD = −0.28, 95% 
CI: [−0.73, 0.16], P > .05). Because of the large heterogeneity 
across our chosen articles, sensitivity analysis was conducted 
through eliminating 1 article each time, but the main source of 
heterogeneity was not detected. After excluding any study, the 
results still exhibited no significant difference in MMSE scores 
between 2 groups 1 day postoperatively, so these results were 
relatively stable and reliable (Fig. 8).
3.3.2.7. Meta-analysis of MMSE scores in patients 2 days 
after operation.  There were 5 studies reporting MMSE 
scores in patients 2 days postoperatively, including 210 
cases from sevoflurane group whereas 210 from propofol 
group. Upon heterogeneity test (I2 = 96.2% and P < .10), a 
large heterogeneity was detected across the selected articles, 
so the combined effect was analyzed by the random-effects 
model. As a result, MMSE scores were not significantly 
different between 2 groups 2 days postoperatively 
(SMD = −0.20, 95% CI: [−0.88, 1.28], P > .05). Because of 
the large heterogeneity detected across our chosen articles, 
we conducted sensitivity analysis through eliminating 
1 article each time, but failed to find the main source of

heterogeneity. After excluding any article, the results still 
suggested no statistical difference in MMSE scores between 
2 groups 2 days postoperatively, so these results were 
relatively stable and reliable (Fig. 9).
3.3.2.8. Meta-analysis of MMSE scores in patients 3 days 
after operation.  There were 37 articles reporting the MMSE 
scores of patients 3 days after operation, including 984 
and 981 from sevoflurane and propofol groups separately. 
Heterogeneity test (I2 = 91.1% and P < .10) detected a large 
heterogeneity across those selected articles, so the combined 
effects were analyzed with the random-effects model. 
It was found that MMSE scores were not significantly 
different between 2 groups 3 days postoperatively 
(SMD = −0.25, 95% CI: [−0.06, 0.56], P > .05). Because 
of the large heterogeneity across those enrolled articles, 
sensitivity analysis was performed through eliminating 
1 article each time, but the main source of heterogeneity 
was not discovered. When any literature was excluded, 
the results still demonstrated no significant difference in 
MMSE scores between 2 groups 3 days postoperatively, 
indicating the relative stability and reliability of our results 
(Fig. 10).
3.3.2.9. Meta-analysis of MMSE scores in patients 5 days after 
operation.  There were 3 studies mentioning the MMSE scores 
in patients 5 days postoperatively, including respective 156 from 
sevoflurane and propofol groups. A large heterogeneity was 
detected upon heterogeneity test (I2 = 95.1% and P < .10) across 
those enrolled articles, so we utilized the random-effects model 
to analyze combined effect. As a result, MMSE scores were not 
significantly different between 2 groups 5 days postoperatively 
(SMD = −0.77, 95% CI: [−0.35, 1.88], P > .05). Because of 
the large heterogeneity detected in our enrolled articles, we 
conducted sensitivity analysis through eliminating 1 study 
each time, but could not find the main source of heterogeneity. 
After excluding any literature, the results still revealed no 
significant difference in MMSE scores between 2 groups 5 days 
postoperatively, therefore, these results were relatively stable 
and reliable (Fig. 11).
3.3.2.10. Meta-analysis of MMSE scores in patients 7 
days after operation.  There were 14 studies reporting the 
postoperative MMSE scores of patients, including 763 and 764 
from sevoflurane and propofol groups separately. Heterogeneity 
test (I2 = 78.5% and P < .10) detected a large heterogeneity 
across those enrolled articles, so we utilized the random-effects 
model to analyze combined effect. It was discovered that MMSE 
scores were not significantly different between 2 groups 7 days 
postoperatively (SMD = −0.01, 95% CI: [−0.24, 0.22], P > .05). 
Because of the large heterogeneity detected across diverse 
articles, sensitivity analysis was carried out through eliminating 
1 article each time, which did not find the main source of 
heterogeneity. After excluding any literature, the results still 
suggested no significant difference in MMSE scores between 
2 groups 7 days postoperatively, demonstrating the relative 
stability and reliability of these results (Fig. 12).
3.3.2.11. Meta-analysis of MMSE scores in patients 3 months 
after operation.  There were 2 studies mentioning MMSE scores 
in patients 3 months postoperatively, involving 189 cases from 
sevoflurane group while 189 from propofol group. Heterogeneity 
test (I2 = 0.0% and P > .10) showed the absence of obvious 
heterogeneity across those enrolled articles, therefore, combined 
effect was analyzed using the fixed-effects model. Based on our 
findings, MMSE scores were not significantly different between 
2 groups 3 months postoperatively (SMD = −0.00, 95% CI: 
[−0.20, 0.20]) (Fig. 13).
3.3.3. Publication bias.  When 2 to 10 articles were enrolled 
in outcome indicators, publication bias was assessed by Egger 
test. As a result, publication bias was not detected in outcome 
indicators such as the POCD incidence 1, 3 and 12 hours, as 
well as 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days postoperatively.
When over 10 articles were included in outcome indicators, 
publication bias was assessed using the visual funnel diagram.

Figure 14 exhibits the funnel diagram of outcome indicators 
such as preoperative MMSE score, MMSE scores 6 hours, 1, 3 
and 7 days postoperatively. The points on the funnel diagram 
were scattered and not completely symmetrical, suggesting that 
there was a certain publication bias (Figure 14A–E).
4. Discussion
POCD, the frequent complication after general anesthesia and 
major surgery, has the typical features of difficulty in memory 
and recall, mental decline, being unable to accomplish tasks, 
inattention, language understanding impairment and social 
integration problems.[3] The course of POCD ranges from short 
to lasting and permanent. Because of the unobvious early symp­
toms, POCD can hardly be found by clinicians and family mem­
bers and is thereby neglected. According to Bedford research in 
1955,[56] about 10% of surgical cases suffered from long-time or 
persistent neurocognitive function decline after general anesthe­
sia and surgery. However, their work was limited at that time 
since the decline of cognitive function was determined only by 
the self-expression of patients and the description of their fam­
ilies, not by neuropsychological test results. After research for 
decades, cognitive decline after general anesthesia and major 
surgery, selection of general anesthesia and its relationship with 
POCD are still controversial.
Sevoflurane and propofol represent 2 frequently applied 
general anesthesia agents, and their anesthesia methods and 
mechanisms are different.[57] Sevoflurane exerts its anesthetic 
effect mainly by inhibiting N-methyl-D aspartate (NMDA) 
receptor. NMDA serves as the natural amino acid deriva­
tive in animals and a critical excitatory neurotransmitter l-
glutamic acid homologue within the mammalian central 
nervous system. After inhibiting the activity of NMDA, the 
synaptic transmission of cholinergic neurons and synaptic 
enhancement in hippocampus are inhibited.[58,59] Propofol is a 
short-acting intravenous anesthetic of alkyl acids, which takes 
effect quickly, can achieve the ideal anesthetic effect within 
40 seconds, and its efficacy is relatively stable. This anesthetic 
mainly exerts its anesthetic effect by enhancing the function 
of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, thus inhibiting the 
increased expression of hippocampal synapses.[60] When deal­
ing with the body internal and external environments, synaptic 
plasticity lays the basis for synapses to cope with the external 
environment.[61] Enhancement and inhibition are both normal 
neural responses of synapses to external environment, and 
their coordination together establishes the basis of learning 
and memory.[62] Obviously, both anesthetics affect the neu­
rological function of patients and play an anesthetic role. As 
reported in several clinical trials,[63,64] the selection of general 
anesthesia agents does not negatively affect the early postoper­
ative recovery quality, but these trials are limited by the small 
sample size and/or minor surgical research. Guo research[44] 
found that sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia had negative 
effects on early postoperative cognitive dysfunction among 
the old cancer patients, but there was no significant difference

between them, and there was no negative impact on patient 
life quality or prognostic outcome 3 months postoperatively. 
Egawa research[47] also found that the POCD incidence was 
not significantly different between sevoflurane and propofol 
anesthesia after lung surgery. Tang research[46] discovered that 
patients with rectal cancer achieved good neurological recov­
ery after sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia, but it seemed that 
patients who received propofol anesthesia had better cogni­
tion, yet the difference did not reach statistical significance. 
Qiao[45] suggested that the esophageal cancer patients who 
received major surgery with sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia 
had the increased POCD incidence relative to those undergoing 
intravenous propofol anesthesia. Ishii research[48] also found 
that the POCD incidence after propofol anesthesia (6.9%) 
markedly decreased relative to that after sevoflurane anesthe­
sia (26.7%). According to Zhang research,[49] compared with 
sevoflurane general anesthesia, propofol general anesthesia 
might reduce the postponed neurocognitive recovery among 
the elderly following large cancer surgery.
The 41 studies selected in the present work were all 
RCTs, with high meta-analysis quality and reliable results. 
Publication bias was assessed by Egger test for outcome indi­
cators, which revealed the absence of obvious publication bias 
in outcome indicators, such as the POCD incidence 1, 3, 12 
hours, and 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days postoperatively. In addition, 
we used visual funnel chart for evaluating publication bias for 
outcome indicators. The points on the funnel chart were scat­
tered and showed incomplete symmetry, revealing the presence 
of some publication bias. Our enrolled studies included sevo­
flurane/ether inhalation anesthesia for lung, esophageal, gas­
tric, colorectal, prostate, cervical and unclassified cancers, and 
the neurological status after propofol intravenous anesthesia. 
The results showed that sevoflurane/ether inhalation anesthe­
sia and propofol intravenous anesthesia reduced the postop­
erative cognitive function of patients with malignant tumors 
to varying degrees. Moreover, several studies[22,42,45,50,52] show 
that severe MMSE scores can be moderately reduced and the 
effect of sevoflurane is more obvious, but the MMSE scores are 
basically evaluated within 3 days after operation, and can basi­
cally return to normal levels after 5 days. A study[44] reported 
that the patients still had a slight decrease in MMSE scores 
3 months after operation, but the hospital stay of patients in 
this study was not prolonged and patients were not hospital­
ized again because of neurological adverse events, meanwhile, 
the neurological function status was not evaluated 3 months 
postoperatively. Generally speaking, these 2 anesthetics are 
not significantly different. According to our results, the POCD 
incidence was not significantly different between 2 groups. As 
revealed by subgroup analysis, the functions of sevoflurane/
ether inhalation anesthesia and propofol intravenous anesthe­
sia in postoperative cognitive function of cancer patients were 
not significantly related to the cancer types.
Certain limitations should be noted in this meta-analysis: 
firstly, MMSE score is simple and convenient to operate, and 
the score result is recognized by neurology and psychiatry, but 
there are subjective differences. Affected by age and education, 
patients receiving higher education probably have false nega­
tives, while patients receiving lower education can have false 
positives, and there are many items measured by this score, 
which is mainly sensitive to left hemisphere lesions-induced 
cognitive impairment, rather than to frontal lobe and right 
hemisphere lesions-induced one. Additionally, its effective­
ness on evaluating cognitive function of frontotemporal lobe 
is weak, and the score is poor in identifying mild cognitive 
impairment. Therefore, there may be some information bias in 
the results included in the study, which affects the reliability 
of the results in this meta-analysis to some extent. Secondly, 
in the process of anesthesia operation, different medical insti­
tutions and different doctors will use different doses of nar­
cotic drugs, and there are also differences in the use methods. 
For example, propofol can be administered through ordinary 
intravenous pumping and target-controlled infusion, besides, 
the anesthesia operation time of patients is different, and the 
postoperative recovery of patients is also different. Moreover, 
epidural anesthesia/peripheral nerve blocks is most probably 
added to general anesthesia in some cases. These factors will 
affect postoperative clinical outcome of patients to varying 
degrees.
To sum up, sevoflurane/ether inhalation anesthesia and 
propofol intravenous anesthesia may have different degrees

of negative effects on postoperative cognitive function among 
cancer patients, but there is no obvious long-term effect, and 
there is no obvious difference between the 2 anesthetics in 
their effects on postoperative cognitive function. However, our 
results should be further validated through large-scale, multi­
center RCTs.
