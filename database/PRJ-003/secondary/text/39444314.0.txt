Comprehensive risk management (RM) and usability engineering (UE) must be
performed to enable safe and usable interoperable medical device systems
(according to IEEE 11073 SDC). This has to be fulﬁlled by applying recognized
standards such as ISO 14971 (RM) and IEC 62366-1 (UE). Addressing the
complexity of use cases with multiple network participants requires deﬁning
use
context,
hazardous
situations,
user
proﬁles,
user
interfaces,
system
function contributions, limitations, conﬁgurations, and required conditions for
safe use. We propose extending the categories mentioned in IEEE 11073-
10700 with standardized user interface requirements provided by medical
device manufacturers. A consumer of networked services can consider those
UI Proﬁles containing design-, risk-, and process-related UI requirements
during its design phase, usability engineering process, and risk management.
This
allows
a
systematic
deﬁciency
analysis
prior
to
device
usage,
encompassing human-induced risks and thereby enhancing usability, patient
safety, and ﬁnally operational efﬁciency. Using benchmarked, veriﬁed, and
tested UI controls to create user interfaces that fulﬁll those requirements
automatically might also be a solution for the future. This work presents an
architectural
overview
incorporating
ISO
IEEE
11073-10700
standard
requirements.
Signiﬁcantly,
it
extends
these
standards
by
introducing
categories that
enhance
support
for
the
usability engineering
and
risk
management process, emphasizing the role of UI Proﬁles in achieving safe
and usable operating room environments with more ﬂexibility regarding
interoperability and enabling a human-induced risk analysis prior to device
usage. The number of surveyed manufacturers (8) and the need for real-world
validation are limitations of this work, which should be validated by future work.

1 Introduction
A medical device’s user interface must be designed according to previously speciﬁed
User Interface (UI) requirements, veriﬁed, and validated during the conformity
assessment. The situation becomes more complex when open interoperability, according
to the IEEE 11073 SDC (Service-oriented Device Connectivity) standard family, is
introduced
within
the
operating
room
(OR)
or
the
clinic.
SDC
deﬁnes
a
communication protocol that enables medical devices to communicate with each other
over the network by providing technical device descriptions and functionalities. In open
networks, multiple types of participants are involved, where one provides device

functionalities (SDC Provider), and the other consumes/uses such
services (SDC Consumer). Typical use cases are remote data
display or remote device control. Usability-related errors remain
a leading contributor to adverse events in healthcare (1–3).
The technical documentation becomes a challenge if the SDC
Consumer doesn’t have enough information from the SDC
Provider. Providing private, sensitive information to third parties
is not in the interest of the SDC Provider since it contains
internally valuable and critical information. Nevertheless, the
SDC Consumer has to develop some kind of user interface based
on the provided information and their own understanding of the
device. The SDC Provider has a very deep insight into its own
device. Performing risk assessments and applying and providing
UI Proﬁles can substantially harness the expertise of the Provider
and mitigate potential risks for the Consumer. With this method,
foreseeable risks can already be considered during the design
phase and be tested against in the veriﬁcation phase. This
information could be provided using different methods, but so
far, no standardized, machine-readable language exists to do this.
Both SDC and UI Proﬁle usage can signiﬁcantly impact patient
safety and clinical workﬂow in the operating room. While
interoperable medical device systems create use-cases, such as
remote
control
or remote monitoring,
they also
introduce
additional risks: Inconsistent user interfaces, mismatch between
remotely displayed and device information (e.g., different units),
unintuitive interfaces, or just missing essential information for
safe device operation. The controls used for critical tasks need to
be designed in a way to prevent accidental activation, for
instance, by requiring the user to conﬁrm critical adjustments (1)
or implementing design modiﬁcations (2).
These risks can interrupt clinical workﬂows, increase a user’s
mental workload, and overall increase the risk of human error.
By embedding UI Proﬁles into the development and evaluation
process, foreseeable device-related risks can be identiﬁed and
mitigated,
thereby
increasing
patient
safety
and
improving
clinical workﬂows.
Finally, a Health Delivery Organization needs testing tools and
processes to operate such interoperable systems. Without those,
having
open
SDC
interoperability
will
still
be
limited
to
manufacturer-to-manufacturer collaborations and solutions.
2 SDC—service-oriented device
connectivity
The BMBF (German Federal Ministry of Education and
Research)
lighthouse
research
project
“OR.NET—Secure
Dynamic Networking in the Operating Room and Clinic” (2012–
2016, funding no. 16KT1238) aimed to develop the technical
basis for safe and dynamic networking of components in the
operating room and clinic. An architecture and communication
language were developed, and novel approaches for trust and
distribution of responsibilities in open networked systems. The
SDC Standard family consists of three parts, which will be
explained in detail in the following subchapters (4, 5).
2.1 SDC core standards
The SDC core standards make technological interoperability
possible. By providing a foundation, structure, and semantics,
devices can communicate, discover each other, and interpret
messages in a standardized way.
ISO/IEEE 11073-20702: “Medical Devices Communication
Proﬁle for Web Services,” also known as MDPWS, enables the
foundation
for
interoperability
by
providing
the
ability
to
exchange data safely and discover network participants in a
distributed network via web services. It can be viewed as an
extension of DPWS for medical purposes (6).
ISO/IEEE 11073-10207: “Domain Information and Service
Model
for
Service-Oriented
Point-of-Care
Medical
Device
Communication,” also known as BICEPS (Basic Integrated
Clinical Environment Protocol Speciﬁcation), provides a semantic
description of medical device capabilities and state information
using a participant model (MDIB) and communication/message
model. It establishes a common language and structure to
exchange health-related information (7).
ISO/IEEE 11073-10101: Nomenclature and other coding
systems
deﬁne
how
medical
information
is
coded
and
categorized. This helps different healthcare devices and systems
understand
and
exchange
information
accurately.
This
nomenclature supports both the domain information model and
service model components and the semantic content exchanged
with medical devices (8).
ISO/IEEE
11073-20701:
“Point-of-care
medical
device
communication-Service
oriented
medical
device
exchange
architecture and protocol binding” deﬁnes the service-oriented
architecture and speciﬁes bindings toward other standards such
as NTP, Differentiated Services, QoS Requirements, −20702, and
−10207. Due to its binding nature, it is often referred to as “SDC
Glue.” (9).
2.2 Safety, trust & participants’
responsibilities
The Participant Key Purpose (PKP) is a set of requirements
that support manufacturers in making valid assumptions about
other network participants. This allows them to perform risk
management, veriﬁcation, and usability engineering for the safe
use of device functions. It also speciﬁes requirements for the
allocation of responsibilities. It is split into four parts, two of
which are in the proposal state and two of which are already
ﬁnished standards.
IEEE 11073-10700: “Standard for Base Requirements for
Participants
in
a
SDC
System”
speciﬁes
requirements
for
allocating responsibilities to SDC participants. Those enable
manufacturers
to
perform
risk
management,
usability
engineering, as well as veriﬁcation and validation (10).
IEEE 11073-10701: “Metric Provisioning by Participants in a
SDC System” deﬁnes requirements for SDC participants to
enable safe and secure contribution to clinical functions based on
Yilmaz et al.
10.3389/fdgth.2025.1520584
Frontiers in Digital Health

the exchange of metric information; this includes remote display,
partial automation of diagnosis and therapy, and changing settings
based on received metric information (11).
IEEE P11073-10702: “Standard for Alert Provisioning by
Participants in a SDC System” deﬁnes requirements to “[…] to
exchange alarm data and related remote control in a manner that
improves
safe,
secure
and
effective
contribution
to
the
functionality of a distributed system.” (12).
IEEE P11073-10703: “Standard for External Control by
Participants in a SDC System,” will deﬁne the rules, methods,
and requirements for external control.
2.3 Device specializations
IEEE P11073-10720: “Module Speciﬁcations for a Service-
Oriented Medical Device Exchange Architecture” speciﬁes how to
represent device components in a network, deﬁnes the device-type
independent use of term codes, and outlines communication rules,
while it doesn’t provide detailed rules for speciﬁc devices (13).
The 11073-1072X standards deﬁne the scope, structure, and
semantics of information and functionalities offered by a speciﬁc
class of devices. These encompass parameters like dependencies,
remote
control
commands,
technical
device
descriptions,
behavior in various states, and networking requirements. The
standards provide a framework to adhere to, enabling devices to
assume roles in networked systems (14). The research project
PoCSpec (Modular Specialisations for Point-of-Care Medical
Devices) developed standards for devices in the ﬁeld of high-
frequency
surgery
and
endoscopy.
By
conducting
regular
meetings with those vendors, consent was found between the
manufacturers for a standardized device standard (15).
3 User interface proﬁle
The device specializations (IEEE 11073-107XX) describe how
medical devices present themselves (their available functions) in
an SDC network and the technical requirements other network
participants must comply with to interact with them in a safe
way.
So
far,
those
device
proﬁles
do
not
include
HMI
characteristics, which are necessary for remote display and device
control and especially for safe and usable interfaces. Previous
work
identiﬁed
and
addressed
a
need
for
user
interface
requirements (16–22).
A device-speciﬁc user interface proﬁle was proposed, and
different but very similar deﬁnitions exist to date:
• 2016 from Thorn et al. (23): The UI proﬁle describes devices’
requirements for displaying their features and functions on
other devices. These are guidelines for visualizing metrics and
triggering actions based on information from ISO 24752
(Universal Remote Console). However, it does not prescribe
the
speciﬁc
design
of
the
user
interface
but
provides
limitations and suggestions for designing the interface.
• 2018 from Janß et al. (20): “Characteristics of input and output
devices as well as GUI interaction elements (size, position, etc.)
and their dependencies, criticalities of functions, grouping and
positioning information regarding interaction elements, etc.,
scenario-speciﬁc deﬁned performance shaping factors (PSFs),
e.g., environmental factors”
• 2022 from Yilmaz (author of this document) et al. (16): “A
device-speciﬁc set of requirements and speciﬁcations regarding
Human Machine Interactions a network subscriber must
fulﬁll, in order to operate medical device functions or to
display medical device properties.”
In earlier versions, the User Interface Proﬁle was based on ISO
24752, VDI 3850, Hölscher, Preim, Fellbaum, DIN EN ISO 7731,
DIN 894-1, DIN 894-2, DIN EN 60073, and ISO 9241 family
(such as −400, −420, −410, −303,). Figure 1 illustrates an earlier
version of the UI Proﬁle, outlining a more rigid categorization of
interface
elements
and
technical
requirements.
This
legacy
approach places strong emphasis on grouping, positioning, and
specifying ﬁxed dimensions and solutions
The approach from Janß et al. focused heavily on grouping,
positioning items, and the technical speciﬁcations of input and
output devices. This increases the chances of developing usable
interfaces but may limit the design freedom of a potential user. It
also
contains
technical
restraints
and
proposes
concrete
dimensions for visual elements. This version has been overhauled
to develop the current version of the UI Proﬁle (See Figure 2
and Table 1). It now doesn’t specify user interface controls or
control
mechanisms
but
focuses
additionally
further
requirements directly derived from risk management and (e.g.,
SDC-) standards (control speed, feedback mechanism, user task,
update frequency, labeling, display precision, etc.) in addition to
the
already
considered
usability
engineering
requirements
(effectiveness,
efﬁciency,
feedback,
labeling)
(16).
We
used
clinical use-cases to identify device-speciﬁc UI-requirements. The
use-cases included tele-supervision (24), ventilator development
(25),
common
neurosurgery
(26),
and
dorsal
cervical
decompression and spinal fusion for myelopathy treatment
employing surgical navigation. The categories of the UI Proﬁles
were iteratively presented and discussed with medical device
manufacturers, designers, and software developers. Requirements
from particular device standards such as the IEC 60601-2-2 for
high frequency devices were also included as far as applicable.
The goal was to systematically consider requirements from the
different stakeholders involved. They were also applied several
times by different users on medical devices (e.g., endoscopy,
high-frequency device, OR-light, infusion pump, and OR-table),
and some interfaces have already been evaluated by clinical users.
The formative evaluation of a user interface developed based on
using UI Proﬁles will be part of an upcoming publication.
Usability evaluations of SDC Workstations have already taken
place in smaller studies (24, 27, 28).
UI Proﬁles speciﬁcations can be included in an early design
phase
and
used
to
design
a
user
interface
that
meets
speciﬁcations determined by an SDC Consumer. In addition to
HMI-related risks, the technical speciﬁcations of input and

output devices also play a vital role. Wickel et al. proposed
technical
attributes
(idle
state,
actuation
force
threshold,
actuation area ratio, manual precision, etc.) for input devices to
be included in the ISO IEEE 11073-10207 (17).
4 Benchmarking of GUI elements
While developing a graphical user interface (GUI), a designer
has to consider the user’s knowledge, expertise, goal, experience,
environment, internal and external shaping factors, as well as
their
mental
workload
and
other
upcoming
performing
shaping factors.
In addition, a medical device’s GUI has to meet regulatory
requirements regarding risk and usability engineering, including
safety, efﬁciency, effectiveness, learnability, and user satisfaction,
according to IEC 62366-1. The chosen UI elements heavily
inﬂuence those categories. A radio button might be faster when
selecting one of two options, while a dropdown might be faster
for numerous options (29).
Almost all modern design guidelines have addressed the usage
of GUI elements and their characteristics; examples are shown in
(30–36). Those guidelines consider the number of options, the
type of task, the input device, size, and additional task-related
factors to create selection tables and matrices over the years,
containing partly HMI-related criteria (1, 37–39).
In previous work, UI elements from those guidelines have been
collected for mutually exclusive, non-mutually exclusive, and
numeric selections (40). Those UI Elements have different
efﬁciency, accuracy, and error rate characteristics while having
different labels and sizes. Different studies determined some of
those characteristics in 1995 (37) and 1999 (38). Since those
studies were performed more than 25 years ago, a lot has
changed. Tablets have higher resolutions, are more responsive,
and allow for faster interaction. UI elements have simple
animations during interactions, and their design has changed
(e.g., rounded corners, bigger interaction ﬁelds, more compact
and animated). More UI elements have been developed since
then [e.g., animated toggle buttons (31), chips (33)], and some
actions stemming from hardware buttons have been transferred
to touchscreens (e.g., swipe, rotate, tap and hold).
Some studies use “expert knowledge” or see the rendering task
as an optimization problem to determine the right UI elements,
their positioning, and their grouping (41). A study to determine
objective criteria to deﬁne UI elements’ efﬁciency, effectiveness,
and error rate is currently being conducted and could, therefore,
in the future, serve as a ﬁlter when choosing appropriate UI
elements using the UI Proﬁle.
5 SDC entities and their responsibilities
SDC Communication uses a service-oriented medical device
architecture (SOMDA), which has been standardized as part of
the IEEE 11073 SDC Standard (42). In this chapter, we will focus
on
tasks,
responsibilities,
and
requirements
of
different
participants in the SDC Architecture. The results of several
research projects and manufacturers’ efforts have been written
into the SDC standards. The PKP deﬁnes a set of requirements
that support manufacturers in making valid assumptions about
other
network
participants.
This
enables
performing
risk
management, veriﬁcation, validation, and, therefore, risk analysis
and usability engineering for the safe use of device functions. It
also speciﬁes requirements for the allocation of responsibilities
(10–12).
Several meetings were conducted with the IG-NB (alliance of
notiﬁed bodies for medical devices in Germany), during which
concepts for risk management in open networked solutions were
presented and discussed. In the latest Gemini SDPi Ecosystem
Pathway Summit 03/2024, a broad set of stakeholders, including
the FDA, IG-NB, 13 medical device manufacturers, and two
research
institutes,
discussed
ongoing
challenges
in
SDC,
including the regulatory pathway for market approval (43).
Figure 3 provides a high-level overview of SDC actors, their
responsibilities, tasks, and where a UI Proﬁle could be included.

It shows their respective roles and their relations with each other.
Directly affected participants in such a system are
• Responsible Organization (Also called Healthcare Delivery
Organization)
• Medical IT Network (Often part of the Healthcare Delivery
Organization)
• System Integrator [“Organizations that place SDC Systems on
the market” (44])
• Medical Device Manufacturer
• Users (Including clinical and non-clinical staff)
Indirectly affected participants are
• SDC Software Stack Supplier
• The Governance Body (Notiﬁed Bodies)
• Integrating Healthcare Enterprise (IHE)
While Figure 3 looks overwhelming, it might be noted that it is an
attempt to simplify 20 years of interoperability research into one
simple model without leaving out any stakeholders.
5.1 Accompanying information
A medical device manufacturer has to provide information
accompanying a medical device. The DIN EN ISO 20417 deﬁnes
Accompanying Information as information for the medical
device’s installation, use, decommissioning, and disposal (45). In
SDC Systems, the accompanying information is necessary for
outlining system functions, user requirements, conditions, and
use context that must be met for system functions to be
available.
Such
conditions
can
include
functional
tests,
redundancy
of
resources
and
networks,
and
labeling
requirements (10).
The
instruction
for
use
is
part
of
the
accompanying
information. It contains user-directed information essential for
the safe and effective use of a medical device or accessory (10, 45).
5.2 Risk management in SDC networks
Risk Management is still a challenge in open networked
solutions. There is an ongoing working group in the OR.NET
association
(“Conformity
assessment
and
regulatory
requirements”), which coordinates with the interest group of
notiﬁed bodies in Germany (IG-NB) to establish a strategy for
the approval of open networked medical devices (46). We will
give a short overview of challenges, the current approach, and
ongoing work.
5.2.1 Current challenges
When an SDC Provider provides its functionalities to SDC
Consumers, the Use Speciﬁcation of the SDC Consumer, ﬁrst of
all, is, in general, unknown to the SDC Provider. The SDC
Provider is responsible for providing his functionalities in the
way he documented them and by showing conformity to SDC
PKP standards. An SDC Consumer performs Risk Management
using this information and its Use Speciﬁcation.
Use Speciﬁcation is deﬁned in IEC 62366-1 as a “summary of
the important characteristics related to the context of the use of the
medical device.” This includes the intended medical indication,
patient population, intended part of the body to be interacted
with, the intended user proﬁle, the use environment, and the
operating principle (47).
In addition, external performing shaping factors also inﬂuence
device usage. Examples are situational characteristics (lighting,
noise, temperature), task and equipment characteristics (nature of
task, ergonomic, complex or poor interfaces), and job and task
instructions
(clear/unclear
or
poorly
written
instructions,
comprehensive/missing training) (48). The setup of the operating
room, frequency of use, and the positioning of the system might
also inﬂuence the user when interacting with medical devices
and need to be considered during risk management (47).
When using shared resources such as screens, network
bandwidth, or input devices, a proper allocation is mandatory.
This is part of the stated conditions for safe use and needs to be
fulﬁlled. The system owner is responsible for verifying this and
performing functional tests before device usage. Network issues
such as insufﬁcient bandwidth, loss of connection, malicious data
(cybersecurity), wrong patient/location association, wrong device
pairing, and use errors contribute to new causes and hazards and
must be considered during a risk analysis (10).
Security-related issues need to be addressed by a shared threat
modeling and analysis from device manufacturers, healthcare
providers, and the library supplier, as mitigations to cybersecurity
risk will fall under the responsibility of all involved parties. An
IEC 62304 documented library, which analyzed potential threats,
could support risk management (such as sdcX from SurgiTAIX).
Another
important
challenge
is
creating,
distributing,
and
managing SSL certiﬁcates for SDC devices. Currently, there are
no established processes for manufacturer-independent certiﬁcate
management. This will be addressed in the research project
Medi.NET (2024–2027).
5.2.2 Usability challenges
The Usability Engineering process and risk management of an
SDC Consumer must ensure that the use-related risks are identiﬁed
and mitigated, and that risk control measures are effective. This
presupposes that all causes of hazards are identiﬁed in the risk
analysis of the SDC Consumer.
While an SDC Provider can specify which requirements need
to be fulﬁlled by an SDC Consumer, this list of requirements is,
by all means, not complete because the SDC Provider does not
know in which use context and from which SDC Consumer their
device
will
be
controlled.
The
responsibility
to
state
an
interoperable use speciﬁcation (Use Environment, User Proﬁle)
lies with the SDC Consumer. It is the basis for risk management
and usability engineering.
We propose that the SDC Provider add standardized, machine-
readable user interface information to its device proﬁle. This has
already been proposed, but no machine-readable schema (e.g.,
XSD) has been deﬁned in SDC yet (19, 20, 22).

5.2.3 Feasibility of integration into existing
regulatory frameworks
UI Proﬁles, as proposed in this paper, can become a method to
systematically support regulatory requirements stated by the MDR
and FDA. Manufacturers can integrate UI Proﬁles into their design
dossier (supporting development, risk management, veriﬁcation,
and validation) to demonstrate that SDC Consumers have
systematically considered the new use context and other network
participants, as stated in the Base PKP Standard.
For instance, referencing UI Proﬁles through GUI development
and evaluation could illustrate how following standardized labels
and
symbols,
requirements
for
input
controls,
positioning,
grouping,
and
feedback
mechanisms
meet
other
SDC
Participants’ requirements for safe and usable interfaces.
While the approach will require further alignment, the UI
Proﬁle concept offers a structured format that could streamline
regulatory submissions by clarifying how user interface design
decisions address or mitigate relevant use errors.
6 Questionnaire: integrating user
interface proﬁles into the SDC
architecture
The primary goal of this chapter is to determine if UI Proﬁles
are necessary, beneﬁcial during the design and veriﬁcation phase,
capable of mitigating risks prior to device usage, and feasible for
use in developmental stages.
To evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of UI Proﬁles, a
questionnaire
was
ﬁlled
out
by
eight
medical
device
manufacturers
who
participated
in
the
“SDPi
Developer
Workshop 2024” (49). The workshop was chosen since medical
device
manufacturers
participated
with
experience
in
risk
management, SDC interoperability, and usability engineering.
The participation was voluntary. The questionnaire was designed
to gather feedback in four key areas: the necessity of UI Proﬁles,
their usefulness during the design process, their ability to
preemptively address risks, and their feasibility for usage by the
manufacturers.
Pre-testing
was
performed
with
associated
research assistants with experience in SDC, usability engineering,
and risk management.
Each participant was asked to rate 20 statements on a Likert
Scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The
results are displayed in Figure 4 (Need Assessment), Figure 5
(Development and Testing Phase), Figure 6 (Risk Analysis
Support), and Figure 7 (UI Proﬁle Creation Process) and
provide insight into manufacturers’ views toward UI Proﬁles.
6.1 Data analysis
The following subchapter discusses the rated statements in the
questionnaire as part of a descriptive and statistical analysis. We
performed a One-Sample Wilcoxon Test to determine if the
participants’ answers are signiﬁcantly tilted toward agreement or
disagreement rather than remaining near the midpoint (Neutral).
The results can be found in the attachment as well as behind
every
statement
in
the
descriptive
part
(*
for
statistically
signiﬁcant) (50).
6.2 Need assessment
Statement 1: A signiﬁcant number (75%) agree that the current
SDC standard lacks effective methods to share HMI requirements.
This highlights a gap in the SDC standards to ensure the
interoperability and usability of open integrated systems through
standardized HMI speciﬁcations.
Statement 2: Most respondents (62.5%) favor the creation of
device-speciﬁc
HMI
requirements
to
support
modular
risk
management.
It
indicates
a
need
for
developing
more
comprehensive guidelines within the SDC framework to facilitate
sharing HMI requirements.

Statement 3*: There is a strong consensus among manufacturers
(87.5%) not to share their own risk management ﬁles with unknown
SDC network participants. This reﬂects concerns about the
conﬁdentiality of sensitive information. It underscores the need for
safe and trusted mechanisms within the SDC framework to
transfer risk-related requirements for safe device use.
Statement 4: Most respondents (62.5%) want to deﬁne and
limit how their device is being used in an SDC network. That

means that there is a need to transfer requirements about device
usage to potential network partners.
6.3 Development and testing phase
Statements 5*, 6* and 7*: Most participants (87.5%) (strongly)
agree that UI Proﬁles could serve as input for the design phase and
that UI Proﬁles can specify those HMI requirements. All
participants
unanimously
agree
that
UI
proﬁles
support
consistency and standardization.
Statements 8 and
9: While some respondents (37.5%)
(strongly) agree that UI proﬁles can accelerate the design process,
a signiﬁcant portion (62.5%) remains neutral. The idea that the
number of formative tests would be reduced shows a mixed
reaction, where 50% stay neutral, 25% agree, and 25% disagree.
Statement 10: Most participants (62.5%) agree that UI proﬁles
are able to ensure that users receive adequate and correct
information during device operation. A UI Proﬁle delivered by a
medical device manufacturer supports this by providing clear and
standardized labels, units, and icons. However, 37.5% of neutral
responses suggest that some participants may have reservations
about the ﬂexibility of UI proﬁles in addressing all information
needed during device operation.
In a subsequent conversation, a manufacturer commented that
ﬂexibility is important for his medical device, where a conﬁrmation
window could be conditional. Certain numeric values might lead to
unsafe/dangerous states when changing a property. This is
inﬂuenced by multiple parameters, not just the metric itself.
Multiple formulas are used, and requirements are checked to
determine
whether
a
conﬁrmation
window
should
appear.
Currently, modeling such scenarios using the existing capabilities
of the UI Proﬁle or SDC is impossible. Whether such technical,
calculated, or simulated information used for risk mitigation
should be part of the MDIB or the UI Proﬁle is debatable. This
decision should be up to manufacturers working on a ventilator
device specialization.
Statement 11*: A signiﬁcant number of respondents (75%)
(strongly) agree that UI proﬁles support safe, effective, efﬁcient,
and learnable control of medical devices. This suggests a
strong belief in the value of UI proﬁles in improving medical
devices’ overall quality and usability. 25% of neutral responses
might indicate questions about their practical application in
all areas.
6.4 Risk analysis support
Statements 12 and 13: While 50% of participants (strongly)
agree that UI Proﬁles could preemptively identify human-
induced risks, the other half either remains neutral (37.5%) or
disagrees (12.5%). This suggests a need for more evidence
regarding the effectiveness of risk identiﬁcation.
Half of the participants (strongly) agree that UI Proﬁles can
systematically analyze and reduce UI deﬁciencies, while the other
half remains neutral. This neutrality reﬂects the identiﬁed need
for more evidence.
Statement 14: A majority (50%) (strongly) agree that UI
proﬁles could reduce the frequency of use errors, indicating a
belief in their potential to improve user interaction and reduce
errors. However, 37.5% of participants remain neutral, and 12.5%
disagree. This further highlights the need to demonstrate how UI
Proﬁles can effectively reduce errors.
Statement 15: The majority of respondents (62.5%) agree that
UI proﬁles can reduce cognitive load through standardization,
which is a positive indicator of their potential to enhance user
experience and operational efﬁciency.
Statement 16: A majority (62.5%) agree that UI proﬁles can
support compliance with SDC standard requirements, indicating
conﬁdence in UI Proﬁles’ ability to help meet regulatory and
standardization needs. Currently, only a few SDC medical devices
are on the market, and those are either from one manufacturer
or B2B solutions. This allows comprehensive risk management
on
the
basis
of
shared
documents.
Open
modular
risk
management cannot yet be conducted because the SDC-PKP has
not been ﬁnalized. The idea of providing requirements for safe
use
in
a
standardized
way
is
not
yet
in
the
minds
of
manufacturers, but it will be essential in the future.

frontiersin.org


Statement 17: The majority of participants (62.5%) have
expressed neutrality towards the idea that UI proﬁles support
systematic and effective risk management, while 37.5% (strongly)
agree with this statement. The lack of disagreement highlights
that there is no opposition to the concept, indicating a generally
positive attitude toward the potential beneﬁts of UI Proﬁles in
this area. The high neutrality suggests that practical examples are
needed to illustrate how UI Proﬁles contribute to a more
effective risk management process.
6.5 UI proﬁle creation process
Statements 18* and 19: The last three statements focus on the
process of UI Proﬁle creation. 87.5% of the participants (strongly)
agree that they could develop UI Proﬁles for their own devices with
in-house resources. Only 12.5% would prefer to get external
expertise to develop UI proﬁles. This emphasizes conﬁdence in
the manufacturers’ internal capabilities and in-house usability
and risk management knowledge.
Statement
20:
An
overwhelming
majority
(87.5%)
of
participants (strongly) agree that sharing process-related risks
using UI Proﬁles is a viable option for them. This is a positive
outlook and suggests that there is value in leveraging UI proﬁles
to facilitate transparent and effective sharing of risks among SDC
stakeholders. This broad acceptance and optimism indicate a
strong belief in the potential of UI proﬁles to enhance modular
and interoperable risk management processes.
6.6 Reﬂection on neutral responses
Across all answers, there has been a substantial number of
neutral responses in the Likert Scale. On one hand, this could
indicate limited familiarity with the concept of machine-readable
UI Proﬁles. On the other
hand, it could show that the
participants hesitated to answer before seeing a validation of the
evaluated user interfaces. Future studies should identify the
actual reason for the neutral responses by performing interviews
or adding text ﬁelds to gather more feedback.
6.7 Limitations and response bias
The participants of the survey had heard of the concept of UI
Proﬁles and had varying knowledge of the topic prior to the
workshop. Those with experience in UI Proﬁles might be biased
to give more positive or negative ratings. Additionally, the small
sample size limits the power of the statistical analysis and the
generalizability of the ﬁndings. While we performed a One-
Sample
Wilcoxon
Test
to
see
whether
each
statement
signiﬁcantly
differed
from
the
scale’s
neutral
point,
these
exploratory results must be interpreted with caution. With a
larger sample, the statistical signiﬁcance and effect sizes could be
more robustly estimated. We acknowledge this as a major
limitation of our current study.
The questionnaire was developed by drawing on established
risk-management
categories
derived
from
ISO
14971
and
usability categories from IEC 62366-1 and DIN 9241 standards,
combined
with
preliminary
expert
reviews
from
associated
researcher. However, the questionnaire has not undergone formal
validation. Future work should apply deeper validation methods
to strengthen the reliability and validity of our survey. Lastly, the
absence of formative real-world evaluations of user interfaces
developed based on UI Proﬁles is a limitation of this work and
should be performed in future work.
6.8 Ethical considerations
This study did not involve patient data or patient contact. All
participating medical device manufacturers were informed about
the scope and the purpose of the study. All responses were
treated conﬁdentially. No personal data (name, age, gender) has
been recorded. No formal ethics committee approval was needed.
7 Conclusion
The integration of User Interface Proﬁles into the existing SDC
architecture and standardization presents a pivotal advancement in
medical device interoperability within the clinic and the OR. Our
ﬁndings, supported by comprehensive feedback from medical
device manufacturers through a questionnaire, highlight the
critical need and beneﬁts of standardized UI Proﬁles.
Statements regarding the “development and testing phase”
received particularly positive and statistically signiﬁcant ratings,
suggesting that medical device manufacturers ﬁnd UI Proﬁles
especially valuable for guiding design and validation processes.
By contrast, most other statements showed weaker (p < 0.10) or
no statistical signiﬁcance—outcomes likely inﬂuenced by a small
pool of respondents rather than an absence of meaningful effects.
Consequently,
while
these
results
underscore
the
potential
beneﬁts of UI Proﬁles, they also highlight the need for broader
participation to solidify the statistical power and generalizability
of the ﬁndings.
A majority of respondents agreed that current SDC standards
lack effective methods for sharing risk-related requirements for
safe device usage, highlighting the existing gap that the UI Proﬁle
aims to ﬁll. Despite a signiﬁcant reluctance to share sensitive risk
management ﬁles with third parties, manufacturers still wish to
limit how other SDC participants use their devices, indicating a
clear need for UI Proﬁles.
Responses indicated high agreement that UI Proﬁles can serve
as input for the design phase, supporting consistency and
standardization. Additionally, feedback showed that UI Proﬁles
has the potential to support risk management through the
identiﬁcation and mitigation of human-induced risks. However,
the high percentage of neutrality (37.5%–62.5%) in the risk
analysis part suggests a need for concrete and practical examples
to demonstrate the beneﬁts of UI Proﬁles. The participants also
had reservations regarding a potential design process speed-up
Yilmaz et al.

Frontiers in Digital Health

and
the
question
of
whether
fewer
formative tests would
be necessary.
From a clinical standpoint, ensuring a consistent and risk-aware
user interface across multiple medical devices can signiﬁcantly
enhance patient safety by reducing the likelihood of use errors,
especially
in
high-stress
OR
environments.
Standardized
UI
Proﬁles have the potential to minimize confusion arising from
inconsistent labeling or UI design, and thus decrease human error
rates. Furthermore, designing, verifying, and using GUI elements
in line with these standardized proﬁles can foster the development
of user-friendly, device-speciﬁc GUIs, improve efﬁciency, and
ultimately improve patient outcomes.
By embedding such requirements into the development
lifecycle, organizations can more conﬁdently navigate regulatory
pathways, demonstrating alignment with recognized international
standards
and
focusing
on
patient-centered,
safe
device interoperability.
While our results show promise, the real-world validation of UI
Proﬁles remains to be conﬁrmed. We have yet to demonstrate the
direct clinical impact of UI Proﬁles. A validation study, including
user
testing
with
actual
medical
personnel
in
a
hospital
environment, is currently underway and will provide empirical
data on user performance, error rates, and efﬁciency.
By encapsulating design, risk management, and usability
engineering
aspects
into
machine-readable
UI
Proﬁles,
this
approach has the potential to signiﬁcantly enhance the safety and
usability of medical device interactions in open networks. It
helps to fulﬁll regulatory requirements stated by the FDA,
Notiﬁed Bodies for Medical Devices in Europe, and medical
device manufacturers (43). This work addresses a critical gap in
current interoperability standards by providing a standardized
method for communicating UI requirements across medical
devices, ensuring that interfaces are consistent and optimized for
user needs and safety requirements.
In actual clinical applications, the use of UI Proﬁles prior to
operation could enable device-to-device tests and provide testable
and objective criteria to prevent resource conﬂicts, such as not
having enough or suitable input, and output controls/devices (22),
conﬁrmations of critical functions prior to releasing (C-Ray, HF
power) or to fulﬁll requirements by particular device standards
(e.g., DIN EN 60601-2-2). Without those or similar UI Proﬁles,
providing
“real”
interoperability
becomes
a
challenge,
since
exchanging risk management and usability ﬁles are necessary to
develop an MDR and FDA-compliant, safe, and usable solution.
The proposal of a concrete schema for UI Proﬁles marks a
signiﬁcant
step
toward
achieving
automated
UI
generation
processes, supporting future dynamic creation of user interfaces
that fulﬁll the speciﬁc requirements of various medical devices,
potentially revolutionizing the way interfaces are designed and
implemented in networked operating rooms.
As the UI Proﬁle language evolves, it will be crucial to continue
reﬁning
the
XML-Schema
to
remain
adaptable
to
the
ever-changing landscape of medical technology and user needs.
The
collaborative
efforts
of
medical
device
manufacturers,
healthcare professionals, and regulatory bodies will be key in
advancing this initiative, aiming for a future where medical
devices not only communicate seamlessly but also contribute to
safer and more effective medical device control and, therefore,
better patient care.
In conclusion, the introduction of UI Proﬁles into the SDC
architecture represents an advancement in open, interoperable,
and user-centered medical device control systems. Using a
standardized approach to deﬁne UI requirements, this initiative
paves
the
way
for
fulﬁlling
SDC
standard
requirements,
mitigating risks already at the design phase, and creating safe,
effective, efﬁcient, and intuitive medical device interfaces.
