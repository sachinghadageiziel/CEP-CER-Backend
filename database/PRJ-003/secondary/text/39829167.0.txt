Introduction
Medical gases are fundamental in healthcare, supporting 
a range of treatments from respiratory assistance to 
anesthesia and diagnostics. Oxygen (O₂) is crucial for 
patients needing supplemental O₂ due to low blood oxygen 
levels, while nitrous oxide (N₂O) is a common anesthetic 
and analgesic in both dental and surgical settings. Carbon 
dioxide (CO₂) is used in minimally invasive surgeries to 
expand body cavities, allowing better visualization, while 
helium mixed with O₂ can help alleviate airflow resistance in 
patients with obstructed breathing conditions. Medical air 
is administered to aid breathing without causing hypoxia, 
and nitrogen is often applied to power medical devices or; 
preserve biological samples through freezing. Despite their 
benefits, these gases pose significant health risks when 
misused or overexposed. Medical gases, when improperly 
used or overexposed, can lead to a range of serious health 
issues. Neurological disorders may arise from exposure to 
N₂O, which can cause neurological deficits and cognitive 
impairments with prolonged use.1 Cardiovascular disorders 
are linked to air pollutants and particulate matter, which 
exacerbate ischemic heart disease and increase the risk of 
heart attacks.2 Furthermore, certain gases can contribute to 
inflammation and cancer development, particularly when 
they introduce harmful substances like heavy metals into 
the body.3 Gastrointestinal issues may also occur as a result 
of exposure to toxic gases, affecting digestion and organ 
function.4 Additionally, medical gases have been implicated in 
nephrological disorders and complications during pregnancy, 
as toxic exposures can adversely affect kidney function and 
fetal development.5 High O₂ levels can cause O₂ toxicity, 
leading to lung damage and oxidative stress, especially under 
hyperbaric conditions. Prolonged exposure to N₂O can lead 
to neurological damage and anemia, while excess CO₂ can 
result in respiratory acidosis and consciousness loss. Helium, 
although inert, can cause suffocation if inhaled in confined 
spaces without O₂, and nitrogen poses similar risks in closed 
environments by displacing O₂. The health risks associated 
with medical gas exposure underline the need for careful 
management and strict adherence to safety protocols in 
healthcare settings to ensure the well-being of both patients 
and medical professionals. Although specific global data on 
deaths solely from medical gas exposure is limited, general 
cases of toxic gas exposure (including gases like CO₂ is used in 
minimally invasive surgeries to expand body cavities, allowing 
better visualization) are significant. For example, unintentional 
carbon monoxide poisoning alone had a global mortality rate 
of approximately 0.366 per 100,000 in 2021.6 Long-term air 
pollution exposure, including medical and industrial gases, 
is linked to millions of premature deaths worldwide due to 
respiratory and cardiovascular conditions.7
Accurate sensing of medical gases is critical in healthcare 
to prevent gas-related pathological conditions and ensure 
patient and staff safety. Monitoring systems detect and 
measure gas concentrations, preventing excessive exposure 
to gases which can lead to serious health complications. 
Advanced gas detection systems also reduce the risk of 
accidental leaks or accumulation of gases in confined areas, 
which could otherwise cause suffocation or explosive hazards. 
By enabling real-time data on gas levels, these sensors 
ensure that gases are administered within safe limits and 
help healthcare facilities maintain regulatory compliance and 
effective risk management protocols for patient care and 
environmental safety.8 Medical gas sensors also play a critical

role in monitoring specific biomarkers in the human body, 
particularly volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can signal 
various diseases.9 Traditionally, gas sensing relied on detecting 
concentration levels through chemical reactions or resistance 
changes. However, recent advancements have seen artificial 
intelligence (AI) integration in these sensors, enhancing their 
capabilities by introducing complex data processing and 
pattern recognition. AI enables sensors to discern complex 
gas patterns that would otherwise go undetected, making 
it a valuable asset in healthcare diagnostics AI significantly 
enhances sensor capabilities by improving data processing, 
enabling sophisticated pattern recognition, and facilitating 
real-time diagnostics. Through advanced algorithms, 
AI empowers sensors to analyze large volumes of data 
quickly and accurately, which allows for the detection of 
subtle changes that may indicate underlying issues.10 This 
capability is crucial in various fields, particularly healthcare, 
where timely insights can lead to better patient outcomes. 
Moreover, the  ability of AI to recognize patterns in sensor 
data can help identify anomalies and trends, thus enhancing 
predictive maintenance and operational efficiency.11 Real-
time diagnostics are further bolstered by AI, as it can process 
incoming data instantaneously, providing immediate feedback 
that aids in swift decision-making and intervention.12 Despite 
the rapid advancements AI applications within the field 
of medical gas sensing, there remains a significant gap in 
comprehensive literature reviews that systematically address 
this intersection. Current studies primarily focus on the 
technical aspects of gas sensing and AI independently, rather 
than exploring their combined applications in healthcare 
settings. This lack of thorough review creates a barrier to 
understanding the full potential and challenges of integrating 
AI into medical gas monitoring systems. We aim to conduct 
a detailed literature study that synthesizes existing research, 
highlights successful implementations, and identifies areas 
needing further exploration. By filling this gap, we hope to 
provide valuable insights that can guide future research and 
enhance the development of AI-enabled medical gas sensors.
Data and Methods
We conducted an extensive review of the MEDLINE database 
via PubMed, focusing on English-language publications of 
any date. Our primary aim was to examine the behavior 
and interactions of key medical gases, including oxygen, 
nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and xenon. We 
explored both conventional and advanced methodologies 
for measuring these gases and included research on AI and 
machine learning (ML)–enhanced methods for sensing 
biological and medical gases. Studies were rigorously screened 
to exclude duplicates and non-English texts, with preference 
given to the most current and detailed articles where overlaps 
occurred. For inclusion, studies needed to be original research 
or clinical trials, both randomized and non-randomized, 
as well as experimental studies, prospective observational 
and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and 
review articles on medical gas sensing. Each qualifying study 
underwent detailed analysis, and supplementary references 
were consulted to ensure a thorough understanding of the 
topic.
Technological Innovations in Medical Gas 
Sensing Materials
Recent advancements in nanostructured materials and 
polymers have significantly enhanced medical gas sensing 
technologies, leading to improved sensitivity and selectivity. 
Researchers are increasingly utilizing nanomaterials such as 
nanowires, nanorods, and carbon-based structures due to 
their high surface area-to-volume ratio, which facilitates better 
gas adsorption and detection capabilities.13 These materials 
often exhibit unique electrical, thermal, and optical properties 
that can be fine-tuned for specific gas-sensing applications. 
Moreover, the integration of conductive polymers with 
nanostructures is proving beneficial, as these composites can 
enhance the overall performance of gas sensors by improving 
response times and stability under varying environmental 
conditions.14 Collectively, these developments pave the way 
for the creation of more efficient, miniaturized, and cost-
effective gas-sensing devices that are essential for various 
applications, including environmental monitoring and 
healthcare.15 Advances in nanotechnology have enabled the 
development of highly effective materials for gas sensing 
applications, particularly metal oxides and carbon-based 
nanomaterials. 
Sensitivity and surface reactivity of metal oxides
Metal oxides, including tin oxide, zinc oxide, and titanium 
oxide, are widely used in gas sensors due to their high 
sensitivity. Their large surface-to-volume ratio enhances 
interactions with gas molecules, making it possible to detect 
low concentrations of gases. When a target gas interacts with 
the metal oxide surface, a change in conductivity occurs, 
which the sensor measures. This makes metal oxides highly 
responsive to toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, ammonia, 
and nitrogen dioxide, even at trace levels. Moreover, these 
materials can be tailored to respond selectively to specific 
gases by modifying their surface properties, doping with other 
metals, or using catalysts, thus improving detection accuracy 
for particular applications, such as environmental monitoring 
or health diagnostics.16 
Carbon-based nanomaterials for volatile organic compound 
detection
Carbon-based nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes 
and graphene, exhibit exceptional electrical and thermal 
properties, which are ideal for gas sensing. The molecular 
structure of carbon nanotubes and graphene provides an 
expansive surface area for gas adsorption, and their electrical 
conductivity changes upon gas molecule interaction. These 
nanomaterials can detect VOCs, which are biomarkers for 
diseases like asthma and other respiratory conditions, by 
identifying unique compounds in exhaled breath. Additionally, 
they are effective in detecting VOCs related to environmental 
pollution, offering a powerful tool for maintaining air 
quality.17 
High selectivity through functionalization
Both metal oxides and carbon–based nanomaterials can 
be functionalized to improve selectivity, which is critical 
for distinguishing between similar gases. Functionalization

involves attaching specific chemical groups or nanostructures 
to the sensor material, enhancing its selectivity for a 
particular target gas. This characteristic is crucial in medical 
diagnostics, where detecting specific VOCs in the breath can 
signal the presence of disease. Metal oxides can be selectively 
modified to respond to individual gases, while carbon-based 
nanomaterials can be tailored to enhance detection of VOCs 
linked to metabolic or infection-related biomarkers.18
Stability and longevity
Metal oxides and carbon nanomaterials exhibit excellent 
stability, which is beneficial for sensors requiring long-term 
use in harsh conditions. Metal oxides, are durable under 
various environmental conditions, allowing for continuous 
monitoring of toxic gases without significant degradation. 
Similarly, carbon-based nanomaterials resist oxidation 
and maintain performance over extended periods, which 
is advantageous for medical diagnostics and industrial 
applications.19
Potential in data analysis and predictive modeling
Sensors based on metal oxides and carbon nanomaterials 
contribute data that, when analyzed with predictive modeling, 
can indicate trends or predict hazardous events.20 For 
instance, in healthcare, continuous monitoring of VOCs can 
provide data for predictive models to assess patient health 
status over time. In industrial settings, real-time data from 
sensors can predict toxic gas leaks, enhancing safety and 
preventative measures.21
Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and 
Neural Networks for Medical Gas Sensing
AI encompasses a broad range of technologies aimed at 
enabling machines to perform tasks that requires human-
like intelligence. Key areas in AI include natural language 
processing, computer vision, and decision-making, all of 
which depend on complex algorithms and large data sets. AI 
seeks to automate processes, make predictions, and perform 
cognitive tasks, with applications spanning healthcare, 
finance, manufacturing, and beyond. In recent years, 
advancements in AI have led to the development of systems 
that can analyze vast amounts of data, find patterns, and 
make informed decisions faster and often more accurately 
than humans can.22 In an AI system, knowledge, algorithms, 
and goals are essential inputs that guide the agent’s actions. 
Knowledge provides the agent with background information 
and rules, algorithms enable it to process inputs and make 
decisions, and goals define the desired outcomes. The 
agent interacts within an environment where it perceives 
observations, like data from sensors or external stimuli, to 
determine appropriate actions. Forward feedback occurs 
as the agent’s actions influence the environment, while 
backward feedback provides information about the success 
of its actions, helping to adjust future decisions. In a block 
diagram (Figure 1), this flow can be visualized with nodes for 
input (knowledge, algorithm, goals), processing (decision-
making of agent), and output (actions and feedback loop 
from the environment). Table 1 outlines various applications 
of AI within the healthcare system.

ML is a subset of AI focused on developing algorithms 
that enable systems to learn from data and improve their 
performance over time without explicit programming. 
ML algorithms analyze data, detect patterns, and make 
predictions by adjusting parameters based on feedback from 
their performance. These algorithms are categorized into 
supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each 
used for different types of tasks and data structures. ML is 
widely applied in areas such as recommendation systems, 
fraud detection, and medical diagnosis, helping systems adapt 
and evolve in response to new data.22 Figure 2 illustrates a

phases: data processing, training, and testing. Initially, 
the system generates raw data, which is then processed 
by extracting relevant features and targets, followed by 
data cleaning, and the application of feature importance 
techniques to enhance the data quality. In the training phase, 
models are developed to estimate specific targets, such 
as output power, coupling coefficient, and load resistance. 
These models are evaluated based on accuracy. In the testing 
phase, the system uses these trained models to process test 
data, identify the on and off regions, and decide whether the 
system should be turned on or off. If conditions are met, the 
system activates; otherwise, it shuts down, forming a feedback 
loop for continuous operation and decision-making.

using another set of weights, known as linear weights, to 
produce a final output. This structure allows networks to 
approximate complex functions and patterns by leveraging 
localized responses in the hidden layer, making them suitable 
for tasks like function approximation, pattern recognition, and 
time-series prediction.
Neural networks, inspired by the structure of the human 
brain, are a crucial aspect of deep learning within ML. They 
consist of layers of interconnected nodes (or “neurons”) that 
process input data in ways that mimic how neurons process 
signals. Through multiple layers and adjustments based 
on training data, neural networks can recognize complex 
patterns and perform sophisticated tasks, such as image and 
speech recognition. By using backpropagation and gradient 
descent, neural networks fine-tune their internal parameters 
to reduce error rates, becoming more accurate over time. 
These networks have led to significant advances in fields 
like autonomous vehicles and medical imaging.23 Figure 3 
illustrates a simple neural network, which consists of three 
main layers: the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output 
layer. The input layer receives multiple input signals (orange 
nodes), which are then processed through a set of weight-

In AI-enabled medical gas sensing, commonly used advanced 
ML algorithms techniques include convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks, and support 
vector machines (SVMs).24 CNNs excel at recognizing spatial 
patterns and gas distributions, while recurrent neural 
networks are well-suited for analyzing temporal data, enabling 
real-time monitoring of gas concentration changes.24,25 
SVMs are particularly effective for classification tasks, such 
as differentiating various gas types or diagnosing medical 
conditions based on sensor readings.26 These advanced 
methods address the limitations of traditional approaches, 
which are often constrained by linear modeling, noise 
interference, and poor accuracy in dynamic or multi-gas 
settings. By leveraging capabilities such as noise reduction, 
complex pattern recognition, and predictive analysis, these 
algorithms enable more precise, adaptable, and efficient 
detection. For instance, ML models trained on extensive 
datasets can discern subtle gas concentration variations linked 
to specific health conditions.27 This adaptability and accuracy 
provide a significant advantage in medical applications where 
sensitivity and reliability are critical. AI is also revolutionizing 
the field of medical gas sensing by enhancing signal 
transduction techniques and data interpretation capabilities. 
This development is leading to significant improvements in 
sensitivity, specificity, and real-time data processing. These 
advancements are critical in fields such as medical diagnostics, 
environmental monitoring, and biochemical sensing, where 
precise and timely detection of target molecules or biomarkers 
is essential.

Artificial intelligence–powered signal transduction
AI algorithms enable more efficient data processing from 
gas sensors, devices that convert biological responses into 
electrical signals. AI-based models, such as neural networks 
and ML algorithms, can interpret complex signal data patterns, 
improving detection systems' accuracy. For instance, AI can 
continuously monitor and analyze medical gas sensor data 
streams to detect minute changes in analyte concentrations, 
allowing for more rapid and sensitive detection of target 
substances, even in background noise.28 This continuous real-
time monitoring is especially beneficial in clinical diagnostics, 
where detecting early signs of disease can improve patient 
outcomes.
Enhancing sensitivity and specificity
Sensitivity and specificity are two critical metrics in medical 
gas sensing. Sensitivity refers to the ability of a sensor 
to correctly identify true positive cases, while specificity 
refers to the ability to accurately identify true negatives.29 
AI enhances these metrics by reducing errors in signal 
interpretation. For example, deep learning algorithms 
can distinguish between similar medical gas-converted 
biochemical signals, enhancing both sensitivity and 
specificity. This precision is especially valuable in fields like 
cancer detection, where high sensitivity and specificity are 
crucial to avoid false positives and negatives. By filtering 
and processing data with ML models, gas sensors can 
provide highly accurate and reliable results. The microscopic 
mechanism of advanced materials such as metal oxides 
and carbon-based nanomaterials in medical gas sensing 
lies in their specialized surface characteristics and ability 
to interact electronically with gas molecules.30 Metal 
oxides such as ZnO and SnO₂ offer specific sites for gas 
adsorption and chemisorption.31 These interactions result 
in measurable changes in electrical properties, such as 
resistance, facilitating gas detection. Similarly, carbon-based 
nanomaterials, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, 
exhibit exceptional conductivity, large surface areas, and 
tunable functionalization, which enhance their sensitivity 
and selectivity for specific gas molecules.32 When integrated 
with AI, the sensor outputs of these materials are optimized 
through advanced ML techniques. AI algorithms, such as 
CNNs and SVMs, analyze intricate data patterns to identify 
gases more accurately. CNNs are adept at processing spatial 
variations in sensor signals, while SVMs excel at classifying 
sensor responses based on specific gas characteristics. 
This synergy enhances sensitivity, improves selectivity, and 
ensures greater resistance to environmental noise and 
interference, addressing the limitations of traditional gas 
sensing methods.
Real-time processing and decision-making
One of the most impactful contributions of AI in signal 
transduction is real-time data processing. AI algorithms can 
rapidly interpret large amounts of data from gas sensors, 
enabling immediate feedback and decision-making. This is 
achieved through techniques like real-time signal processing 
and predictive modeling, which allow gas sensors to provide 
continuous updates on analyte concentrations or the presence 
of specific biomarkers.33 In healthcare, such real-time analysis 
can aid in critical monitoring scenarios, such as intensive care 
units or during surgeries where instant detection of abnormal 
biochemical changes is essential.
To ensure accurate and reliable AI-based real-time monitoring 
in medical scenarios, particularly under challenging conditions 
like high humidity or electromagnetic interference, the 
following approaches are essential34:
Durable sensor design: Developing sensors with materials and 
coatings that resist humidity and electromagnetic interference 
can enhance performance. Protective encapsulation and 
designs that reduce noise are effective solutions.
AI-powered noise reduction: Machine learning models can 
effectively filter out noise caused by environmental factors. 
These algorithms help differentiate genuine signals from 
disruptions created by electromagnetic interference or 
humidity fluctuations.
Dynamic calibration: Integrating real-time calibration systems 
allows the sensor to adjust its baseline automatically in 
response to environmental changes, ensuring consistent 
accuracy.
Secure data transmission: Utilizing reliable Internet of Things 
(IoT) protocols and blockchain technology ensures that data 
shared between sensors and medical systems remains secure 
and precise during transmission.
Robust testing: Conducting thorough testing under simulated 
harsh conditions before deployment ensures the system 
performs reliably in real-world environments.
These strategies together enhance the robustness, precision, 
and dependability of AI-based medical monitoring systems, 
even in demanding conditions.
Pattern recognition by artificial intelligence models
AI models rely on several characteristic parameters for 
identifying and distinguishing different types of medical gases 
such as O₂, N₂O, and CO₂. The primary parameters include:
Spectroscopic signatures: Gases exhibit unique absorption 
or emission spectra at specific wavelengths, allowing AI to 
distinguish them based on spectroscopic patterns.35 For 
example, infrared absorption characteristics are commonly 
used for CO₂ detection, while ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 
may aid in identifying O₂ and N₂O.
Concentration levels: AI systems analyze gas concentration 
patterns in the medical environment, measured in parts 
per million (ppm) or other units.36,37 Thresholds for safe or 
expected concentrations serve as baselines for recognition.
Electrical properties: Changes in resistance, capacitance, or 
voltage across sensor materials can vary with different gas 
interactions, enabling pattern differentiation by AI models. 
For instance, interdigitated electrodes detect variances in gas-
specific conductivity changes.38,39
Chemical reactivity: AI evaluates gas-specific reactions with 
sensor coatings or catalysts, producing distinct chemical 
byproducts or signals for identification.40

These parameters are chosen based on their ability to provide 
clear, reproducible signals that differentiate gases effectively, 
while ensuring compatibility with the sensor’s material and 
medical application context.
Self-Powered Gas Sensors for Continuous 
Monitoring
Self-powered gas sensors are innovative devices that generate 
their energy, eliminating the need for batteries or external 
power sources. These sensors typically harness energy from 
ambient sources such as kinetic, thermal, or electromagnetic 
energy, making them suitable for continuous, long-term 
monitoring applications. This capability is particularly 
beneficial in health care, where sensors can continuously 
monitor physiological conditions and environmental 
factors, providing doctors and biomedical engineers with 
precise, real-time data to optimize health management 
without frequent maintenance or power replacement. 
Additionally, advancements in wireless communication, such 
as 5G technology, can support these sensors by supplying 
power through wireless transmission, further enhancing 
their autonomy and reliability for remote or hard-to-reach 
locations.42 The development of wearable, self-powered 
devices for medical gas sensing represents a significant 
advancement in continuous health monitoring. These devices 
use flexible gas sensors to detect biomarkers in breath or 
skin emissions, enabling real-time, non-invasive assessment 
of health conditions. Powered by energy harvested from 
the body or environment, such as body heat or motion, 
they eliminate the need for frequent battery replacements, 
increasing their practicality for long-term use. Continuous 
monitoring through these sensors allows for early detection 
of potential health issues, such as respiratory or metabolic 
disorders, by identifying abnormal levels of gases like O₂, CO₂, 
or VOCs.8 This capability enhances disease management and 
preventive healthcare, helping individuals and healthcare 
providers monitor health dynamically and respond swiftly to 
changes in physiological states.43 Innovative materials and 
energy-harvesting technologies are revolutionizing the way gas 
sensors operate by enabling them to function autonomously 
with minimal intervention. These advancements leverage 
ambient energy sources, such as solar, thermal, and 
vibrational energy, allowing gas sensors to generate 
power from their surroundings without needing external 
power sources or frequent maintenance.44 By integrating 
such technologies, systems can achieve greater longevity 
and reliability, ultimately leading to smarter and more 
sustainable environments. AI and ML significantly enhance 
self-powered sensors by enabling continuous monitoring of 
various parameters without the need for external power or 
frequent maintenance. These technologies allow sensors 
to autonomously analyze data in real-time, improving 
accuracy and responsiveness. For instance, AI algorithms can 
process complex data streams from biosensors, facilitating 
rapid detection of changes in conditions, which is crucial in 
applications such as health monitoring and environmental 
sensing.45 Furthermore, the integration of ML with energy 
harvesting technologies enhances the functionality of sensors, 
enabling multifunctional capabilities that support advanced 
applications in smart systems. 
Development of a Real-Time Learning System 
for Medical Gas Sensing
The development of real-time learning systems for medical 
gas sensing is an innovative approach that combines 
advanced sensor technology with AI to enhance healthcare 
monitoring. These systems are designed to continuously 
track the concentration of gases used in medical 
environments, such as O₂ and N₂O, ensuring patient safety 
and optimal treatment conditions. By utilizing flexible 
gas sensors, researchers have made significant strides in 
improving the sensitivity and accuracy of these devices.8 A 
recent study highlights the implementation of deep learning 
algorithms to facilitate real-time monitoring and leak 
detection in compressed medical gas systems.46 These AI-
driven systems analyze data streams from the gas sensors, 
allowing for immediate identification of anomalies and 
reducing the risk of hazardous situations.46 Moreover, the 
integration of IoT technologies enhances the capabilities of 
these systems, enabling remote monitoring and automated 
responses to changing gas levels.47 Additionally, research 
into AI-enhanced sensors focuses on improving the materials 
and structures of these devices to increase their efficiency 
and longevity.12 By leveraging real-time learning, healthcare 
providers can ensure a safe and responsive environment, 
ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. The 
block diagram represents a comprehensive system for 
data collection, processing, and analysis, leveraging IoT 
networks, AI, and ML to enable predictive maintenance 
and performance optimization. Starting with the System 
and Sensors component, data is gathered through an 
IoT network using industrial bus, wireless link, or fiber 
optics connections. This network (illustrated in Figure 
4) integrates with various hardware interfaces, such as 
controllers, communicators, and screens on tablets or 
personal computers (labeled printed circuit board designed 
and human machine interface), allowing user interaction 
and monitoring. Data collected is sent to a Cloud server via 
4G or 5G networks, where it is stored in the Data storage 
component. The data undergoes Signal conditioning 
processes—cleaning, synchronization, and segmentation—
to prepare it for further analysis. Following conditioning, 
a Signal profile is created and processed through Feature 
extraction in time, frequency, and time-frequency domains. 
Extracted features are stored in the Feature library, which 
works in conjunction with a Model library and an Analytics 
engine. This analytics engine provides insights, including 
health assessments, performance optimizations, and 
predictive maintenance recommendations. Additionally, Web 
services connect the Analytics database to user devices over 
4G/5G/Wi-Fi, allowing remote access and real-time updates 
via the internet protocol network, thus enabling continuous 
monitoring and decision-making.

in the lungs. In the realm of cancer detection, AI-powered 
gas sensors are capable of distinguishing between healthy 
and malignant tissues by analyzing breath samples. Studies 
have demonstrated that these gas sensors can detect unique 
patterns of gases released by tumors, allowing for the early 
identification of diseases such as lung and colorectal cancer. 
By integrating ML algorithms, these systems enhance their 
diagnostic accuracy by learning from large datasets of 
breathomics, improving the identification of subtle biomarkers 
that indicate disease.48 Moreover, AI systems can differentiate 
various metabolic disorders by analyzing changes in breath 
composition. For example, patients with diabetes often exhibit 
increased levels of acetone in their breath. AI models can 
monitor these fluctuations in real time, providing continuous 
health insights and enabling timely interventions.49 This 
innovative approach not only facilitates earlier diagnosis but 
also promotes personalized medicine by tailoring treatment 
plans based on individual biomarker profiles. Overall, AI-
enabled breath analysis systems represent a promising 
frontier in medical diagnostics, combining cutting-edge 
technology with practical healthcare applications to improve 
patient outcomes.
Several other pilot projects and clinical cases have explored 
the integration of AI with medical gas-sensing technology for 
continuous monitoring and predictive diagnosis. Key examples 
include:
Remote patient monitoring: AI-enhanced sensors integrated 
into the Internet of Medical Things systems have been used 
to continuously track patients’ O₂ levels and respiratory 
gases, enabling early detection of hypoxia or hypercapnia. 
These systems utilize real-time AI algorithms to process data 
and alert healthcare providers when abnormalities occur, 
improving patient outcomes and reducing hospitalization 
rates.50
Predictive analytics for respiratory conditions: Pilot studies 
have leveraged AI models to analyze CO₂ and O₂ patterns in 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sleep 
apnea. These models predict exacerbations, allowing timely 
interventions.51
Achievements
Early intervention: Enhanced detection of respiratory distress 
before symptoms become severe, preventing complications.
Personalized care: Continuous monitoring tailor treatment 
plans to individual needs, improving healthcare outcomes.
Operational efficiency: AI integration reduces the burden on 
healthcare providers by automating data analysis and alerts.
Challenges

Review
Integration barriers: Ensuring seamless compatibility with 
existing healthcare systems requires substantial effort.
Future Directions and Emerging Trends
The future of telemedicine is poised for significant 
transformation through IoT technologies and advancements 
in AI. This synergy enhances remote patient monitoring, 
facilitates real-time data collection, and enables personalized 
healthcare solutions. IoT devices can continuously gather 
health metrics from patients, transmitting this information 
to healthcare providers who can use AI algorithms to 
analyze medical gas sensing patterns and detect anomalies. 
Emerging trends also indicate a shift towards greater 
personalization in healthcare, driven by AI methodologies. 
These systems can adapt treatments based on individual 
patient data, preferences, and responses, leading to more 
tailored healthcare experiences. Additionally, AI can enhance 
preventive healthcare applications by identifying risk factors 
by medical gas overdoses early through predictive analytics, 
potentially preventing the onset of chronic diseases. Material 
innovations are also critical, particularly in the development 
of more sophisticated gas sensors and wearable devices 
that improve data accuracy and reliability. This includes 
advancements in flexible electronics and biocompatible 
materials that allow for more comfortable and effective 
monitoring solutions. In conclusion, the integration of IoT with 
telemedicine, combined with innovative AI approaches and 
material technologies, holds the potential to revolutionize 
healthcare delivery, making it more efficient, personalized, 
and preventive.
Challenges and Limitations in Artificial 
Intelligence–Enhanced Medical Gas Sensing
The integration of AI in medical gas sensing technologies 
presents several challenges and limitations that impact 
their effectiveness and reliability. One significant issue is 
gas sensor accuracy, which can be compromised by factors 
such as calibration drift and environmental conditions. For 
instance, variations in temperature and humidity can lead to 
inconsistent sensor readings, making it difficult for AI models 
to deliver precise predictions.12 Moreover, the robustness of 
AI models is critical for their application in gas sensing. Many 
AI algorithms operate effectively in controlled environments 
but struggle to generalize in real-world scenarios where 
data is noisy and varied. This “black-box” nature of AI can 
also lead to challenges in interpretability, making it hard to 
understand the model’s decision-making process.52 To address 
these issues, there is a pressing need for standardized data 
collection protocols. Consistent and reliable data gathering 
can enhance the quality of the datasets used for training 
AI models, ultimately leading to improved performance in 
medical gas sensing applications.53 Additionally, minimizing 
sensor noise and interference—through better sensor design 
and signal processing techniques—is essential for achieving 
accurate and actionable insights in real-world applications.54 In 
summary, while AI-enhanced gas sensing holds great promise, 
overcoming the limitations related to sensor accuracy, model 
robustness, and environmental influences is crucial for 
realizing its full potential.
Limitations
Incomplete integration of artificial intelligence and medical 
gas sensing
While AI applications have advanced, the integration of AI 
with medical gas sensing remains underexplored, with many 
studies focusing on either domain independently. This limits 
a comprehensive understanding of their combined potential 
and challenges.
Variability in environmental factors
Medical gas sensing technologies often struggle with 
consistency due to environmental factors such as temperature 
and humidity. These variables can distort sensor readings and 
affect AI model accuracy.
Data quality and availability
A lack of standardized protocols for collecting and managing 
data compromises the reliability of datasets used to train 
AI models, thereby reducing their generalizability and 
robustness.
Technical and interpretative challenges in artificial intelligence
Many AI models operate as “black boxes,” where decision-
making processes are not easily interpretable. This makes it 
difficult to validate the reliability of AI-enhanced medical gas 
sensing systems.
Scalability issues
While promising, these systems are not yet scalable for 
widespread clinical application due to high costs, limited 
compatibility with existing infrastructures, and regulatory 
hurdles.
Conclusions
The review underscores the transformative potential of 
integrating AI into medical gas sensing for enhanced accuracy, 
real-time monitoring, and improved healthcare outcomes. 
Advancements in sensor materials, such as nanostructures, 
combined with AI, present significant opportunities for 
detecting subtle gas patterns linked to health conditions. 
However, overcoming challenges like data quality, environmental 
variability, and interpretability is critical for future development. 
Addressing these limitations will pave the way for more reliable, 
scalable, and cost-effective solutions in healthcare diagnostics.
