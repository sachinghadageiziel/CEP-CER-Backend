Abstract
Background: Posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion is an established surgical pro-
cedure for the correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Intraoperative neurophysi-
ological monitoring is standard practice for this procedure. Anesthetic agents can have 
different, but significant, effects on neurophysiological monitoring outcomes.
Aim: To determine if intravenous lidocaine infusion therapy has an impact on the in-
traoperative neurophysiological monitoring during posterior spinal instrumentation 
and fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.
Methods: Following ethical approval, we conducted a retrospective review of charts and 
the archived intraoperative neurophysiological data of adolescents undergoing poste-
rior spinal instrumentation and fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Intraoperative 
neurophysiological monitoring data included the amplitude of motor evoked potentials 
and the amplitude and latency of somatosensory evoked potentials. A cohort who re-
ceived intraoperative lidocaine infusion were compared to those who did not.
Results: Eighty-­one patients were included in this analysis, who had surgery between 
February 4, 2016 and April 22, 2021: 39 had intraoperative intravenous lidocaine 
infusion and 42 did not. Based on hourly snapshot data, there was no evidence that 
lidocaine infusion had a detrimental effect on the measured change from baseline 
for MEP amplitudes in either lower (mean difference 41.9; 95% confidence interval 
−304.5 to 388.3; p = .182) or upper limbs (MD −279.0; 95% CI −562.5 to 4.4; p = .054). 
There was also no evidence of any effect on the measured change from baseline for 
SSEP amplitudes in either lower (MD 16.4; 95% CI −17.7 to 50.5; p = .345) or upper 
limbs (MD −2.4; 95% CI −14.5 to 9.8; p = .701). Finally, there was no evidence of a dif-
ference in time to first reportable neurophysiological event (hazard ratio 1.13; 95% CI 
0.61 to 2.09; p = .680).
Conclusions: Data from these two cohorts provide preliminary evidence that intrave-
nous lidocaine infusion has no negative impact on intraoperative neurophysiological 
monitoring during PSIF for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.

1  |  INTRODUCTION
Posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion is a common surgi-
cal procedure for correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. It 
is a major surgical insult that can be associated with significant 
postoperative pain.1 Multimodal analgesia is utilized periopera-
tively to help prevent and manage this pain. It is important to 
minimize the requirements for any individual analgesic modality 
to minimize their potential side effects.2,3 This is especially true 
for opioids, which have a dose-­dependent side effect profile.4 
Lidocaine has been used as a peri-­operative adjuvant to multi-
modal analgesia to help improve postoperative pain and minimize 
opioid requirements.5–7 Its efficacy and safety have been estab-
lished in adults.8
Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONPM) is stan-
dard of care for PSIF procedures.9 It involves the integration of so-
matosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), transcranial motor evoked 
potentials (MEPs), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electromyogra-
phy (EMG). IONPM helps to ensure the integrity of the motor and 
sensory spinal cord pathways and issues alerts in the event of po-
tential spinal cord impairment, allowing for intervention to mitigate 
injury progression or reversal of potential neurological sequelae. 
Anesthetic agents can have significant effects on IONPM; for in-
stance, inhalational agents adversely affect SSEPs and MEPs, and 
muscle relaxants can impact MEPs and EMG.10,11
While there is limited data on adolescents, adult studies have re-
ported reduced amplitude and increased latency of SSEP responses 
in patients receiving intraoperative lidocaine infusion when under-
going abdominal or orthopedic surgery12 and absent or reduced 
SSEP amplitudes following lidocaine administration in scoliosis 
surgery.13
The aim of this study was to investigate whether intraopera-
tive intravenous lidocaine infusion therapy (I-­IVLT) has any impact 
on the reliability of IONPM monitoring in adolescents undergoing 
PSIF for idiopathic scoliosis, principally to support the continued 
use of lidocaine infusion therapy as an adjunct to multimodal anal-
gesia without compromising patient safety. Specifically, we aimed 
to evaluate the evidence for any differences in hourly-­sampled 
measurements of MEP amplitude, SSEP amplitude and SSEP la-
tency, for both upper and lower limbs, in adolescent patients re-
ceiving an intraoperative lidocaine infusion during PSIF surgery 
compared with a similar cohort, who did not receive lidocaine. We 
also aimed to evaluate any differences in the number of reportable 
neurophysiological events, based on clinical alert criteria for ac-
ceptable deviation of these measurements from baseline, or time 
to first event.
2  |  METHODS
2.1  |  Study design
We conducted a single-­centre retrospective review of PSIF 
procedures for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, comparing a cohort 
of cases in which lidocaine was infused intraoperatively with a 
similar cohort in which no lidocaine was given. Electronic records 
were reviewed for relevant anesthetic and surgical information, 
including which patients received I-­IVLT. IONPM data were retrieved 
from archived data held within the neurophysiology department 
for each patient. The study was approved by the University of 
British Columbia/Children's and Women's Health Centre of British 
Columbia Research Ethics Board (H20-­01875), including waiver of 
the requirement for informed consent. This manuscript has been 
prepared in accordance with the STROBE guidelines.14
2.2  |  Setting and participants
Patients were included if they underwent single-­stage PSIF with 
or without traction for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis corrective 
surgery at BC Children's Hospital, a tertiary care academic pediatric 
facility. The study period spanned January 2012 to April 2021. 
Eligibility criteria included American Society of Anaesthesiologists 
(ASA) status I–III, ages 10–19. Cases were excluded if surgery 
was more than a single-­stage procedure, if the surgical technique 
comprised of an anterior, thorascopic, or tethering approach, or if 
patients had a neuromuscular or congenital cause for scoliosis. All 
included patients received standard IONPM.
Charts were reviewed to distinguish cases with I-­IVLT admin-
istration from those without. I-­IVLT was given as a 1 mg/kg bolus 
followed by and infusion of 2 mg/kg/h. until the end of the surgical 
procedure; this I-­IVLT regimen has been applied consistently across 
the study period.
2.3  |  IONPM procedures
IONPM was performed using current practice standards and or-
ganizational protocols, by experienced technologists certified in 
Neurophysiological Intraoperative Monitoring (Appendix  A). The 
monitoring device changed from the Cascade PRO, used 2012–2019, 
to the Cascade IOMAX, used 2019–2021 (Cadwell Industries Inc., 
Kennewick, WA), but there were no changes in the monitoring proto-
col or the parameters used for event reporting during the study period.

2.4  |  Variables collected and data sources
For all patients included in this analysis, recorded demographic data 
included: ASA status, age, height, weight, sex, allergies, Lenke curve, 
Cobb angle, details of the surgical procedure (number of vertebral 
levels fused, number of vertebrectomies, presence of surgical 
duration of traction traction), and confirmation of I-­IVLT or not.
IONPM data included the amplitude and latency of the SSEP re-
sponses bilaterally from both the ulnar and post tibia evoked poten-
tials and the amplitudes of the MEPs, and were collected from the 
neurophysiological records. Baseline values for these measurements 
were taken after induction of anesthesia, and after commencement 
of the I-­IVLT if given, but prior to the start of surgery. The entire case 
was reviewed and neuromonitoring variables were sampled and re-
corded at approximately one hourly intervals at which the required 
data were available, and recorded as measured changes from these 
baseline values. The completeness of clinical neurophysiological 
data at other timepoints that were not required for the study was 
not evaluated.
For MEPs, bilateral adductor pollicis brevis and brachoradialis 
muscles were aggregated into upper limbs; and bilateral adductor 
hallucis and tibialis anterior muscles were aggregated into lower 
limbs. SSEP measurements were also reported as upper limbs (bilat-
eral ulnar nerves) and lower limbs (bilateral posterior tibial nerves). 
Reported outcomes include: MEP amplitude for lower limbs and 
upper limbs; SSEP amplitude for lower limbs and upper limbs; and 
SSEP latency for upper and lower limbs (Figure 1).
IONPM events were identified by reviewing neuromonitoring 
data for any changes that reached clinical alert criteria of a re-
duction in amplitude of ≥50% in MEPs or SSEPs, or an SSEP la-
tency increase of ≥10%. Factors associated with IONPM, such as 
mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), Bispectal index (BIS), tem-
perature, and heart rate were documented when available in the 
neurophysiological records, along with details of any additional 
medication boluses.
De-­identified data were recorded in a Research Education Data 
Capture (REDCap) database.15
2.5  |  Data analysis
2.5.1  |  Sample size
We had an available sample of 39 cases in which I-­IVLT had been 
used as part of the anesthetic regimen. We selected an additional 
sample of 42 cases, in which I-­IVLT had not been used by searching 
the neurophysiology database for eligible cases managed by 
anesthesiologists who do not incorporate I-­IVLT into their practice, 
starting at the end-­date of our study period and working backwards 
until we had an equal number of cases; we collected an additional 
three cases in case of missing data. All cases were selected before 
IONPM data were reviewed.
2.5.2  |  Statistical analysis and quantitative variables
Differences in age, sex, weight, Cobb angle, surgical duration, 
and number of vertebral levels fused between the group that re-
ceived I-­IVLT and the group that did not were evaluated based on 
a standardized mean difference calculated using Cohen's h for the 
binary variable (sex) and Cohen's d for the continuous variables. 
For hourly snapshot data, we used a linear mixed effects model, in-
cluding fixed effects for surgical time elapsed and administration of 
intraoperative lidocaine or not, with participant as a random effect. 
Data were compared between two groups: cases who received 
I-­IVLT versus cases who received no lidocaine infusion; between

group results are reported using mean difference (MD) and their 
95% confidence interval (CI). Hourly snapshot data are displayed 
in box plots. We also examined the effect of the elapsed surgical 
duration on MEP and SSEP measurements in terms of stabilizing 
or destabilizing effect (associated with a deviation from baseline 
as procedure time increases). In other words, whether increasing 
elapsed surgical time is associated with a deviation of or conformity 
to baseline values.
We compared the total number of reportable neurophysiological 
events using Fishers exact test and used a Kaplan–Meier survival 
curve and hazard ratios, estimated from a Cox proportional hazards 
model, to represent time to first reportable event in each group. 
Reportable events were operationalized in accordance with clinical 
alert criteria as a 10% increase in SSEP latency or a 50% decrease in 
SSEP or MEP amplitude.16
Exploratory noninferiority testing was also completed on hourly 
snapshot data using the above reportable event criteria of 10% 
for SSEP latency and 50% for SSEP or MEP amplitude as a clinical 
significance margin.17 All statistical analyses were conducted in R 
v4.3.0.18
3  |  RESULTS
3.1  |  Participants
Data were available from 81 cases conducted between 4 February 
2016 and 22 April 2021: 39 cases in the group who received I-­
IVLT and 42 cases in the group who received no lidocaine infusion; 
differences in demographic and procedure characteristics between 
groups were small (Table 1). All participants received propofol-­opioid 
total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). Baseline MAP was higher in the 
I-­IVLT group compared to the no lidocaine group (MD 6, 95% CI 0 to 
11; p = .044), but there were no differences between the groups in 
baseline MEP, SSEP, BIS or body temperature measurements and no 
differences between the groups in subsequent hourly intraoperative 
measurements for BIS, MAP, or body temperature throughout the 
surgery (Table 2).
3.2  |  Hourly neurophysiological monitoring
IONPM measurements of MEP amplitude and SSEP amplitude and 
latency for both upper and lower limbs were available for all par-
ticipants at baseline. We had a total of 385 hourly snapshot data 
points across all participants, with a median (interquartile range) of 
5.0 (4.0–5.5) hourly data points per participant in the I-­IVLT group 
and 5.0 (4.0–5.8) in the no lidocaine group. For each snapshot data 
point, we had full data for MEP (amplitude) and SSEP (amplitude and 
latency) and each limb.
Based on these hourly snapshot data, there was no clear evidence 
of I-­IVLT having an effect on MEP amplitudes in lower limbs (MD 41.9, 
95% CI −304.5 to 388.3; p = .182). In upper limbs, there was some 
evidence for a large difference favoring the use of intraoperative lido-
caine (MD −279.0, 95% CI −562.5 to 4.4; p = .054) (Figure 2).
There was also no evidence of an effect of lidocaine on SSEP 
amplitudes between the two groups. Specifically, the linear mixed-­
effects model indicated no impact of I-­IVLT on SSEP amplitudes 
in the lower limbs (MD 16.4, 95% CI [−17.7, 50.5]; p = .345) or in 
the upper limbs (MD −2.4, 95% CI [−14.5, 9.8]; p = .701) (Figure 3). 
Similarly, there was no evidence of a difference in SSEP latencies 
between groups in either lower limbs (MD 1.21, 95% CI [−1.29, 3.70]; 
p = .343) or upper limbs (MD 0.35, 95% CI [−1.82, 2.51]; p = .754) 
(Figure 3).
The amount of surgical time elapsed had an impact on the 
change from baseline of some IONPM measures, which was modi-
fied by the use of I-­IVLT. There was an interaction between surgical 
time elapsed and I-­IVLT use in upper limb MEP amplitude on change 
from baseline (p = .047). In those without lidocaine, increasing surgi-
cal time led to an average decrease of −31.31 (95% CI [−62.15, 0.49]) 
from baseline for each unit increase in time. In those with lidocaine 
infusion therapy, there was a positive association between time 
and a change from baseline of 8.82 (95% CI [−22.29, 39.91]), sug-
gesting lidocaine may have a stabilizing effect on the MEP changes 
from baseline as the surgery progresses compared to no lidocaine. 
There was no evidence that surgical time elapsed had an effect on 
lower limb MEP amplitudes (p = .980) or lower limb SSEP amplitude 
(p = .249).

There was also an interaction effect of I-­IVLT and surgical time 
elapsed in upper SSEP amplitude (p < .001). In participants without I-­
IVLT, a small decrease of −3.13 (95% CI [−4.81, −1.46]) from baseline 
was associated with each unit increase in time. In those with I-­IVLT, a 
similar decrease of −3.16 (95% CI [−4.85, −1.47]) was associated with 
increasing surgical time elapsed.
This interaction effect was mirrored in SSEP latency in both 
lower (p < .001) and upper (p = .043) limbs. In lower limbs, a slightly 
larger decrease from baseline of −0.907 (95% CI [−1.27, −0.556]) was 
associated with a one unit increase in time in those without lido-
caine, while those with lidocaine had a smaller decrease of −0.653 
(95% CI [−1.01, −0.30]) per increasing unit of time.

3.3  |  Reportable neurophysiological events
One or more reportable IONPM events occurred in 43/81 (53%) 
participants. There was no difference between I-­IVLT versus no lido-
caine cases in the number of cases with reportable events (27 events 
occurred in 22/39 [56%] I-­IVLT cases versus 32 events in 21/42 [50%] 
no lidocaine cases; RR = 0.87, 95% CI [0.55, 1.39], p = .66), or in the 
time to first reportable event (hazard ratio = 1.13, 95% CI [0.61, 2.09]; 
p = .68) (Figure 4). Median time to first event was 2.6 h (95% CI 2.2 to 
4.0) for the I-­IVLT group and 2.5 h (95% CI 1.4 to 4.7) for the no lido-
caine group. For each event, one or more actions were taken, which 
included: repositioning of the arms (n = 6), adjusting anesthesia medi-
cation with the aim of increased MAP or reduced depth of anesthe-
sia (n = 27), taking traction off (n = 8), increasing stimulation current 
(n = 23), using multiple stimulations (n = 10), and reversing surgical 
manipulation (n = 4); recovery was spontaneous in 13 cases. The num-
bers of times these actions were used were similar between I-­IVLT 
and no lidocaine cases. Incomplete recovery of responses before end 
of surgery was noted in two I-­IVLT cases and two no lidocaine cases.
3.4  |  Exploratory noninferiority testing
The noninferiority of lidocaine was demonstrated in SSEP latency in 
both lower (MD 2.1, lower bound = 1.25; p < .001) and upper limbs 
(MD −0.86, lower bound = −1.58; p < .001) using a non-­inferiority 
margin of −10. Non-­inferiority was also demonstrated in SSEP ampli-
tude in both lower (MD 9.77, 95% CI, lower bound = −3.98; p < .001) 
and upper limbs (MD −0.59, lower bound = −5.83; p < .001) using a 
non-­inferiority margin of −50. In MEP data, noninferiority was dem-
onstrated using the same margin in lower limbs (MD 130.6, lower 
bound =16.91; p = .005), but not in the upper limbs (MD 127.1, lower 
bound = −195; p = .969).
4  |  DISCUSSION
In this single-­centre, retrospective study, we observed a minimal im-
pact of I-­IVLT on IONPM during PSIF in adolescents with idiopathic 
scoliosis. We found no evidence of any detrimental impact of I-­IVLT 
on MEP amplitude, SSEP amplitudes, or SSEP latencies, using sam-
ples of change from baseline in IONPM measurements collected at 
hourly intervals from upper and lower limbs. Similarly, we found no 
difference in the number of reportable neurophysiological events or 
in the time to first event.
The feasibility of I-­IVLT during PSIF procedures requires that it 
has minimal impact on IONPM. The spine team depend on reliable 
IONPM during surgery to monitor the integrity of the spinal cord and 
make timely adjustments, if necessary. This contributes to improved 
patient safety and promotes successful outcomes. Lidocaine, ad-
ministered intravenously, acts at multiple receptors, with analgesic, 
anti-­inflammatory, and antihyperalgesic properties.5,19 The analge-
sic properties are partly attributed to blockade of sodium channel 
nerve fibers and inhibition of the polysynaptic reflex induced by 
C-­fibers and Aδ fibers.20 Two clinical trials have found that intraop-
erative lidocaine infusion therapy has led to decreased hospital stay, 
decreased rescue analgesia requirements, decreased cortisol levels, 
and earlier return of bowel function following abdominal surgery21 
and spinal surgery;7 similarly, reduced postoperative opioid require-
ments were reported in a retrospective observational study of ado-
lescent patients undergoing scoliosis correction surgery.6
Our results extend the findings of an adult study of 129 spinal 
correction cases, which demonstrated that propofol-­opioid TIVA 
with intraoperative lidocaine at a rate of 1.5 mg/kg/h had no effect 
on cortical SSEP or MEP amplitudes following median and poste-
rior tibial nerve stimulation, nor any significant differences in MEP 
stimulation voltages.22 A similar study in adults undergoing spinal 
correction surgery found no significant within-­patient differences

between MEP threshold voltages or SSEP amplitudes with intraop-
erative lidocaine infusion at a rate of 1.0 mg/kg/h following a 10-­
min bolus dose of 1.0 mg/kg.23 Propofol-­opioid TIVA was utilized 
in both studies; however, both analyses used threshold-­voltage 
methodology and did not report on variability or alert criteria. 
Neuromonitoring methodology differences limit the possible com-
parison to our patient cohort.
A 40-­patient randomized controlled trial investigating the ef-
fects of low-­dose lidocaine (1 mg/kg bolus followed by 1 mg/kg/h 
infusion) in patients undergoing intracranial tumor resection with 
propofol-­remifentanil anesthesia found no effect on MEP amplitude 
or latency, but did report improved hemodynamic stability, reduced 
propofol use, and decreased incidence of adverse events.24 We sim-
ilarly observed a negative interaction effect of the administration 
of lidocaine and surgical time elapsed in upper limb SSEP latency, 
suggesting that lidocaine administration may stabilize or reduces the 
negative impact of surgical time elapsed on the measured latency, 
which could indicate an improvement in IONPM measurement 
consistency. Further investigation is needed to establish robust evi-
dence for this effect.
On the other hand, our findings contrast those of Chaves-­Vischer 
et al. who found that a similar dosing regimen of 1 mg/kg lidocaine 
infusion decreased SSEP amplitude by 50% and increased latency 
by 5% in a case report of two adolescents undergoing scoliosis sur-
gery.13 The absence of precise dosing data in our analysis limits our 
ability to compare these results and both of Chaves-­Vischer's pa-
tients received a nitrous oxide-­fentanyl-­midazolam regimen, which 
is not comparable with our TIVA approach. Our results also contrast 
those of Schubert et al., where intraoperative lidocaine infusion in 
16 adolescents undergoing abdominal surgery resulted in a reduc-
tion in cortical SSEP amplitude by 25%–30% and a 5% increase in 
latency.12 Again, comparison with our results is restricted by differ-
ences in lidocaine dosing and anesthetic approach: Schubert et al., 
employed a 3 mg/kg bolus of lidocaine followed by a 4 mg/kg/h. in-
fusion, compared to our lower bolus dose of 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg/h.

anesthetic. Future prospective study is needed to address these dis-
crepancies to determine dose response effects of lidocaine infusion 
therapy and its interaction with the chosen anesthetic regimen.
We also observed a significant negative effect of surgical time 
elapsed in both upper and lower limbs in MEP amplitude and SSEP 
amplitude and latency. This finding is consistent with previous 
studies indicating an increased likelihood of neurophysiological 
events with increasing surgical time elapsed during spinal corrective 
surgery.25
4.1  |  Limitations
We had relatively small numbers in each group for the power to de-
tect differences, which is reflected in some of our wide CIs. While 
we found no evidence that I-­IVLT had any detrimental effect on 
IONPM outcomes, we must be cautious in generalizing these find-
ings from this sample. Matching on patient risk factors such as sex, 
age, Cobb angle, procedure details, surgical duration (±1 h), and sur-
geon may have improved this precision but was not feasible in our 
sample. Prospective study is required to establish the validity and 
reliability of our finding.
Clinical neurophysiological parameters' recording standards 
have evolved over time, leading to variability among technologists 
in the content of the IONPM files we analyzed. Some potentially 
impactful data points were recorded inconsistently across cases. 
Therefore, future investigations should incorporate a standardized 
variable proforma for comprehensive data collection.
Our study did not have a standardized anesthetic regime as this 
was a retrospective study. Presently, our institution employs a TIVA 
approach, typically comprising propofol and sufentanil, with or with-
out adjunctive agents including ketamine or lidocaine. We did not 
collect specific drug doses or exact timing of administration in this 
retrospective study; these details should be available in a future pro-
spective study. However, for the cases in which I-­IVLT was used, we 
know that it was maintained at standardized doses (1 mg/kg bolus 
followed by 2 mg/kg/h until end of surgery). This dose regime has 
previously been shown to achieve clinically effective and safe blood 
levels (<3 μg/mL) in healthy patients.26
It is important to note that many of our statistical analyses had 
wide CIs, illustrating a high degree of uncertainty in our data. While 
we can draw tentative conclusions about the safety of I-­IVLT, this 
motivates the need for a more robust, prospective trial.
4.2  |  Conclusion
Our findings suggest that intraoperative intravenous lidocaine in-
fusion therapy has no detrimental effect on IONPM in adolescents 
undergoing PSIF for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. A future pro-
spective randomized study is required to provide a more detailed 
and reliable analysis by controlling for the limitations outlined in this 
analysis.

APPENDIX A
Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring during posterior spinal 
instrumentation and fusion surgery at BC Children's Hospital
The somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor evoked po-
tentials (MEPs) of the upper and lower limbs were monitored with the 
Cadwell Cascade PRO (2012–2019) or Cascade IOMAX (2019–2021) 
neurophysiological monitoring system (Cadwell Laboratories Inc, WA).
Following anesthesia induction, monitoring and stimulation 
electrodes were placed on the scalp in accordance with the in-
ternational 10–20 system27,28 using subcutaneous corkscrew elec-
trodes. Subcutaneous needle electrodes were used to monitor the 
muscle potentials placed bilaterally in the adductor hallucis (AH), 
tibialis anterior (TA), brachioradialis (BR), and adductor pollicis 
brevis (APB), with stimulation electrodes in the M1-­M2, M3 and 
M4 positions. Stimulation was delivered by constant current elec-
trical stimulator using multiple pulses (1–6) with voltage starting at 
150 V and gradually increasing at 50V intervals as needed with a 
pulse duration of 50–75 μs, ranging from 150 to 800 V.
Conductive gel electrodes, used to stimulate the SSEP responses 
for the upper limbs, were placed on both wrists to stimulate the ulnar 
nerves. Responses were recorded from electrodes C3′, C4′ (2 cm be-
hind C3 and C4 respectively) and a reference electrode placed at FZ. 
Stimulation electrodes for the lower limbs were placed on both an-
kles to stimulate the posterior tibial nerve, with responses recorded

usually from Cz′. The derivations deemed the most stable was cho-
sen for monitoring the case.29 The stimulation for the SSEP used a 
frequency of 2.1-­4.7 Hz, with an intensity between 20 and 50 mA.
During the operative procedure, reliable data for the measure-
ment of spinal cord function was recorded in the form of amplitudes 
and latencies of the SSEP and MEP. Initial recordings were taken 
once the patient was on stable intravenous anesthesia. Stimulus in-
tensities were altered in relation to the alert criteria set as a 50% 
drop in amplitude of the MEP and a 50% drop in amplitude or a 10% 
increase in latency in two or more derivations of the SSEP. There was 
no exceeding the following stimulation: >50 mA for the SSEP and 
800 single train and 500 V double train stimulation.
