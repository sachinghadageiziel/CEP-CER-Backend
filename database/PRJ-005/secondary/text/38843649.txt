Purpose: Desflurane is a widely used volatile anesthetic with multiple clinical advantages, but comprehensive pharmacovigilance analyses 
are needed to optimize its safety profile. This study aimed to analyze and classify adverse events(AEs) associated with desflurane in the Food 
and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System(FAERS) database and evaluate potential safety signals.
Patients and Methods: We analyzed FAERS reports from 2004Q1 to 2025Q1 where desflurane was the primary suspect(PS) drug. Cases 
were classified using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA27.1) terminology and processed following FDA- 
recommended deduplication strategy. Four disproportionality analyses were conducted: Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional 
Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS).
Results: Among 1,191 cases, bradycardia was most frequent (n = 39; ROR = 38.72, 95% CI 28.14–53.28) with 79.4% classified as 
serious. Notable findings included anaphylactic shock (n = 23; 69.6% serious), bronchospasm (n = 22), and malignant hyperthermia­
(MH) (n = 20; 25% mortality). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 2) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 
(n = 2) were documented - a previously unreported association with desflurane exposure.
Conclusion: Our analysis reveals clinically significant safety signals associated with desflurane, including cardiovascular, anaphy­
lactic, and respiratory complications that may require enhanced perioperative monitoring. The study underscores the critical 
importance of sustained post-marketing surveillance for detecting rare but serious safety signals, not typically evident in pre- 
approval clinical trials.

Introduction
As the cornerstone of modern surgical practice, general anesthesia enables safe and painless performance of complex 
invasive procedures. Desflurane mediates its antinociceptive action primarily by inducing general anesthesia and 
unconsciousness, thereby abolishing nociceptive awareness. Research demonstrates desflurane’s capacity to reduce 
pain signal propagation via inhibition of spinal cord dorsal horn neurons.1
Among volatile anesthetics, desflurane has emerged as particularly valuable in neurosurgical2,3 and cardiac 
procedures,4 owing to its low blood-gas partition coefficient and stable hemodynamic profile - properties that facilitate 
precise anesthetic depth control. However, its clinical application remains controversial due to its pungent odor and 
airway irritability, which frequently induce coughing, breath holding, and laryngospasm5 during induction, particularly in 
pediatric and non-intubated patients.6 Comparative studies have demonstrated a higher incidence of postoperative nausea 
and vomiting (PONV) with desflurane than with propofol or sevoflurane.3,7 Like other volatile anesthetics, desflurane

may trigger malignant hyperthermia in susceptible individuals,8 while preclinical investigations have raised concerns 
about potential neurotoxic effects in the developing brain.9
Despite these documented concerns, the existing literature is fragmented, based primarily on controlled trials with 
limited sample sizes or isolated case reports. This highlights a significant gap in comprehensive evaluations of 
desflurane’s safety profile in real-world clinical practice.
FAERS is a critical pharmacovigilance resource that aggregates post-marketing adverse event reports submitted by 
healthcare professionals, patients, and manufacturers. Prior studies have demonstrated its value in detecting potential 
drug safety issues,10 such as the identification of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and DIC as safety signals associated with 
sugammadex,11 or the elevated risks of propofol administration in epileptic patients.12 These findings have provided 
crucial guidance for perioperative medication decisions. It is important to acknowledge the inherent limitations of the 
FAERS database, which lacks critical patient-specific details such as pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variables 
(genetic polymorphisms, organ function) and formulation characteristics (excipients). These factors may influence the 
incidence and severity of reported adverse events. The value of this analysis lies in identifying potential safety signals for 
further investigation once more detailed clinical information becomes available.
Given substantial gaps in knowledge regarding desflurane’s safety profile, real-world evidence from pharmacovigi­
lance databases offers essential insights by aggregating spontaneous adverse event reports across diverse populations. 
Such data are particularly valuable for detecting rare complications that may not manifest in controlled trials.13
This study leverages the FAERS database to systematically investigate three key aspects: (1) the population 
distribution of desflurane-associated AEs; (2) the system organ class classification of these events; and (3) the demo­
graphic characteristics of patients experiencing severe AEs. Our findings aim to inform evidence-based anesthetic 
practice and enhance regulatory oversight.

Materials and Methods
Data Collection
We analyzed reports from the FAERS database spanning Q1 2004 to Q1 2025. The database contains seven structured 
files, including demographic information (DEMO), drug exposure details (DRUG), reported adverse events (REAC), 
indications for use (INDI), therapy dates (THER), patient outcomes (OUTC), and report sources (RPSR).
Signal Detection and Processing
Duplicate reports were removed using FDA-recommended deduplication based on CASE ID and FDA receipt date (FDA 
DT), with exclusion of reports containing missing or inconsistent critical fields. Adverse events were coded using 
MedDRA version 27.1 Preferred Terms, and desflurane cases were identified using both generic (“DESFLURANE”) and 
brand (“SUPRANE”) names, retaining only primary suspect cases.
Statistical Analysis
Four disproportionality analysis methods were employed: ROR (threshold: ROR ≥3 with 95% CI lower limit >1), PRR 
(thresholds: PRR ≥2, χ² ≥4, and ≥3 cases), BCPNN (thresholds: IC025 >0), and MGPS (thresholds: EBGM05 >2). 
Detailed methodology is provided in Table 1.
Statistical analyses examined demographic characteristics (age, sex, reporter type), clinical outcomes (hospitalization, 
life-threatening events, death), AEs frequency by occurrence and System Organ Class(SOC), and signal concordance 
through Venn diagram analysis of serious/rare AEs identified by all four methods. All analyses were conducted using 
R software (v4.5.0).
Results
Data Processing Results
A total of 22,775,812 DEMO records were extracted from the FAERS database. After applying FDA-recommended 
deduplication criteria, 3,749,303 records were excluded, yielding 19,026,509 unique entries. Using MedDRA for AEs 
mapping, 56,998,621 REAC records were obtained. By setting “DESFLURANE” and “SUPRANE” as preferred terms 
(PS), 511 DRUG records and 1,191 REAC records were identified. The data screening and analysis flowchart is 
illustrated in Figure 1.

Demographic Baseline Characteristics
Among patients experiencing AEs associated with desflurane, 200 (39.2%) were female, 181 (35.5%) were male, and 129 
(25.3%) had no gender specification in the FAERS database. Regarding weight distribution, 21 (4.1%) patients weighed 
<50 kg, 9 (1.8%) weighed >100 kg, and 125 (24.5%) fell within the 50–100 kg range, while the majority (69.6%) lacked 
weight documentation. Age-wise, adults aged 18–64.9 years (38.0%) exhibited the highest incidence of AEs, whereas elderly 
patients (>85 years) accounted for only 1%. These findings suggest that caution remains warranted when administering this 
inhalational anesthetic to adult populations. Serious AEs were reported in 303 cases (59.4%), including 18 fatalities (3.5%). 
Among reporters, health professionals (27, 5.3%), pharmacists (28, 5.5%), and physicians (235, 46.1%) constituted the 
primary sources, underscoring the reliability of these AE reports. Detailed demographic data are presented in Table 2.
Distribution of Adverse Events
Analysis of 1,191 AE reports revealed the most frequent AEs (Figure 2): bradycardia (n=39), post-procedural complica­
tion (n=32), cardiac arrest (n=25), anaphylactic shock (n=23), hypotension (n=22), bronchospasm (n=22), malignant 
hyperthermia (n=20), unwanted awareness during anesthesia (n=19), fetal exposure during pregnancy (n=19), and 
tachycardia (n=16). Stratified by System Organ Class (SOC) (Figure 3), the highest AE frequencies were observed in: 
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (n=180), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (n=144), 
Cardiac disorders (n=138), Investigations (n=114), Nervous system disorders (n=87), General disorders and administra­
tion site conditions (n=81), Hepatobiliary disorders (n=62), Vascular disorders (n=58), Eye disorders (n=47), and 
Immune system disorders (n=36).

Signal Detection Analysis
Using four disproportionality algorithms (ROR, PRR, BCPNN, MGPS), statistically significant safety signals were 
identified as follows: ROR (n=94), PRR (n=95), BCPNN (n=96), and MGPS (n=119). Venn diagram analysis yielded 85 
safety signals common to all four methods (Figure 4). These safety signals spanned multiple organ systems, including 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, Hepatobiliary disorders, Renal and urinary disorders, Nervous system 
disorders, Cardiac disorders, and Vascular disorders, with critical involvement of Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
and Immune system disorders(Supplementary Table 1).
Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: Bronchospasm (n=22) and laryngospasm (n=10) were the most 
prevalent safety signals, exhibiting high signal strengths with ROR (95% CI) of 80.23 (52.6–122.36) and 190.45 
(102.08–355.32), respectively. These severe events may acutely impair pulmonary ventilation, leading to sustained 
hypoxemia and, if unmanaged, respiratory failure.

Hepatobiliary and renal disorders: Hepatitis (n=11), hepatotoxicity (n=8), hepatic failure (n=6), anuria (n=3), and oliguria 
(n=3) were flagged as significant signals, with ROR (95% CI) values of 22.59 (12.47–40.91), 19.28 (9.62–38.66), 10.29 
(4.61–22.95), 17.66 (5.69–54.86), and 24.88 (8.01–77.27), respectively.
Nervous system disorders (7.3% of total safety signals): Epilepsy (n=2), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (n=3), 
altered consciousness (n=3), brain edema (n=3), seizure-like phenomena (n=3), encephalopathy (n=3), intracranial 
hypertension (n=3), and hepatic encephalopathy (n=3) were detected as signals.
Cardiac and vascular disorders: Bradycardia (n=39), cardiac arrest (n=25), tachycardia (n=16), torsade de pointes 
(n=6), hypotension (n=22), shock (n=5), circulatory collapse (n=3), and blood pressure fluctuations (n=3) were identified 
as significant safety signals.
Life-threatening safety signals: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (n=3), anaphylactic shock (n=23), and 
anaphylactic reaction (n=8) also demonstrated strong signal associations.
Mortality Cases Associated with Malignant Hyperthermia
Among the five fatal cases attributed to malignant hyperthermia (Table 3), all patients were aged 18–65 years, with two 
cases reporting body weights within the 50–100 kg range. The cohort comprised three females and two males. Regarding 
administration, four cases explicitly documented inhalation as the route of delivery, with one specifying a concentration 
of 5 VOL% and another reporting a flow rate of 1 L/min.

Subgroup Analysis: Severe vs Non-Severe Cases
To further delineate the clinical implications of reported safety signals, cases were stratified into severe and non-severe 
subgroups (Figure 5). Notably, bradycardia (31 severe vs 8 non-severe cases, 79.4%), delayed recovery from anesthesia 
(6 vs 2, 75%), and device-related issues (6 vs 1, 85.7%) exhibited a higher propensity for severe outcomes, corroborated 
by elevated ROR values. These findings underscore the necessity of vigilant intraoperative heart rate monitoring to 
mitigate bradycardia-related complications, as well as heightened postoperative vigilance for delayed emergence. 
Additionally, preoperative equipment checks are imperative, given the potential for device failures to precipitate life- 
threatening events. In contrast, fetal exposure during pregnancy (2 severe vs 7 non-severe cases, 22.2%) demonstrated 
a lower association with severe outcomes; however, the limited sample size precludes definitive conclusions, warranting 
further investigation into the safety of desflurane in obstetric anesthesia.

Discussion
The evolution of anesthetic agents has revolutionized surgical outcomes, significantly reducing mortality and morbidity 
associated with intraoperative pain and stress responses.14 Desflurane is a widely used volatile anesthetic with several 
pharmacological advantages, including rapid induction, low blood-gas solubility, and minimal metabolism, making it 
particularly suitable for surgical procedures requiring precise anesthetic control.3,15 Its rapid washout renders it especially 
useful in ambulatory and neurosurgical settings,16 where prompt postoperative extubation17 and efficient operating room 
turnover18 are critical.
However, despite these benefits, desflurane is associated with dose-dependent AEs. Feyzullah et al19 demonstrated 
through acoustic voice analysis that desflurane anesthesia may cause clinically subtle vocal deterioration. Other reported 
AEs include airway irritation, hemodynamic instability, and rare but life-threatening complications such as MH.20 Given 
its widespread clinical use, systematic pharmacovigilance is essential to identify and mitigate these risks. FAERS 
provides a valuable real-world dataset for evaluating desflurane’s safety profile beyond controlled clinical trials.
Our analysis of FAERS reports from Q1 2004 to Q1 2025 identified significant AEs associated with desflurane, 
including bradycardia, anaphylactic shock, bronchospasm, MH, and DIC. These findings underscore the need for 
enhanced perioperative monitoring and updated safety protocols to minimize patient harm.
Cardiovascular Adverse Events: Bradycardia as the Most Common Complication
Our study revealed bradycardia as the most frequently reported AEs (n=39), with 79.4% of cases classified as severe, 
potentially leading to life-threatening events or prolonged hospitalization. This aligns with prior research21 indicating that 
desflurane induces transient sympathetic activation followed by parasympathetic dominance, resulting in sinus bradycardia. 
Direct myocardial depression22 and baroreflex modulation may further contribute to this effect. Pediatric and elderly patients, 
due to reduced autonomic reserve, are at higher risk.23 Continuous ECG monitoring is therefore imperative, particularly in 
high-risk populations,24,25 and atropine should be readily available to manage severe bradycardia.
Anaphylactic Shock: A Severe and Concerning Reaction
FAERS documented 23 cases of anaphylactic shock, 69.6% of which were severe and required emergency intervention.26 This 
rapid-onset, potentially fatal reaction is often misattributed to other intraoperative events. IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to 
fluorinated anesthetics has been previously reported,27 warranting preoperative allergy screening in patients with a history of 
drug reactions.28 Immediate administration of epinephrine and corticosteroids is critical if anaphylaxis is suspected.26,29
Neurological Adverse Events: Rare but Clinically Significant
Although neurological AEs were uncommon (7.3%), two cases of seizures were reported. A systematic review 
(2003–2020)16 suggested minimal AEs when desflurane was used for anesthesia maintenance in supratentorial brain 
tumor surgeries. However, Wang et al9 found that desflurane-based anesthesia comparably affected postoperative sleep 
quality to propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia. Thus, caution is advised in epileptic patients, and intraoperative 
stereotactic EEG (SEEG) or subdural EEG (SDE) monitoring may be beneficial.30
Respiratory Complications: Bronchospasm and Laryngospasm
Bronchospasm (n=22) and laryngospasm (n=10) were the most frequent respiratory AEs, consistent with desflurane’s 
known airway-irritating properties. Notably, two cases of ARDS were identified—a complication not previously 
documented in desflurane’s labeling. Direct tracheobronchial irritation may trigger reflexive bronchoconstriction, while 
inflammatory cytokine release could contribute to ARDS. Further evaluation is needed for patients with asthma or 
reactive airway disease.
Life-Threatening Complications: Malignant Hyperthermia and DIC
Twenty MH cases were reported, including five fatalities, aligning with label warnings. Dantrolene must be immediately 
available when using desflurane, and vigilant temperature monitoring is essential for early intervention. Additionally,

DIC (n=3, two fatal) was identified as a previously unreported AE. Characterized by systemic thrombosis and bleeding 
diathesis, DIC may progress to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS),31 shock, or death.32 Murine models using 
KCG and LPS33 may aid in elucidating its pathogenesis. Unexplained intraoperative bleeding should prompt urgent 
coagulation testing.
Limitations
Despite its utility in post-marketing surveillance, the FAERS database presents several limitations relevant to our 
assessment of desflurane-associated adverse events: First, substantial underreporting and reporting bias exist, particularly 
for common anesthetic complications (eg, postoperative nausea) compared to rare but dramatic events (eg, malignant 
hyperthermia).34 Second, critical clinical details - including exact dosing regimens, temporal relationships, and complete 
patient histories - are frequently missing from spontaneous reports.35 Third, the potential confounding effects of 
concomitant anesthetic medications (eg, opioids, neuromuscular blocking agents) cannot be reliably assessed due to 
the system’s passive surveillance nature.
Conclusion
Our analysis of FAERS data (2004–2025) identified significant desflurane-associated AEs, with bradycardia showing 
a high propensity to progress to severe outcomes without prompt intervention. Statistically robust signals (eg, anaphy­
lactic shock, bronchospasm, and malignant hyperthermia [MH]) underscore the need for enhanced intraoperative 
monitoring. Rare but life-threatening events, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC; n=3) - a finding 
not currently reflected in the drug’s labeling - were identified. These findings warrant updates to anesthesia practice 
guidelines and highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying these safety signals.
