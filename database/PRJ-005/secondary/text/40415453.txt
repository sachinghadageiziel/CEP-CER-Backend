ABSTRACT
Introduction: Primary aim was to assess the agreement between end‐tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) monitoring and arterial,
capillary and venous PCO2 values in mechanically ventilated patients receiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH) for hypoxic‐
ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Secondary, to assess the percentage of time spent in predefined PCO2 ranges based on
continuous etCO2 monitoring.
Methods: In this prospective observational single center trial, infants with moderate‐to‐severe HIE receiving conventional
ventilation with sidestream capnography were enrolled. Blood gas measurements were performed based on clinical indication.
The mean of 12,000 etCO2 values obtained over 10 min before each corresponding blood gas was used for analysis. The
agreement between mean etCO2 and temperature corrected and uncorrected PCO2 at 37◦C were analyzed using Bland‐Altman
(BA) plots.
Results: A total of 262 paired PCO2 and etCO2 values were analyzed from 35 patients. The bias between temperature corrected
arterial PCO2 and etCO2 (n = 116) was 1.87 mmHg (SD 5.54) with −8.99 and 12.73 limits of agreement; whereas the bias
between capillary PCO2 and etCO2 (n = 132) was 7.22 mmHg (SD 6.08). EtCO2 underestimated PCO2 of any source at 37°C.
Excluding patients with lung diseases from BA analysis did not show improvement in the agreement. Infants spent median
23.9% [IQR 8.5; 36.7] of monitoring time in etCO2 range < 35 mmHg and median 75.0% [IQR 61.1; 87.7] in etCO2 range of
35‐55 mmHg.
Conclusions: EtCO2 monitoring may be a valuable addition to neurocritical care of infants with HIE as it showed a strong level
of agreement with temperature corrected arterial PCO2.

Introduction
To date only therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has been proven to
reduce the risk of death and unfavorable neurological outcomes
in infants with moderate‐severe hypoxic‐ischemic encephalo-
pathy (HIE), which is one of the leading causes of neonatal
morbidity and mortality, affecting approximately 1–4 cases in
1000 live births in high‐resource settings [1, 2].

Despite the effective treatment, nearly 30‐50% of the infants
with moderate‐to‐severe HIE either die, or suffer from long‐
term motor and/or cognitive disabilities [3, 4] Over the last
decades several pharmacological agents such as melatonin or
erythropoietin have been tested but failed to show additional
neuroprotective effects when combined with TH for the treat-
ment of HIE [4]. Therefore, the optimization of intensive care
including respiratory support can play a defining role to
improve the long‐term neurological outcomes [5, 6].
Secondary analysis of the CoolCap and NICHD (National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development) random-
ized controlled trials for TH [7, 8] and multiple retrospective
cohort studies [9–13] demonstrated the association between
ventilation and oxygenation and neurodevelopmental outcomes
in infants with HIE. Both hyperoxia and hypocapnia have been
shown to be detrimental to the already injured brain [8–12].
Even a brief period of hyperoxia can trigger oxidative stress
leading to secondary injury after hypoxia‐ischemia [14]. Hypo-
capnia may worsen brain injury via multiple mechanisms
including hypoperfusion via cerebral vasoconstriction, pro‐
inflammatory response, and increased neuronal excitability
that may trigger seizure activity further increasing oxygen
demand [15–17].
Since there has been a consistent association between hypo-
capnia and adverse long‐term neurodevelopmental outcome,
close monitoring of CO2 levels should be encouraged. The gold
standard arterial blood gas sampling (PaCO2) does not allow
continuous monitoring of PCO2 and may result in unnecessary
blood loss [18]. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (tcPCO2) mon-
itoring during therapeutic hypothermia was tested in small‐
scale retrospective studies demonstrating from modest to poor
agreement between PaCO2 and tcPCO2 [19, 20]. Prospective
evaluation of the feasibility of tcPCO2 under TH is currently
underway (NCT04603547). End‐tidal CO2 (etCO2) monitoring
with microstream sampling technique resulting in minimal
instrumental dead space is a feasible option to continuously
monitor CO2 exchange.
A good agreement was demonstrated between PaCO2 and
etCO2 in mechanically ventilated infants from a heterogeneous
population, including both term and preterm infants, using
both side, ‐ and mainstream capnography [18, 21, 22]. A recent
retrospective chart review of 58 mechanically ventilated pa-
tients under TH showed a reliable correlation between tem-
perature corrected PaCO2 and etCO2 [23]. Notably, this
retrospective study is the only one to date that has evaluated the
agreement between etCO2 and PCO2 specifically in HIE
patients.
The primary aim of this prospective observational study was to
evaluate the agreement between etCO2 and arterial, capillary
and venous PCO2 values in mechanically ventilated patients
with HIE receiving TH. Secondary aim was to assess the per-
centage of time spent in predefined PCO2 ranges based on the
continuous etCO2 monitoring. We hypothesized that etCO2
would have a clinically acceptable agreement with the gold‐
standard arterial PCO2. Additionally, we expected that contin-
uous etCO2 monitoring would reveal that patients spend a
substantial proportion of time outside the predefined optimal
PCO2 ranges, highlighting the potential value of real‐time CO2
monitoring.

Patient Selection
In this prospective observational single center trial, we enrolled
infants born between 2020 December and 2022 March, treated
with therapeutic hypothermia for moderate‐to‐severe HIE ac-
cording to the criteria of the international TOBY trial (Total
Body Hypothermia for Neonatal Encephalopathy Trial) [24] at
the Division of Neonatology, Pediatric Center, Semmelweis
University. Ethical permission for data collection and analysis
was obtained from the Scientific and Medical Research Council
Ethics Committee of Hungary (IV/6161‐1/2020/EKU). Consent
was waived as the study involved no additional interventions
beyond standard care and relied on deidentified data.
From this patient pool, we included all infants receiving con-
ventional mechanical ventilation with sidestream capnography
monitoring. Continuous etCO2 data was linked to time‐
corresponding blood gas PCO2 levels. Exclusion criteria were
(a) major birth defects, (b) patients on palliative care, (c) res-
piratory morbidities treated with high‐frequency oscillatory
ventilation (HFOV) and/or inhaled nitric‐oxide therapy as an
indicator of severe persistent pulmonary hypertension.
Thompson encephalopathy score was utilized to assess the
severity of HIE. Systematic evaluation of brain magnetic reso-
nance images (MRI) was carried out using the scoring system
published by Weeke et al. [25] Bayley Scales of Infant Devel-
opment 2nd and 3rd Editions (Bayley‐2 and Bayley‐3, respec-
tively) was performed at 18–22 months of age by trained
examiners to evaluate neurodevelopmental outcome [26, 27].
Adverse neurodevelopmental outcome was defined as a score of
< 70 on either the Mental Development Index (MDI) or the
Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) in case of application of
the Bayley‐2 test, and < 85 on the Cognitive Language Com-
posite scale (CLC) or the Motor Composite scale (MC) of
Bayley‐3 test. Neurodevelopmental impairment cutoff values
were defined based on the recommendations of Jary et al. [28].

End Tidal CO2 Data Retrieval and Blood Gas
PCO2 Measurements
Neonates receiving TH were sedated (10 μg/kg/h continuous
morphine infusion) and mechanically ventilated as per local
protocol during the observational trial period. The etCO2 level
was monitored via Capnostream 35 portable respiratory moni-
tor (Medtronic Plc, Minneapolis, MN, USA), using sidestream
end
tidal
capnography
with
microstream
sampling
line
(FilterLine® H Set CO2 Sampling Line, Covidien, Medtronic)
during hypothermia and rewarming. EtCO2 monitoring was
recommended if available during TH as per unit policy. EtCO2
were registered and downloaded at a 20/s sampling rate.
Blood gas PCO2 levels were measured from arterial, capillary
and venous blood samples collected as part of routine care,
2 of 8

based on decisions of the attending physicians. Physicians were
not blinded for the etCO2 measurements. Blood gas measure-
ments were done on a GEM Premier 3500 (Werfen, Barcelona,
Spain) point of care blood gas system. PCO2 levels were cor-
rected for rectal temperature measured at the time of sample
collection. The blood gas system generates both temperature‐
corrected PCO2 values based on the entered rectal temperature,
and uncorrected PCO2 values, standardized to 37°C.
For every blood gas measurement, a corresponding time‐
matched etCO2 values were linked using the following method:
to create a representative etCO2 value, we calculated the mean
of 12,000 etCO2 readings obtained over a 10 min period, starting
12 min before and ending 2 min before each blood gas mea-
surement. We omitted the last 2 min before the gas analysis
because the blood had already been collected and placed in the
analyzer during this period. This approach was based on pre-
viously published data from Belteki et al. [29] Data points of
etCO2 were omitted before analysis if were < 20 mmHg or
> 100 mmHg due to limited accuracy in extreme ranges.

Outcomes
Primary outcome was the agreement between etCO2 and tem-
perature corrected and uncorrected PCO2 at 37 ◦C from arterial,
capillary and venous blood gas samples in infants with HIE
during TH. In a subgroup analysis, infants with respiratory
morbidities were excluded to assess the level of agreement in
infants without lung pathology. Respiratory morbidities were
defined
as
the
following:
meconium‐aspiration
syndrome
(MAS) or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) confirmed by
chest X‐ray and requiring surfactant replacement therapy or
pneumothorax (PTX) requiring chest tube insertion.
Secondary outcome was the time spent in predefined etCO2
ranges, namely hypocapnia (etCO2 < 35 mmHg), normocapnia
(35‐55 mmHg) and hypercapnia ( > 55 mmHg) in each patient.

Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables are reported as absolute numbers and
percentages, while continuous variables as median and 25th to
75th percentiles representing interquartile range [IQR].
Time stamped capnography measurements were downloaded
from the respiratory monitor as comma separated value (.csv)
text files. Blood gas measurements were entered manually into
a research database (iSORT, Semmelweis University). The
agreement between etCO2 and temperature corrected and
uncorrected PCO2 at 37◦C from arterial, capillary and venous
sources were analyzed. To assess agreement between the two
measurement methods, a Bland‐Altman (BA) analysis was
planned. Previously published data [23] indicated that a median
difference between arterial and end‐tidal PaCO2 was 3 units
with an interquartile range of 0 to 7, thus the standard deviation
of the differences was estimated at approximately 5.2. Assuming
a desired 95% confidence interval width of ±3 units for the
limits of agreement, the required minimum sample size was
calculated to be 35 subjects. We included multiple measure-
ments from each subject to account for possible within‐subject
variability. Average difference (bias), standard deviation (SD) of
the bias and 95% of limits of agreement were calculated.
The percentage of time spent in the predefined etCO2 ranges
was calculated by dividing the time spent within each range by
the total duration of monitoring. The ranges were defined
as
follows:
hypocapnia
(etCO2 < 35 mmHg),
normocapnia
(35‐55 mmHg) and hypercapnia ( > 55 mmHg). The Friedman
test was used to compare the differences in the percentage of
time spent in the three CO2 ranges (hypocapnia, normocapnia,
and hypercapnia). Dunn's test was then performed for pairwise
multiple comparisons of the ranked data. Data were analyzed
using IBM SPSS Statistics software version 23.0.0.0 (IBM Cor-
poration, Armonk, NY, USA), GraphPad Prism version 9 for
macOS (Boston, MA, USA), as well as R Statistical software
4.0.5. (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria).

Results
Sixty‐seven patients received TH over the 15 months study
period. Out of the 67 patients 7 were ventilated with HFOV, 2
received inhaled nitric oxide treatment on conventional venti-
lation for severe pulmonary hypertension, 1 died within 12 h of
life due to severe HIE associated with multi organ failure, the
remaining 22 cases did not have prospectively recorded etCO2
data. Altogether 35 patients on conventional ventilation with
available etCO2 recordings and corresponding blood gases were
included in the analysis. Patients demographics, clinical and
outcome data including MRI and Bayley test results are sum-
marized in Table 1.
A total of 262 paired etCO2 and PCO2 values corrected for the
rectal temperature and also analyzed at standard 37°C were
evaluated including 116 arterial samples from 18 patients, 132
capillary samples from 29 patients, and 14 venous samples from
8 patients.
The etCO2 monitoring started at median 10.9 [6.8; 20.6] hours
of age and the length of observation was median 71.0 [62.5;
78.4] hours corresponding to the time of hypothermia and re-
warming. No etCO2 readings exceeded 100 mmHg, and only
0.9% of all etCO2 data points (66,531 out of 7,367,926) were
below 20 mmHg; these low values were excluded before
analysis.

Agreement Between PCO2 and etCO2 Values
The average difference (bias) between the temperature cor-
rected arterial PaCO2 and etCO2 was 1.87 mmHg (SD 5.54) with
−8.99 and 12.73 limits of agreement on 116 corresponding data
points. The bias between the capillary PCO2 and etCO2 was
7.22 mmHg (SD 6.08) with −4.70 and 19.14 limits of agreement
on 132 corresponding data points. Similarly, the bias between
venous PCO2 and etCO2 was 8.07 mmHg with −2.53 and 18.67
limits of agreement, however the number of corresponding data
points were low (n = 14) (Table 2). Figure 1 represents BA plots
3 of 8


of temperature corrected arterial and capillary PCO2 and etCO2
values. Visual inspection of the BA plots could not identify a
difference in precision in lower versus higher PCO2 ranges,
suggesting that the etCO2 ‐ PCO2 agreement is similar in both
hypocapnia and hypercapnia.
Compared to the temperature corrected blood gas values poor
agreement found between uncorrected PCO2 values analyzed at
37◦C and corresponding etCO2 measurements. Agreement
between uncorrected blood gas values and etCO2 data is sum-
marized in Table 2.
Out of 35 infants, 4 (11.4%) presented with RDS, another 4
(11.4%) had MAS, all of them received surfactant replacement
therapy. One patient had pneumothorax requiring chest tube
insertion. Nine patients with significant pulmonary morbidities
were excluded from BA analysis.
Excluding patients with respiratory morbidities from the Bland‐
Altman analysis did not improve the agreement between PaCO2
and etCO2 (n = 96, bias (SD): 1.37 (5.79); 95% limits of agree-
ment: −9.99; 12.72) and capillary PCO2 and etCO2 (n = 81, bias
(SD): 7.84 (6.53); 95% limits of agreement: −4.95; 20.63)
(Table 2). Venous samples due to low number of data points
(n = 3) were insufficient for analysis.

Time Spent in Hypocapnia, Normocapnia
and Hypercapnia Based on etCO2 Monitoring
Infants spent median 23.9% [IQR 8.5; 36.7] of monitoring time
in hypocapnia (etCO2 range < 35 mmHg). Percentage of time
spent in normocapnia (35–55 mmHg) was median 75.0% [IQR
61.1; 87.7]. Infants spent less then 1% [IQR 0.0; 0.1] in hyper-
capnia based on continuous etCO2 measurements. Friedman
test revealed that patients spent significantly less time in
hypercapnia then in normocapnia or hypocapnia (p< 0.0001).
Significant difference was found also in time spent in normo-
capnia and hypocapnia (p = 0.0257) (Figure 2).

Discussion
We found a strong level of agreement between temperature
corrected arterial PCO2, the gold standard measurement, and
10‐min averaged high‐frequency etCO2 values in patients with
HIE treated with TH. The agreement was modest between the
temperature corrected capillary and venous PCO2 and etCO2
data. End‐tidal CO2 consistently underestimated PCO2 from any
source at 37°C but the level of bias was clinically unacceptable
for venous and capillary samples. Excluding infants with pul-
monary morbidities did not improve the level of agreement.
Several studies have assessed the accuracy of etCO2 monitoring,
primarily in preterm neonates, yielding controversial results
and emphasizing the impact of underlying lung diseases [22,
30–32]. However, Kugelman et al. proved in a randomized,
controlled multicenter study that continuous distal etCO2
monitoring reduced the rate of intraventricular hemorrhage
and periventricular leukomalacia in a group of patients where

etCO2 monitor was not masked and available for patient care
comparing to a masked group [33]. A similar randomized
controlled study is still awaited in infants with HIE with respect
to long term outcomes.
To date, this is the second study—and the only prospective
one—aimed at assessing the accuracy of etCO2 measurement in
infants undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. Similarly, to the
present study Afzal et al. reported marginally lower etCO2
compared to PaCO2 (median difference of 3 mmHg; IQR, 0–7)
based on 857 arterial samples from 58 patients. However,
the method of processing etCO2 data and whether side or
mainstream capnography was used remained unclear in their
paper [23].
We propose that the computationally analyzed and averaged
etCO2
measurements,
recorded
10 min
before
blood
gas
sampling are more representative than any cross‐sectional,
single etCO2 value, yielding a more reliable data agreement
analysis.
It is well known that ventilation‐perfusion mismatch, high
respiratory rate, and the ratio of physiological dead space to
tidal volume secondary lung disease negatively influence
the correlation between etCO2 and PCO2 [18, 22, 31, 34].
Two research groups showed that etCO2 correlated better
with PaCO2 in infants with less severe lung disease defined
as the ratio of physiological dead space to tidal volume.
Physiological dead space includes anatomical and alveolar
dead space which increases with the disease severity
[22, 31]. Of note, etCO2 tends to underestimate PaCO2 even
in healthy lungs due to the contribution of physiological
dead space, where alveolar CO2 is diluted by CO2‐free gas
from the dead space [18].

We need to highlight that the correlation coefficient improved sig-
nificantly more in very low birth weight infants (VLBW) comparing
to non‐VLBW infants utilizing the above detailed approach for
defining lung disease [31]. In the present study excluding infants
with lung disease did not result in any improvement in the level of
agreement. Of note, we did not use objective measures to define the
severity of lung injury. Furthermore, the effect of physiological dead
space may be more profound in preterm infants [31].

The partial pressures of gases and blood pH are temperature‐
dependent. At lower temperatures, gas solubility in plasma
increases, leading to lower measured PO2 and PCO2, and a
higher pH.
To address this problem during intensive care, two acid–base
management strategies, alpha‐stat and pH‐stat are available.
Currently, it is unclear if alpha‐stat or pH‐stat management
strategies should be preferred in neonates under hypothermia
treatment. In pH‐stat method PCO2, PO2 and pH are corrected
for the actual body temperature representing the true acid–base
status of the patients; whereas alpha‐stat management can
overestimate PCO2 and PO2 and underestimate pH if partial
tension of gases is analyzed at 37°C [35, 36]. Although further
investigation is needed to answer which management is supe-
rior over the other, pediatric data and recommendation from
CoolCap and NICHD hypothermia trial suggested to use tem-
perature correction (pH‐stat) [35, 37]. Based on our findings,
etCO2 estimates temperature corrected PCO2 values consider-
ably better than uncorrected PCO2 values; further supporting
the pH‐stat management approach.
The secondary aim of our study was to determine the time spent
in predefined PCO2 ranges based on continuous etCO2 mea-
surements. It is well established that hypocapnia is common in
the early hours of life, often resulting from compensatory
hyperventilation due to metabolic acidosis and impaired cere-
bral energy metabolism. Additionally, therapeutic hypothermia
further reduces metabolic rate, thereby decreasing CO2 pro-
duction and the amount of CO2 available for exhalation [6].
Previous studies showed that hypocapnia occurred at least once
in 57‐89% of infants with HIE within the first few hours of life
[7, 10, 38]. Furthermore, infants spent a median 15% of their
first 24 h in hypocapnia defined as a PCO2 level of ≤35 mmHg
based on linear interpolation between blood gas sampling times
[10]. Currently, we showed that patients spent median 24% of
etCO2 monitoring time in hypocapnia (< 35 mmHg) and
median 75% of their time between 35 and 55 mmHg. It remains
to be established whether continuously monitored etCO2 values
have any predictive value with respect to neurodevelopmental
outcome. However, it may be inferred from our present data,
that etCO2 correlates more closely to actual arterial PCO2 than
capillary samples, thus the severity and duration of hypocapnia
may be underestimated notoriously based on capillary blood gas
sampling.
Some limitations of the study should be acknowledged. First,
lung diseases were classified based on clinical diagnosis, without
objective measures to assess severity. Second, the predefined
normocapnia range of 35‐55 mmHg is broader than the physio-
logical standard of 35‐45 mmHg. However, Wong et al. reported
that PCO2 levels between 5 and 7 kPa (37.5–52.5 mmHg) may be
safe for neonates receiving ventilatory support [39]. Additionally,
the percentage of leak around the uncuffed endotracheal tube
was not recorded for analysis.
One key strength of our analysis is the high‐frequency sampling
rate of the etCO2 monitor, allowing us to analyze 12,000 data
points, rather than relying on a single reading of a dynamically
changing value. Furthermore, arterial, capillary, and venous
data were analyzed, recognizing that not all infants with HIE
have indwelling arterial catheters for blood draws. In addition,
we suggest that the noninvasive method of PCO2 monitoring
may reduce blood loss in critically ill infants and lower the risk
of infections.

Conclusion
There was a strong agreement between temperature‐corrected
arterial PaCO2 and etCO2 values in infants with moderate‐to‐
severe HIE. Given that nearly 50% of patients undergoing
therapeutic hypothermia require mechanical ventilation, etCO2
monitoring may be a valuable addition to respiratory and
neurocritical care in this population [10, 40, 41]. Further studies
are needed to evaluate whether end‐tidal etCO2 monitoring can
mitigate extreme CO2 levels and thereby improve neurodeve-
lopmental outcomes in HIE.
