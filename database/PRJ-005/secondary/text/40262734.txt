Background: Remimazolam is a novel short-acting benzodiazepine. We investigated the 
effects of low doses of volatile anesthetic agents on motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and 
somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) during remimazolam-remifentanil anesthesia.
Methods: Thirty-nine patients undergoing cervical spine surgery were randomly assigned 
to either the sevoflurane (n = 20) or desflurane (n = 19) groups. Volatile anesthetic agents 
were administered at 0.3, 0.6, and 0.8 minimum alveolar concentrations (MACs) during 
remimazolam-remifentanil anesthesia.  Significant changes were considered as more than 
50% amplitude suppression and more than 10% latency increase from baseline values. The 
primary outcome was MEP amplitude change. Secondary outcomes included MEP laten­
cy, SSEP amplitude and latency, and group comparisons.
Results: The MEP amplitudes were slightly reduced at 0.3 MAC; however, a suppression 
of more than 50% from baseline values at 0.3 MAC, particularly in the upper limbs, was 
observed in a notable proportion of participants; 30.0% and 47.4% in the sevoflurane and 
desflurane groups, respectively. The corresponding percentages for the lower limbs were 
15.0% and 15.8%, respectively. MEP amplitude suppression was more than 50% in the ma­
jority of participants at 0.6 and 0.8 MAC. No significant difference was observed between 
the groups. SSEPs exhibited no significant amplitude suppression or latency prolongation 
across all MAC levels. 
Conclusions: Notable MEP amplitude suppression was observed in many patients when 
0.3 MAC volatile anesthetics were used as adjuncts. Therefore, even low doses of volatile 
anesthetics must be added cautiously to remimazolam-based anesthesia to prevent con­
founding. The SSEPs were relatively preserved, regardless of MAC.

Introduction
Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is conducted during neuro, spi­
nal, and spinal cord surgery to preserve neurological function and prevent the incidence 
of postoperative neurological deficits and iatrogenic damage [1]. The most commonly 
used modalities in IONM include somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), motor 
evoked potentials (MEPs), and electromyography [2].
General anesthetic agents that inhibit neurotransmission exert a significant effect on 
the evoked potential (EP). Volatile anesthetic agents suppress EP in a dose-dependent

manner [3]. Low concentrations (0.5–1.0 minimum alveolar con­
centration [MAC]) of volatile anesthetic agents have been used 
successfully for monitoring SSEPs [3,4]. However, MEP monitor­
ing is more sensitive to general anesthetic agents, and lower con­
centrations (up to 0.5–0.6 MAC) of volatile anesthetic agents are 
considered suitable for effective monitoring [5]. Thus, the use of 
propofol-opioid infusion is preferred because its depressive effect 
on IONM is less pronounced than that of volatile anesthetic 
agents [5]. Nevertheless, concerns regarding hemodynamic insta­
bility and the dose-dependent suppression of MEPs following 
propofol infusion persist [6]. These limitations have led to in­
creasing research on combining intravenous (IV) anesthetic 
agents with volatile anesthetic agents [7–10] or other agents, such 
as dexmedetomidine [11] and lidocaine [12], as anesthetic adju­
vants. Anesthesiologists aim to mitigate undesirable effects and 
achieve synergistic effects through such combinations.
Remimazolam, a novel ultrashort-acting benzodiazepine, ex­
hibits a high clearance rate, a small volume of distribution, and 
rapid recovery [13]. Furthermore, it provides greater hemody­
namic stability, thereby facilitating its use as an alternative to 
propofol for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia 
[13,14]. Remimazolam has been reported to allow adequate mon­
itoring of both SSEPs and MEPs [15–17]. A recent prospective 
study compared the effects of total IV anesthesia using remima­
zolam and propofol on IONM [18], finding results comparable to 
those with propofol. However, data on the interaction between 
IONM and the combination of remimazolam with volatile anes­
thetic agents are scarce.
Commonly used volatile anesthetic agents, such as sevoflurane 
and desflurane, suppress MEP amplitude in a dose-dependent 
manner; however, discrepancies between these agents have been 
reported [9,10]. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the 
addition of volatile anesthetic agents during remimazol­
am-remifentanil anesthesia under concurrent MEP-SSEP moni­
toring. The changes in MEP amplitude with the increase in the 
dose of volatile anesthetic agents were assessed. Furthermore, we 
compared IONM responses between sevoflurane and desflurane.
Materials and Methods
This double-blinded, parallel-group, randomized controlled 
trial was conducted at a tertiary educational hospital in South Ko­
rea between January 2023 and December 2023. The study proto­
col was approved by the Asan Medical Center Institutional Re­
view Board (Approval number: 2022-0725) and was registered at 
the Clinical Research Information Service (https://cris.nih.go.kr/: 
KCT0007534) in South Korea before patient enrollment. The 
study protocol adhered to the Consolidated Standards of Report­
ing Trials (CONSORT) guidelines and the principles of the Decla­
ration of Helsinki of 2013. Written informed consent was ob­
tained from all patients before inclusion.
Study population and design
Patients aged 20–79 years with an American Society of Anes­
thesiologists physical status of grade I–III who underwent elective 
cervical spine surgery at our institution and received IONM were 
eligible for inclusion in the study. The exclusion criteria were as 
follows: tolerance or hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, depen­
dence or addiction to psychotropic drugs or alcohol, history of 
brain-related neurosurgery, presence of an intracranial device or 
pacemaker, pregnant and lactating women, history of acute nar­
row-angle glaucoma, moderate hypersensitivity to dextran 40, 
history or susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, and history 
of hypersensitivity to halogenated inhalational agents.
An internet-based randomization program (sealedenvelope.
com) was used to create a randomization list with an un-stratified 
block size of four. Patients were assigned to the desflurane (n = 
20) and sevoflurane (n = 20) groups at a 1:1 ratio. Data collection 
and interventions were performed by the first investigator (W.K.). 
The first investigator received the enrollment data and a random 
number from the second investigator (H.S.P.) on the day of the 
surgery. The neurologist, trained technologists, and all patients 
were blinded to the type of volatile anesthetic agents and the in­
spiratory concentration used during data collection and analysis.
The baseline values were obtained before commencing the ad­
ministration of each inhalational agent (Baseline, Fig. 1) after 
completing the main procedure with IV anesthesia using remim­
azolam and remifentanil. Age-adjusted MAC was applied in the 
present study. The first concentration (0.3 MAC) of the volatile 
anesthetic agent was introduced and the MAC was increased from 
0.6 to 0.8 in an incremental manner. A five-minute steady-state 
was maintained at each time point before the IONM data were 
obtained. After each recording, each volatile anesthetic was 
washed out using a fresh gas flow over 8 L/min. Washout was 
considered in this study when the end-tidal concentration of the 
volatile anesthetic approached 0.0%. Final MEPs and SSEPs data 
were then obtained (End).
Anesthesia protocol
Monitoring, including a noninvasive blood pressure monitor, 
pulse oximeter, three-lead electrocardiogram, and a SedLine® 
EEG-sensor (Masimo Corp.), was commenced on entering the

operating room. The core body temperature was measured and 
maintained at 35.5°–37.0°C. Remimazolam (Byfavo Inj, Hana 
Pharm Co., Ltd.) was infused continuously at a rate of 6 mg/kg/h 
until the patient lost consciousness to induce general anesthesia. 
Remimazolam was infused continuously at a rate of 0.9–1.5 mg/
kg/h at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologists and with­
in the range of the approved maintenance dose [13]. Remifentan­
il was administered via target effect-site concentration-controlled 
infusion [19] and maintained at an effect-site concentration of 
3–5 ng/ml. A bolus dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) was admin­
istered to facilitate endotracheal intubation. An arterial line cath­
eter was inserted following intubation to monitor invasive arteri­
al pressure. In addition, a bite block was inserted to protect the 
teeth and tongue during IONM. Additional doses of rocuronium 
were not administered during surgery. The administration of 
sugammadex at a dose of 2–4 mg/kg is permitted when the train-
of-four (TOF) ratio is maintained at less than 0.8 after vertebral 
body exposure to achieve adequate electrical stimulation intensi­
ty for MEPs. Notably, this intervention was not required in any 
case in the present study. The study intervention was initiated 
when the surgeons started to close the surgical field after con­
firming the final IONM results (Fig. 1). A single IV bolus dose of 
flumazenil (0.2 mg) was administered after the surgery to reverse 
the effects of remimazolam.
IONM
Trained neurophysiological monitoring technologists at our in­
stitution performed IONM, under the supervision of neurologists. 
The IONM data were analyzed by a neurologist and the second in­
vestigator (H.S.P.). Neuromaster MEE-1000, MEE-2000 (Nihon 
Kohden), and CADWELL cascade (Cadwell Laboratories) were 
used to perform neurophysiological monitoring. Transcranial elec­
trodes were used as stimulation electrodes at stimulation sites C3 
(cathode) and C4 (anode) in accordance with the International 10–
20 system [20]. The stimulus waveform was a constant current with 
a rectangular pulse of electrical stimulus intensity (100–500 V). 
The first EP stimulation was performed after the completion of 
general anesthesia induction and electrode placement to examine 
the electrode positions and assess the signal while under the influ­
ence of neuromuscular blocking agents. The stimulation was grad­
ually increased upon exposure of the vertebral body and attaining a 
TOF of more than 0.8 until a reproducible MEP was elicited. Fol­
lowing determination, the individual stimulation intensity was 
maintained without alteration for the duration of the surgery. Tran­
scranial MEPs were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis 
(APB) and abductor hallucis longus (AHL) for the upper and lower 
limbs, respectively. All sites were monitored bilaterally. The param­
eters for MEP electrical stimulation were as follows: stimulus dura­
tion, 0.05–0.075 ms; interstimulus interval, 2.0 ms; trains of three 
to six stimuli; bandpass filter, 10–30 Hz and 2 000–3 000 Hz; and 
recording time, 100 ms. The MEPs were manually monitored at in­
tervals of 5–15 min; in addition, monitoring was performed inter­
mittently to prevent unwanted patient movement during surgery.
Cortical SSEP stimulations were elicited at the bilateral median 
nerve of the wrist and posterior tibial nerve of the internal malle­
olus. A single-pulse stimulation with a pulse duration of 0.1–0.5 
ms, intensity of 10–30 mA, and frequency of 4.7 Hz was applied 
to elicit SSEP. The bandpass filter setting was maintained at 
20–1 000 Hz (high-cut, 2–3 kHz; low-cut, 10–30 Hz). SSEPs, 
monitored continuously by a computer or at intervals of 1–2 min 
throughout the procedures, were averages of 200–1 000 sweeps. 
These stimulation conditions were maintained before and after 
changing the anesthetic agents.

The peak-to-peak amplitudes and onset latency were measured 
during the study intervention. A decrease of more than 50% in 
the amplitude or an increase of more than 10% in latency was de­
fined as an alarm sign in this study [5,8].
Outcome variables
The primary outcome of this study was the change in MEP am­
plitude in response to increasing concentrations of inhalational 
agents during the background infusion of remimazolam-remifen­
tanil. At each MAC, we calculated the percentage change in am­
plitude relative to the baseline measurement obtained before the 
administration of inhalational agents (Baseline). The secondary 
outcome measures included the changes in the latency of MEPs 
and the amplitude and latency of SSEPs, as well as comparison 
between the sevoflurane and desflurane groups in terms of these 
variables.
Sample size and statistical analysis
A previous study revealed that desflurane at a MAC of 0.5 
achieved a MEP amplitude suppression of 1 039.22 μV to 607.4 
μV, with a standard deviation of 701.0 μV [9]. Thus, assuming a 
power of 0.8 and an alpha level of 0.1, at least 17 participants were 
required to observe a statistically significant change in the ampli­
tude from the baseline value. Twenty participants were evenly al­
located between the two groups to account for a dropout rate of 
20%, thereby facilitating exploratory intergroup comparisons.
The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the distribution of 
continuous variables. Student’s t-test or the Mann–Whitney U test 
was used as appropriate to compare continuous variables between 
the groups. Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used as ap­
propriate to compare categorical variables between the groups. 
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (MD), median 
(Q1, Q3), or n (%). The effects of inhalational agents repeatedly 
measured over time were analyzed using the linear mixed-effects 
model as it accounts for repeated measures, missing data, and un­
equal sample sizes (sevoflurane group = 20, desflurane group = 
19). The patients were designated as random effects while model­
ing the data to account for inter-individual differences. Unstruc­
tured covariance was used to maintain flexibility in the relation­
ships between repeated measurements. The concentration of the 
inhalational agent (MAC) and anesthesia grouping (including the 
interaction term) were defined as the fixed effects [21]. Quantita­
tive analysis was performed to analyze the percentages of differ­
ences in amplitude and latency values from the baseline values. 
The compared data are presented as the least square means 
(LSMs) ± standard error (SE). LSMs account for group and time 
imbalances, as well as missing data; thus, it varies from raw 
means. This approach facilitated valid intergroup comparisons of 
the outcomes, as well as comparison between the outcomes at 
specific time points (the concentration of the inhalational agent), 
even with missing observational data. Pairwise comparisons of 
the LSMs were conducted to assess the intra-group and inter­
group differences at each time point (MAC). Statistical signifi­
cance was set at P = 0.05 for all comparisons.
Results
Among the 40 participants enrolled, one participant withdrew 
from the study. Thus, the final analysis included 39 participants 
(Fig. 2). No significant differences were observed between the two 
groups in terms of the baseline demographic or clinical character­
istics (Table 1). IONM was completed without adverse events in 
all cases. No postoperative neurological deficits were observed in 
any of the participants.
Changes in MEP amplitudes in response to increment 
MAC
The percentage change in the amplitude at 0.3 MAC revealed a 
slight reduction in both groups (Fig. 3). The percentage change 
observed in the upper limb in the desflurane group was higher 
than that in the sevoflurane group (22.2% vs. 43.4%); however, 
this difference between the inhalational groups was not significant 
at 0.3 MAC (P = 0.147). The percentage change in amplitude was 
more than 50% of the baseline value as the MAC increased to 0.8 
(Fig. 3). However, the amplitude suppression did not recover to 
levels close to the baseline at the end time-point. The remaining 
amplitude changes were comparable between the two groups.
The suppression rates (proportion of participants with signifi­
cant amplitude changes) at 0.3 MAC were 6/20 (30.0%) for the 
upper limbs in the sevoflurane group and 9/19 (47.4%) in the des­
flurane group (Table 2). The corresponding rates for the lower 
limbs were 3/20 (15.0%) in the sevoflurane group and 3/19 
(15.8%) in the desflurane group. Differences between the groups 
in terms of the suppression rates were not statistically significant 
throughout the study. The MEP amplitude signal disappeared in 
four of the 20 participants when the concentration of sevoflurane 
increased from 0.3 MAC to 0.6 MAC (Table 2). On the other 
hand, the MEP amplitude signal disappeared in one of the 19 par­
ticipants in the desflurane group at 0.8 MAC. Signal reappearance 
after the discontinuation of the administration of volatile anes­
thetics (End) was observed in these participants. The LSM value

Changes in MEP latency, SSEP amplitudes, and SSEP 
latency
The LSM of the MEP latency was not significantly prolonged 
and the percentage changes were less than 10% from the baseline 
value in the upper and lower limbs as the MAC increased (Sup­
plementary Table 1). The latency changes in the sevoflurane and 
desflurane groups were comparable.
The LSM of the SSEP amplitude in the lower limb decreased 
significantly in a dose-dependent manner in the desflurane group 
(P = 0.023, Supplementary Table 2). No changes were observed 
in the upper limb; however, the percentage change in amplitude at 
any time point was within 50% in the upper and lower limbs. In 
the sevoflurane group, the LSM of the SSEP amplitude in both the 
upper and lower limbs did not differ significantly (P = 0.396 for 
the upper limb and P = 0.227 for the lower limb, Supplementary 
Table 2). No significant interaction was observed between the 
groups and each time point (P = 0.537 for the upper limb and P 
= 0.060 for the lower limb).
SSEP latency of the upper limbs increased significantly as the 
MAC was increased in an incremental manner in both groups (P 
< 0.001, Supplementary Table 2). However, the percentage change 
was less than 10% of the baseline value. The latencies of the lower 
limbs were not prolonged in either group (P = 0.594 and P = 
0.103, respectively). A significant interaction between the groups 
and each time-point was observed for the upper limb (P = 0.020); 
however, no significant interaction was noted for the lower limb (P 
= 0.330). The changes in the latency and amplitude of SSEP were 
comparable between the two groups (Supplementary Table 2).

Discussion
The present study evaluated the effects of adding volatile anes­
thetic agents to remimazolam on the intraoperative MEP and 
SSEP monitoring during general anesthesia. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the impact of this 
combination on MEP responses during cervical spine surgery. Al­
though the mean percent change was not statistically significant, a 
considerable proportion of participants exhibited significant MEP 
amplitude suppression–particularly in the upper limbs–even at a 
low dose (0.3 MAC), with greater suppression observed at con­
centrations more than 0.6 MAC. In some cases, no MEP repro­
ducible signal was detected. In contrast, the SSEPs were minimally 
affected throughout the study. No significant differences were ob­
served between the sevoflurane and desflurane groups in terms of 
MEPs and SSEPs. These findings suggest that caution is warranted 
when using volatile anesthetic agents for MEP monitoring with a 
background infusion of remimazolam.
The findings of the present study are consistent with previous 
studies indicating that sevoflurane and desflurane suppress MEP 
amplitudes in a dose-dependent manner. However, in contrast to 
these studies that suggested that a limited concentration (≤ 0.5 
MAC) of volatile anesthetic agents enables the reliable monitoring 
of transcranial MEPs when used in combination with remifentan­
il or propofol [5,7–10,22,23], the present study could not confirm 
this effect at such low concentrations of volatile anesthetic agents. 
Both propofol and volatile anesthetic agents bind with the gam­
ma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor; however, their 
effects on EP response vary. Rather than inhibiting the excitability 
of the motor neurons in the spinal cord, propofol predominantly 
inhibits the supra-spinal motor pathways, resulting in gradual 
suppression of the MEP amplitudes during prolonged infusion 
[24]. Volatile anesthetic agents suppress SSEPs by acting on the 
sensory neurons in the thalamus and sensory cortex, whereas they 
affect the MEPs via the corticospinal tract through the alpha mo­
tor neuron synapses [25]. Midazolam, a conventional benzodiaze­
pine that acts on the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor, 
can be used for SSEP monitoring due to its minimal suppressive 
effect [3,26,27]. Its mild to moderate suppressive effect on MEP 
amplitude can be mitigated by adjusting the electrical stimulation 
parameters [28–30]. Remimazolam may produce effects similar 
to those of propofol or midazolam when combined with volatile 
anesthetic agents. However, previous studies have not studied 
such interactions. Thus, the findings of the present study provide 
new insights into this area.
The findings of the present study suggest that the suppression 
of MEP amplitudes induced by the combination of remimazolam 
and volatile anesthetic agents was more pronounced than that ob­
served with the combination of propofol or opioids and volatile 
anesthetic agents [8]. According to the alarm criteria for IONM 
employed at our institution which generally define significant re­
duction as an amplitude decrease of more than 50% of the base­
line MEP values [5],  a notable proportion of participants exhibit­
ed such suppression even at 0.3 MAC: 30%  in the sevoflurane 
group and 47.4% in the desflurane groups, based on upper limb 
monitoring. However, the alarm criteria and their interpretation 
exhibit mild variations across different institutions [31], as they 
are influenced by factors such as anesthetic parameters (e.g., tem­
perature, depth of anesthesia, blood pressure, and the use of neu­
romuscular blockade), pre-existing neurological deficits, and the 
intensity of electrical stimulation [32,33]. Thus, these findings 
suggest that a higher alarm threshold may be required when add­
ing volatile anesthetics to remimazolam infusion. Future studies 
to examine the neurological outcomes are warranted.
The present study could not confirm whether remimazolam 
exhibits ‘anesthetic fade’ with prolonged infusion [6] or dose-re­
lated adverse effects. Notably, a loading dose of remimazolam 
suppressed MEP amplitude in a case report [17]. A continuous 
infusion rate of 2.0 mg/kg/h has been deemed reproducible for 
MEP amplitude monitoring [16]. Differences in the plasma con­
centration of remimazolam may have also contributed to variabil­
ity in the MEP responses. However, the infusion rate and accu­
mulated dose of remimazolam at the time of MEP measurements 
were not recorded in the present study. Kim et al. [18] reported a 
slight increase in the MEP amplitudes over time in the remima­
zolam and propofol groups. However, this may be attributed to 
the decreased effect of neuromuscular blocking agents. Thus, fur­
ther studies must be conducted to determine the effects of the 
plasma concentration of remimazolam on MEP response and ac­
curately estimate its effect.
Discrepancies were observed between the MEP responses of 
the upper and lower limbs in the present study.  MEP amplitude 
of the upper limbs was relatively lower than that of the lower 
limbs, and the suppression rate of the APB muscle was higher 
than that of the AHL muscle at 0.3 MAC for both volatile anes­
thetics. These findings contradict the findings of previous studies 
that reported that the lower limbs were generally more sensitive to 
anesthetic-induced depression [34,35]. This discrepancy may be 
attributed to the differences between the corticospinal tract re­
sponse of the upper and lower limbs such as D wave refractory 
periods and anatomical factors (e.g., the length of the electrode 
needle and its distance from the target muscle) [34,35]. The pre­
operative motor strength state may have contributed to the varia­
tions in the MEP responses, as a motor strength of less than 3 is

associated with reduced MEP recordings [36]. This study did not 
include participants with significant motor weakness (< 3–4); 
however, cervical myelopathy in the participants may have con­
tributed to the lower amplitude values in the upper extremities. A 
previous study found that MEP monitorability tended to be lower 
in cervical spine surgery compared to lumbar spine surgery, par­
ticularly with the use of inhalational anesthetic agents [37].
The SSEP amplitudes and latencies were minimally affected by 
anesthesia. These findings are consistent with those of previous 
studies that reported that the administration of low concentra­
tions of up to 0.3–1.0 MAC is permitted for reliable SSEP moni­
toring [4,7,8,10]. The latency of MEPs and SSEPs that are more 
resistant to suppression by anesthesia also remained largely un­
changed. This finding is also consistent with those of previous re­
ports on midazolam [28] and volatile anesthetics [10].
No significant differences were observed between the two inha­
lational groups. Two previous studies comparing the effects of 
sevoflurane and desflurane at 0.3 MAC revealed differing results 
[9,10]; thus, which inhalational agent had a greater inhibitory ef­
fect on EP was unclear. The findings of the present study indicate 
that stronger suppression of MEP amplitudes was observed in the 
desflurane group; however, this effect was limited to the upper 
limbs. This variability between the agents may be attributed to in­
ter-individual differences in terms of the response to volatile anes­
thetics and differences in the degree of synaptic inhibitions they 
induce [10].
This study has several limitations. First, the sample size was cal­
culated to detect the changes in MEP amplitudes in response to 
volatile anesthetics. The sample size calculation did not specifical­
ly account for the effect size required to detect intergroup differ­
ences; consequently, this limitation primarily affects the second­
ary outcome and does not compromise the validity of the primary 
finding. Nevertheless, the adoption of the randomized controlled 
trial design was necessary to address the secondary outcome that 
aimed to compare the effects of two volatile anesthetics on IONM. 
Second, this study measured the final IONM values (End) after 
ceasing the administration of the volatile anesthetic agents. The 
blood concentration of desflurane and sevoflurane are known to 
decrease to clinically insignificant levels approximately 20 min af­
ter discontinuation [38,39]. Although the exact washout duration 
was not recorded in the present study, the End values were mea­
sured approximately 10 min after stopping volatile anesthetic 
agents, based on the end-tidal concentration. However, due to the 
dilution effect in the lung, the end-tidal concentration of the anes­
thetics tends to decrease earlier than the corresponding reduction 
in the blood concentration. As a result, significant amplitude sup­
pression was still observed at the End time-point (Fig. 3). Further­
more, the persistence of substantial amplitude reduction suggests 
that once suppression occurs, a sufficient recovery period is re­
quired due to residual effects of volatile anesthetic agents. A previ­
ous study compared MEP amplitudes measured 35 min after des­
flurane cessation between a group receiving desflurane followed 
by a propofol infusion and a standard propofol infusion group 
[23]. The results showed that a mean MEP amplitude similar be­
tween the two groups. Notably, the 95% CI was wider in the des­
flurane group, leading the authors to suggest that this variability 
was possibly due to the residual effects of desflurane. Third, the 
addition of inhalational anesthetics to IV anesthesia may lead to 
an abrupt decrease in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) that may 
affect autoregulation [31]. Reduced autoregulation decreases the 
blood flow to the neurons and produces IONM response variabil­
ity [31,40]. A MAP of ≥ 65 mmHg was targeted during the study 
period; however, some patients have higher lower limits of auto­
regulation [33]. Furthermore, interventions such as reducing the 
infusion rate of IV anesthetics or administering vasopressors (e.g., 
phenylephrine or ephedrine) may have affected the MEP ampli­
tude by elevating the excitability of motor neurons [41]. These 
factors were not analyzed in the present study. Fourth, the remim­
azolam-remifentanil dose was titrated based on the patient state 
index from SedLine; however, PSI was not strictly maintained 
within a refined range. Anesthetic depth is correlated with MEP 
monitoring [42]; thus, equivalent anesthetic depth is critical for 
evaluating the effects of different agents. Lastly, volatile anesthetic 
agents provide immobility and amnesia even at low doses [7,43]; 
however, the present study focused solely on assessing changes in 
MEP and SSEP response, and did not comprehensively evaluate 
the clinical outcomes of adding volatile anesthetic agents.
In conclusion, the use of volatile anesthetic agents with a back­
ground infusion of remimazolam resulted in MEP amplitude sup­
pression even at 0.3 MAC. Thus, volatile anesthetic agents must 
be used cautiously in conjunction with remimazolam during MEP 
monitoring. Further dose-finding studies of volatile agents com­
bined with remimazolam and remifentanil anesthesia must be 
conducted to optimize MEPs during spinal surgery.
