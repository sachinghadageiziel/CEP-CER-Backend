35688889,In vitro evaluation of the effects of different particle types in toothpastes on the efficacy against enamel erosion and wear.,Scientific reports,2022,"Fischer M, Schlueter N, Rupf S, Ganss C","The effects of the particle fraction in toothpastes in the context of erosion and erosive tooth wear has not been fully elucidated. Thus, aim of this study was to investigate experimental toothpastes, each with one specific particle type. Toothpastes with seven different types of silica or alumina were prepared as slurry either with or without active ingredients (NaF or F/Sn). Human enamel samples were exposed to a cyclic erosion/abrasion model, and were either treated with the respective slurries only or additionally brushed in a brushing machine. Tissue loss was profilometrically monitored. After treatment with slurries without active ingredients or with NaF, tissue loss increased significantly within groups over time (p < 0.001 each). At the end of the trial, there were minor differences between groups (not exceeding 10-20%; p > 0.05 for most comparisons). After treatment with the F/Sn slurries, tissue loss stagnated completely over time, with the exception of one silica type and alumina, but both still reduced tissue loss by 40-50% (compared to control p < 0.001 each). Relative to the type of the active ingredient, the particle type seems to be a secondary factor for the efficacy of toothpastes on erosion and erosive tooth wear in enamel.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35688889/
