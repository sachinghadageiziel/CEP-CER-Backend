40079880,Coronal microleakage of endodontic access restorations in zirconia crowns.,General dentistry,2025,"Ragsdale KW, Adcook RS, Avillo AJ, Burns KH, Hernandez-Feldpausch M, Steigerwald JC, Huber JH, Hamlin NJ, Dickens NE, Kim JJ","Inadequate marginal sealing in endodontically treated teeth can lead to microleakage and treatment failure. The purpose of this in vitro study was to quantify and compare the quality of the marginal seal when different materials and bonding techniques were used to restore endodontic access cavities in zirconia cylinders. Fifty custom zirconia cylinders (10.0 mm in diameter × 14.0 mm in height; wall thickness of 1.5 mm) were prepared with simulated endodontic access cavities (5.0 mm in diameter). The cylindrical specimens were divided into 5 groups, each assigned a different method of access cavity restoration (n = 10 per group): direct glass ionomer cement restorations; direct composite resin restorations adhesively bonded without prior aluminum oxide (Al",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40079880/
39476015,Biomimetic Restorative Dentistry: an evidence-based discussion of common myths.,Journal of applied oral science : revista FOB,2024,"Reis A, Feitosa VP, Chibinski AC, Favoreto MW, Gutierrez MF, Loguercio AD","This narrative review critically examines some protocols of biomimetic restorative dentistry (BRD), which supposedly outperforms traditional adhesive techniques. This review explores the origins of BRD, introduces cognitive biases influencing the adoption of BRD protocols without evidence scrutiny, and discusses nine BRD protocols. For this, we searched randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews in the literature on the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library CENTRAL databases, which lead to the following conclusions about the revised protocols: 1) The use of dyes excessively removes carious dentin; 2) Aluminum oxide air abrasion contributes to overtreatment and may pose long-term health risks to dental professionals; 3) Beveling enamel in posterior teeth is technically difficult and leads to unnecessary loss of adjacent sound enamel with no evidence of its use outperforming butt-joint preparations; 4) Deactivating matrix metalloproteinases with chlorhexidine shows no clinical evidence of improving restoration longevity. 5) ""Elected"" gold-standard adhesive systems perform no better than other good performing available systems; 6) Immediate dentin sealing and resin coating result in similar post-operative sensitivity and longevity of indirect fillings as delayed dentin sealing; 7) Deep margin elevation is a viable alternative to manage subgingival margins in occlusoproximal cavities; 8) The process of ""decoupling"" with time lacks scientific evidence to support its use; 9) Placing fiber inserts on the pulpal floor and/or axial wall to minimize stress offers no benefits over current alternatives. In conclusion, more rigorous research is needed to validate BRD protocols, focusing on important clinical outcomes that impact in the longevity of the restoration, such as fracture, debonding, post-operative sensitivity, esthetic quality, presence of caries lesions adjacent to restorations and patients' satisfaction need to be thoroughly investigated. Reliance on anecdotal evidence, clinical experience, and common sense propagates myths and undervalues the need for a critical approach in evaluating dental techniques.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39476015/
39118080,Evaluation of vertical marginal discrepancy and load-to-failure of monolithic zirconia and lithium disilicate laminate veneers manufactured in different thicknesses.,BMC oral health,2024,"Yıldız P, Güneş Ünlü D, Aydoğdu HM","This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of monolithic zirconia laminate veneers (MZLV) compared to lithium disilicate laminate veneers (LDLV).
Sixty resin replicas, each prepared with depths of 0.5 mm, 0.7 mm, and 1 mm, were produced using a 3D printer from acrylic teeth. Laminate veneers of these thicknesses were milled from pre-sintered monolithic zirconia (3rd generation) and lithium disilicate blocks. The intaglio surface of MZLV was treated with air abrasion using 110 μm diameter silica-modified aluminium oxide particles and ceramic primer, while LDLV was etched with etchant gel and treated with the ceramic primer before cementation with resin cement. Vertical marginal discrepancy (VMD) was assessed using a stereomicroscope, and a load-to-failure test was conducted using a universal testing machine. Failure modes were evaluated macroscopically on fractured surfaces. Data were analysed statistically using Two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction (α = 0.05).
LDLV samples exhibited significantly larger VMD compared to MZLV samples across all thicknesses, especially in cervical, palatal, and mean data. Within the LDLV group, load-to-fracture values for 0.7 mm and 1.0 mm thicknesses were similar, whereas for 0.5 mm thickness, it was significantly lower. In the MZLV group, load-to-fracture values were lower for 0.7 mm and 1.0 mm thicknesses compared to LDLV, but higher for 0.5 mm thickness.
Material choice and restoration thickness significantly influence laminate veneer restorations' success. MZLV generally exhibits superior vertical marginal fit compared to LDLV, with varying load-to-failure values across different thicknesses. Clinical management of debonding in MZLV is simpler compared to restoration fracture in LDLV.
Considering clinical factors, MZLV may be a preferable option to LDLV for this restoration with the thickness of 0.5 mm.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39118080/

Ninety human mandibular first molars were divided into three main groups: endocrowns without ferrule, with 1 mm ferrule, and with 2 mm ferrule. The subgroups were defined by their surface pretreatment method used (n = 15): 50 μm alumina air-particle abrasion, silica coating using 30 μm Cojet™ particles, and Zircos-E® etching. The endocrowns were fabricated using multilayer zirconia ceramic, cemented with self-adhesive resin cement, and subjected to 5000 thermocycles (5-55°C) before debonding. The data obtained were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA.
All test specimens survived the thermocyclic aging. The results indicated that both the preparation design and the surface treatment had a significant impact on the resistance to debonding of the endocrowns (p < .001). The 2 mm ferrule followed by the 1 mm ferrule designs exhibited the highest debonding resistance, both were superior to the endocrown without ferrule. Zircos-E® etching and silica coating yielded comparable debonding resistance, which were significantly higher than alumina air-particle abrasion. All endocrowns demonstrated a favorable failure mode.
All designs and surface treatments showed high debonding resistance for a single restoration. However, ferrule designs with Zircos-E® etching or silica coating may represent better clinical options compared to the nonferrule design or alumina airborne-particle abrasion. Nonetheless, further research, including fatigue testing and evaluations with different luting agents is recommended.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38770577/
37981045,Long-term clinical outcome of three-unit fixed-fixed posterior zirconia ceramic inlay-retained FDPs with a modified design.,Journal of dentistry,2024,"Chaar MS, Passia N, Becker M, Kern M","To assess the long-term clinical outcome of posterior inlay-retained fixed dental prostheses (IRFDPs) with a modified design made from zirconia ceramic.
In 30 patients thirty 3-unit IRFDPs were placed to replace 7 premolars (4 in the maxilla, 3 in the mandible), and 23 first molars (15 in the maxilla, 8 in the mandible). Preparations were accomplished in agreement with the general principles for ceramic inlay restorations and modified with a short retainer-wing bevel preparation within the enamel at the buccal and oral sides. The frameworks were milled from 3Y-TZP ceramic, and the pontics were veneered with feldspathic ceramic. All IRFDPs were bonded with a phosphate monomer containing luting resin after air-abrasion of the intaglio surfaces. The patients were recalled 6-12 months after placement, and then annually. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate the survival and complication rates of the IRFDPs.
The mean observation time was 10.6 ± 1.5 years. The 10-year cumulative survival rate was 89% with 4 failures, two of them were due to deep secondary caries with loss of retention, one due to repeated debonding with enamel fractures, and one due to generalized progressive periodontitis. The most common complication was chipping of the veneering ceramic (20.1%). Eighteen IRFDPs were free of any type of complication up to 15.4 years, which corresponds to a 10-year cumulative success rate of 70.4%.
The long-term clinical performance of modified IRFDPs made of veneered zirconia ceramics was favorable after 10 years, therefore, they represent a treatment alternative to replace posterior single missing teeth.
Zirconia-based IRFDPs fabricated in the modified design may represent a substance-preserving alternative to conventional posterior FDPs to replace posterior single missing teeth, particularly in cases where implants cannot be placed, and when the adjacent teeth already have small restorations or defects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37981045/
37816489,Effects of silane coupling treatment on the clinical performance of direct repaired resin-based composite (RBC) restorations with or without prior surface sandblasting: A randomized controlled trial.,Journal of dentistry,2023,"Albashaireh ZSM, Maghaireh GA, Alsaafeen HN","To evaluate the effects, of using silane coupling agent within the procedures of repairing old composite restorations with or without sandblasting their surfaces, on the clinical performance of repaired composite restorations.
The study involved repairing 130 Class I and II defective composite restorations. After recurrent caries removal, the repair process included etching with 37 % phosphoric acid, Adper Single Bond 2 application for bonding and Filtek Z250 composite for restoring all defects. The restoration surfaces were subjected to one of the following additional surface treatments within the repair process: Control: No additional treatment; the Silane-Adhesive treatment: A separate step involved the application of a silane coupling agent after acid etching; and the Sandblast-Silane-Adhesive treatment: included intra-oral sandblasting of old composite surfaces followed by silane application. Two calibrated examiners evaluated all repaired restorations according to a modified USPHS criteria after 6 months. Comparisons of the clinical performance between the treatment groups were made using Chi-square test, while responses to cold tests before and after repair treatment were made using Wilcoxon's Signed Rank's (α = 0.05).
Of 130 cases, only 116 cases turned up for evaluation. The primary reasons for composite repair were recurrent caries and anatomical deficiencies. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups for all clinical criteria (p > 0.05). The control group experienced one total and two partial retention losses.
The application of a silane coupling agent, with or without intra-oral sandblasting, demonstrated no improvement on the clinical performance of repaired posterior composites after 6-months.
Surface treatment of defective composite restorations using silane with intra-oral sandblasting within their repair process offered marginal improvement in their clinical performance over conventional etching technique, but insignificantly so. Repair reduced exaggerated cold test responses and eliminated POS within 6-months. Repair reduces cold sensitivity and promotes restoration longevity.

36754733,Cleaning methods of contaminated zirconia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials,2023,"Thammajaruk P, Guazzato M, Naorungroj S","The aims of this study were to systematically review the literature and statistically analyze the effectiveness of different cleaning methods on the bond strength of resin cement to zirconia in short- and long-term aging conditions.
The literature was electronically searched in PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, Wiley, Scopus, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations databases to select relevant articles that evaluated the bond strength between contaminated zirconia and resin cements. A manual search was performed by scanning the reference lists of included studies.
All articles were published online before April 2022 and in English. Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD) between uncontaminated zirconia and various cleaning methods in two aging conditions (short- and long-term). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I-square statistics. The risk of bias of all included studies was assessed. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
Of the 1181 studies, 25 studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analyses. In short-term aging condition, cleaning contaminated zirconia with water, alcohol, or acid etching reported significantly lower bond strength than uncontaminated zirconia. For long-term aging condition, cleaning contaminated zirconia with water, cleaning agents, alcohol, or acid etching reported significantly lower bond strength than uncontaminated zirconia. Alumina air-abrasion or cleaning with sodium hypochlorite were comparable to uncontaminated zirconia for both short- and long-term aging conditions.
This meta-analysis appeared to indicate that the cleaning methods of contaminated zirconia restoration have an effect on zirconia bonding.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36754733/

A standardized inlay preparations were performed on 100 intact maxillary premolars. According to the type of the restorative material, the teeth were randomly divided into two equally sized groups (n = 50): (polymer-infiltrated ceramic (Vita Enamic) and resin-based composites (Lava Ultimate)). The inlays were fabricated using CAD/CAM technology. In each group, the specimens were randomly assigned to five subgroups (n = 10) according to the surface treatment method: group 1 used was the control group (no surface treatment); group 2, was treated with air abrasion with 50 μm Al
Surface treatments significantly increased the µTBS of the materials compared to the control group (p < 0.05). For CAD/CAM RBCs, the µTBS value highest in group 2 whereas, for PICN, the µTBS value was highest in group 3. Cohesive failure of CAD/CAM restorative material was the most predominant mode of failure in all treated groups, whereas adhesive failure at restoration-cement interface was the most predominant failure mode in the control group.
Surface treatments increase the µTBS of resin-matrix CAD/CAM ceramics to tooth structure. Air abrasion followed by universal adhesive and hydrofluoric acid followed by silane application appears to be the best strategies for optimizing the bond strength of CAD/CAM RBCs and PICN respectively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36564766/
34002718,A Simple Technique to Repair Feldspathic Porcelain Chipping in Screw-retained Implant-supported Prosthesis: A Clinical Technique.,The journal of contemporary dental practice,2021,"Proaño L, Silva RK, Cruz AC, Özcan M, Volpato CÂ","This clinical technique report aimed to describe a composite resin repair technique performed in an implant-supported prosthesis.
Veneering ceramic fracture or chipping is one of the most frequent clinical failures in dentistry. Therefore, the use of less time- and cost-consuming ceramic repair techniques is helpful in clinical practice.
Briefly, to treat the ceramic surface, the glaze was removed at the margins of the fracture area, then, air-abrasion and acid-etching were performed. To promote chemical adhesion, a silane coupling agent and adhesive system were applied over the ceramic surface, and the composite resin was applied by incremental technique. Finally, the polish was performed.
In conclusion, the applied composite resin repair of feldspathic porcelain chipping in implant-supported prosthesis was a simple, easy, affordable, and minimally invasive treatment.
The causes of veneer materials failures in metal-ceramic crowns are considered a challenge for the dentist and a problem that displeases patients. Repairs are indicated to prevent cracks from spreading and to prevent the accumulation of biofilm on the damaged surface. Therefore, different repair protocols have been proposed to enhance the esthetic, functionality, and longevity of the implant-supported prosthesis. Additionally, the success of the clinical cases depends on the capability to identify ceramic failures and the ability to indicate/perform the correct repair protocol. Since the described repair technique of the fractured screw-retained implant-supported prosthesis was a simple, easy, affordable, and minimally invasive treatment, with excellent esthetic and masticatory results, it represents an interesting clinical option.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34002718/

In total, 186 CRBFPDs in 153 patients were made from cobalt-chrome alloy. Panavia F 2.0 was used as a luting agent after air-abrasion. Restoration were evaluated at 3-month intervals with regard to function, esthetics, and possible complications.
CRBFPDs were evaluated after intervals of 12 to 40 months. The average clinical service time (i.e., length of time in situ at examination, including re-cementation after debonding) was 26.2 ± 13.6 months. Among these CRBFPDs, 87 (46.8%) were bridges in the maxilla, while 99 (53.2%) were bridges in the mandible. Most CRBFPDs (184, 98.9%) survived throughout the study period, while two (1.1%) were regarded as failed. The majority of debonded bridges had been used to replace the maxillary central incisor (60%).

Bilayer ceramic discs were made from zirconia blocks (IPS e.max Zircad MO, Ivoclar Vivadent - 0.7 mm thickness) and randomized into 8 groups (n= 15) according to two factors: 'zirconia surface treatment' (Control; Grinding - diamond bur; Air-abrasion - aluminum oxide particles; and Liner - application of a ceramic liner [IPS e.max Zirliner, Ivoclar Vivadent]); and 'thermocycling' (presence - 12,000 thermal cycles; 5-55ºC; or absence). The discs were veneered with porcelain (IPS e.max Ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent - 0.7 mm; totaling 1.4 mm thickness) according to ISO 6872:2015 for biaxial flexure strength testing. Fatigue tests (step-stress approach; 20 to 100 MPa; step of 10 MPa; 10,000 cycles per step; 10 Hz frequency) were run, followed by the data analysis (Kaplan-Meier and Mantel-Cox post-hoc tests). Analysis of roughness, topography, crystallographic phase arranges and fractography were also executed.
The surface treatment and thermocycling did not influence the porcelain crack nor delamination resistance. When only comparing the surface treatments for crack resistance outcome, the liner application depicted the worst fatigue performance in comparison to grinding and air-abrasion, while all groups were similar for delamination.
Neither the surface treatment of the zirconia nor the thermocycling influences the porcelain crack resistance or the resistance to delamination of the bilayer porcelain-veneered zirconia specimens.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33028796/

Pit and fissure sealants are one of the best methods of preventing caries as it occludes the fissures and pits from the accumulation of plaque and cariogenic microflora. There are different methods of cleaning and preparing occlusal pits and fissures for preventing caries which helps in alleviating oral health status of paediatric population.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the microleakage of pit and fissure sealants after using five different preparation techniques, namely: A) Conventional technique using pumice prophylaxis, B) enameloplasty with round carbide bur, C) enameloplasty with fissurotomy bur, D) air polisher, and E) air abrasion.
The study was conducted on 50 caries-free premolars extracted for orthodontic purpose. These teeth were randomly assigned to five groups, 10 teeth in each for receiving fissure sealant after different surface preparation; thermocycling and sectioning of samples were performed and microleakage was assessed under a stereomicroscope after methylene blue dye immersion.
The results of air abrasion groups were significantly superior with ""0"" microleakage when compared to all other groups followed by round bur, fissurotomy bur, air polisher and pumice prophylaxis.
To improve the marginal adaptation of the sealants, minimally invasive methods are the most favoured methods of occlusal preparation. This study promises to show positive results for fissure sealants which are likely to play an important role in caries prevention and techniques that are intended to protect caries susceptible surfaces.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32436905/
