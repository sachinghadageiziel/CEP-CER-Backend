40255479,The effect of surface treatments on the bond strength of polyetheretherketone posts: a systematic review protocol.,F1000Research,2024,"Boukhris H, Ben Hadj Khalifa A, Hajjami H, Boudegga Ben Youssef S","Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is widely used in the biomedical field due to its outstanding biological and mechanical properties. Originally employed as a temporary abutment in implantology, recent research has expanded its indications for more definitive applications, such as frameworks and dental post and core. However, PEEK's inert nature and low surface energy pose challenges for adhesion, necessitating surface modifications. Various physical and chemical modification techniques, including acid etching (e.g., 98% sulfuric acid), sandblasting with alumina oxide (Al₂O₃), plasma treatment, laser irradiation, silanization, and air abrasion with silica-coated particles, have been proposed to enhance PEEK's bonding performance. Despite numerous clinical investigations, standardized protocols for surface treatment remain lacking. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of surface treatments on the bonding performance of PEEK posts.
A detailed search of the literature will be conducted across several databases including PubMed, Scopus and clinical trial registries. Additional databases such as Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Web of Science and EBSCO will also be included. The search strategy will target controlled randomized studies and non-randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of surface treatments on PEEK post adhesion strength. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) will be used to assess bias in non-randomized studies, while the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB II) tool will be employed for evaluating randomized controlled trials. Data extraction will focus on study design, treatment methods, outcomes and results.This systematic review protocol will adhere to the guidelines for systematic reviews outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).
The discussion will explore the implications of findings on clinical practice, highlighting the importance of enhancing PEEK's bioactivity and surface energy to improve bonding efficacy in dental procedures. Moreover, it will suggest areas for future research to advance dental materials science, aiming to optimize the utilization of PEEK in dental applications.

Hemostatic agents may adversely affect the bonding procedure, thus their removal prior to bonding is essential. The current study evaluates the effect of two hemostatic agents and different dentin cleansing protocols on the shear bond strength of resin composite to dentin using a universal adhesive.
Ninety premolars were sectioned to expose coronal dentinal surfaces which were divided into 3 groups: control group, not treated with hemostatic agent (n = 10); a group treated with Viscostat ""20% ferric sulphate"" (n = 40); and a group treated with Viscostat clear ""25% aluminum chloride"" (n = 40). The groups treated with hemostatic agents were subdivided into 4 subgroups according to the cleansing protocol: water, phosphoric acid, katana cleaner, and air abrasion. Shear bond strength (SBS) of resin composite bonded to the treated dentin using a universal adhesive was measured after thermocycling.
Two-way ANOVA showed that hemostatic agent, cleansing protocol and their interaction has significant effect on SBS (p < 0.0001). Viscostat (10 ± 3.3 MPa) exhibited lower SBS than Viscostat Clear (16.2 ± 5.5 MPa). Acid etching (17.3 ± 7.3 MPa) showed higher SBS compared to Katana Cleaner (12.6 ± 4.7 MPa), water (12.1 ± 4.8 MPa) and air abrasion (10.8 ± 2 MPa).
The use of hemostatic agents can adversely affect the bond strength of universal adhesives to dentin. Phosphoric acid provided the best hemostatic agent-cleansing protocol while katana cleaner and air abrasion demonstrated inferior results.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39568011/

With the rising number of adult orthodontic patients, many present with zirconia crowns. This study aimed to evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) of ceramic orthodontic brackets bonded to transition dental zirconia, which combines 3Y-TZP and 5Y-TZP powders.
Ninety zirconia substrates were divided into three groups (n=30) based on transition zirconia brands (3M ESPE Lava™ Plus, Cercon® ht ML, and Katana™ Zirconia UTML) and bonded with ceramic brackets (CHIC Ceramic Roth Maxillary and Symetri Clear) using 3M™ Transbond™ XT. A control group used traditional zirconia and metal brackets. Surface treatments included 50-micron aluminium oxide abrasion and Z-Prime™ Plus application. SBS was tested post-thermocycling. Adhesive Resin Index (ARI) was scored and surface roughness was evaluated pre- and post-bonding.
Group 1 (3M ESPE Lava™ Plus with CHIC Ceramic Roth Maxillary brackets) had a significantly lower SBS (mean 13.27MPa) compared to the other groups, which all had SBS values above 18.80MPa (P≤.023). Group 2 (3M ESPE Lava™ Plus with Symetri™ Clear) demonstrated a significantly higher mean ARI compared to the control group (Cercon® XT with Victory Series™ Roth), (P=.027). Additionally, significant changes in surface roughness were observed in Groups B (Cercon® ht ML) (P=.008) and C (Katana™ Zirconia UTML) (P=.016).
This study determined that the shear bond strength of various transitional zirconia substrates with ceramic brackets exceeded the clinically acceptable SBS levels. The combination of 3M ESPE Lava™ Plus and Symetri™ Clear exhibited significant variation in ARI. Additionally, significant surface irregularities were observed in 3M ESPE Lava™ Plus and Cercon® ht ML following air abrasion, compared to other transitional zirconia brands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39515181/

This review explores the origins of BRD, introduces cognitive biases influencing the adoption of BRD protocols without evidence scrutiny, and discusses nine BRD protocols. For this, we searched randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews in the literature on the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library CENTRAL databases, which lead to the following conclusions about the revised protocols: 1) The use of dyes excessively removes carious dentin; 2) Aluminum oxide air abrasion contributes to overtreatment and may pose long-term health risks to dental professionals; 3) Beveling enamel in posterior teeth is technically difficult and leads to unnecessary loss of adjacent sound enamel with no evidence of its use outperforming butt-joint preparations; 4) Deactivating matrix metalloproteinases with chlorhexidine shows no clinical evidence of improving restoration longevity. 5) ""Elected"" gold-standard adhesive systems perform no better than other good performing available systems; 6) Immediate dentin sealing and resin coating result in similar post-operative sensitivity and longevity of indirect fillings as delayed dentin sealing; 7) Deep margin elevation is a viable alternative to manage subgingival margins in occlusoproximal cavities; 8) The process of ""decoupling"" with time lacks scientific evidence to support its use; 9) Placing fiber inserts on the pulpal floor and/or axial wall to minimize stress offers no benefits over current alternatives. In conclusion, more rigorous research is needed to validate BRD protocols, focusing on important clinical outcomes that impact in the longevity of the restoration, such as fracture, debonding, post-operative sensitivity, esthetic quality, presence of caries lesions adjacent to restorations and patients' satisfaction need to be thoroughly investigated. Reliance on anecdotal evidence, clinical experience, and common sense propagates myths and undervalues the need for a critical approach in evaluating dental techniques.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39476015/
39374733,Is zirconia surface etching a viable alternative to airborne particle abrasion? A systematic review and meta-analysis of in vitro studies.,Journal of dentistry,2024,"D'Alessandro C, Josic U, Mazzitelli C, Maravic T, Graham L, Barausse C, Mazzoni A, Breschi L, Blatz MB","This systematic review aimed to determine the effectiveness of various etching surface treatments on zirconia bond strength with the following research question: ""Can zirconia etching serve as a viable alternative to airborne particle abrasion (APA) for achieving reliable bonding?"".
In vitro studies comparing APA, performed with either conventional or silica-coated aluminum oxide (Al
A comprehensive literature search was conducted across electronic databases, including Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus and ProQuest.
Fifty-four relevant articles were included in this systematic review. According to the QUIN's tool, 7 studies were rated as ""high risk of bias"", 46 studies were rated as ""medium risk"", and 1 study was rated as ""low risk"". Nineteen studies were used for meta-analyses. Mostly, APA demonstrated significantly higher bond strength compared to various etching protocols (p < 0.05). However, no statistical difference was found between APA and high concentrations (40-48 %) of hydrofluoric acid (HF) in terms of immediate- and medium-term bond strength to resin composite (p > 0.05). On enamel, an experimental hot etching solution performed significantly better than APA in short-term follow-up (p < 0.05). A novel multi-acid solution exhibited significantly higher immediate shear bond strength to resin cement than APA (p < 0.05). Variable heterogeneity, ranging from low to high, was observed.
APA remains the surface treatment with the strongest evidence in the literature and it is usually more efficacious than zirconia etching. However, highly concentrated HF and an experimental hot etching solution have demonstrated similar or significantly higher bond strength values over time compared to APA, depending on the adhesive substrate. A recently introduced multi-acid solution (Zircos-E) needs to be further explored, especially in regards to long-term bond durability.
This systematic review provides a comprehensive analysis of the existing in vitro evidence on the potential of zirconia etching and the bond durability of resin-based materials after artificial aging. Selecting appropriate surface treatment protocols is crucial for achieving optimal clinical outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374733/

The highest mean of shear bond strength values was demonstrated in Group of air abrasion with primer application using conventional resin cement (APB) (12.21 ± 2.14 MPa). Sulfuric acid groups showed lower shear bond strength values and the majority failed in thermocycling especially when no primer was applied. The failure mode analysis showed that the predominant failure type was adhesive failure between cement and PEEK, while the remaining was mixed failure between cement and PEEK.
The air abrasion followed by primer application and conventional resin cement used for bonding Lithium Disilicate to PEEK achieved the best bond strength. Primer application did not have an effect when self-adhesive resin cement was used in air-abraded groups.

[et al.],2024,"Bayraktar N, Harorli OT","This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different surface treatments on the repair bond strength between a fiber-reinforced dentin composite and a posterior composite.
Forty fiber-reinforced dentin composite resin blocks (4 mm × 4 mm × 4 mm) were separated into eight groups (n = 5) according to the surface preparation methods: (G1) negative control group, (G2) adhesive application, (G3) 50% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) application, (G4) 50% DMSO + adhesive application, (G5) 37% phosphoric acid etch + adhesive application, (G6) air abrasion + adhesive application, (G7) 37% phosphoric acid etch + 50% DMSO application + adhesive application, and (G8) air abrasion +50% DMSO application + adhesive application group. The composite surfaces were repaired in two layers with a posterior composite. Composite sticks were subjected to a micro tensile bond strength (μTBS) test. Fractured surfaces were evaluated using a stereomicroscope (×25). Short fiber-reinforced composite samples' surfaces were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Shapiro Wilk, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey HSD tests were used for statistical evaluation.
The highest average (μTBS) values were observed in G8, whereas the lowest mean μTBS values were evident in the G1 group. Statistically significant μTBS values were found in all adhesive-applied groups when compared with the negative control group. Notably, the application of 50% DMSO without adhesive did not lead to a statistically significant increase in μTBS values. SEM images demonstrated that acid etching partially eliminated residues on the composite surface, while air abrasion had a detrimental effect on the integrity of fiber structures.
In the repair of fiber-reinforced dentin composite with a posterior composite, adhesive application is an effective approach. The treatment of 50% DMSO without adhesive did not confer a statistically significant advantage, and the supplemental use of acid etch or air abrasion did not show an additional benefit compared to adhesive-only repairs.
Adhesive application emerges as a potent and effective strategy for the repair of bur-roughened fiber-reinforced dentin composites.

Exclusion criteria include primary teeth, air abrasion of a substrate other than sound dentin, use of particles apart from aluminum oxide or bioactive glass, and studies in which bond strength was not assessed.
Out of the 1023 records, title and abstract screening resulted in the exclusion of 895 and 67 studies, respectively, while full-text analysis excluded another 25 articles. In addition, 5 records were not included, as full texts could not be obtained after requesting the authors. Two cross-references were added. Thus, 33 studies were included in this review. It is important to emphasize the absence of standardization of air abrasion parameters. According to 63.6% of the studies, air abrasion does not influence dentin bond strength. Moreover, 30.3% suggest improving bonding performance, and 6.1% advocate a decrease.
Air abrasion with aluminum oxide does not enhance or impair dentin bond strength. The available data on bioactive glass are limited, which hinders conclusive insights.

In conclusion, HF+UA is an effective surface treatment for PICN, while the combination AB+HF+SI+UA was more appropriate for ZLS. The water storage for one year reduced the SBS for most groups.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36533364/

An unrestricted search of indexed databases was performed with the following eligibility criteria: (a) human fluorotic teeth (experimental-group); (b) human teeth without fluorosis (control-group); (c) studies using phosphoric acid (PA) etching without air abrasion (AA), PA etching combined with AA, and application of self-etching primer (SEP) alone as bonding interventions/techniques and (d) measuring SBS in megapascals (MPa). Data screening, selection and extraction were performed by two reviewers. The risk of bias (rob) was assessed using the JBI Critical appraisal tool for Quasi-Experimental Studies. Meta-analyses were performed using a random effects model. The quality of available evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Ten in vitro studies were included. Subgroup analyses were performed for each intervention type. The SBS was significantly lower in fluorotic teeth when PA was used without AA (mean difference = 3.26 MPa, confidence interval: [1.00, 5.52]); and there were no significant differences for the PA combined with AA and SEP interventions. All studies had a low rob. The overall level of evidence was at best low. The SBS is lower in teeth with EF when traditional PA is used. No significant differences were found in SBS between teeth with and without EF when PA is used with AA or when SEP is used alone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35960660/

Ninety-nine zirconia specimens were prepared and divided into 3 groups: control (with no surface treatment); and pre-sintered and sintered groups with surface treatment. Surface treatment was applied before sintering in the pre-sintered group and after sintering in the sintered group. After following all protocols, a resin cement was layered on the zirconia surface. Shear bond strength was measured using a universal testing machine. The results were subjected to the statistical analysis. The surface topography and phase transformation of zirconia were evaluated using the atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses after surface treatment.
The laser irradiation (3 W, 1 W and 2 W) of the pre-sintered zirconia surface resulted in the highest SBS values (p < 0.001), while the lowest SBS values were obtained with airborne particle abrasion of the pre-sintered and sintered zirconia surfaces.
Laser irradiation increased the SBS of pre-sintered zirconia to a resin cement. Surface treatment with air abrasion had a lesser effect on the SBS values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34978766/
34678740,Microshear bond strength of resin luting agents to monolithic zirconia.,General dentistry,2021,"Imbery TA, Seekford K, Naeem O, Janus C, Moon PC","The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different surface treatments on the microshear bond strength (μSBS) of resin cements to zirconia. Twenty-four zirconia wafers measuring 2.0 × 9.0 × 15.0 mm were sintered and randomly distributed into 3 groups based on the resin cement (n = 8): Panavia F 2.0, NX3, and RelyX Ultimate. The resin cement groups were divided into 4 subgroups based on the surface treatment: a control subgroup (air abrasion with 50-μm alumina particles) and 3 experimental surface treatments (Alloy Primer, Ea-Z-y Primer, and tribochemical silicoating using CoJet Sand). Each surface treatment was applied to the zirconia wafers according to its manufacturer's instructions. The resin cements were mixed and placed in thermoplastic tubes, producing cylinders measuring 0.8 mm in diameter × 2.0 mm in height. Five tubes containing the resin cements were placed on each of the pretreated zirconia wafers, resulting in a sample size of 10 specimens per treatment per resin cement. The luting agents were allowed to cure chemically for 4 minutes and then light cured for 30 seconds. The thermoplastic tubes were removed after 24 hours, and specimens were stored in deionized water (37°C) for 24 hours. A shear force was applied using a wire loop attached to a universal testing machine with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min, and the microshear forces required for failure were recorded. The parametric data were analyzed with a 2-way analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey and Dunnett tests (P < 0.05). The mean (SD) μSBS values ranged from 3.6 (0.9) to 9.3 (2.4) MPa. Surface treatment with Alloy Primer and Ea-Z-y Primer increased the μSBS of the 3 cements compared to their controls, but the difference was not always statistically significant. CoJet Sand only increased the μSBS of Panavia F 2.0. The results suggest that the effects of different surface treatments may be specific for each cement.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34678740/

The analysis includes the cytotoxicity of the powders and their effect on odontogenic gene expression.
Sound human dentine specimens were air-abraded using bioglass 45S5 (BAG), polycarboxylated zinc-doped bioglass (SEL), alumina (AL) and submitted to SEM analysis. Resin composite was bonded to air-abraded or smear layer-covered dentine (SML) using an experimental (EXP) or a commercial adhesive (ABU) in etch&rinse (ER) or self-etch (SE) modes. Specimens were stored in artificial saliva (AS) and subjected to MTBS testing after 24 h and 10 months. Interfacial nanoleakage assessment was accomplished using confocal microscopy. The cytotoxicity of the powders was assessed, also the total RNA was extracted and the expression of odontogenic genes was evaluated through RT-PCR.
After prolonged AS storage, specimens in the control (SML) and AL groups showed a significant drop in MTBS (p > 0.05), with degradation evident within the bonding interface. Specimens in BAG or SEL air-abraded dentine groups showed no significant difference, with resin-dentine interfaces devoid of important degradation. The metabolic activity of pulp stem cells was not affected by the tested powders. SEL and BAG had no effect on the expression of odontoblast differentiation markers. However, AL particles interfered with the expression of the odontogenic markers.
The use of bioactive glass air-abrasion may prevent severe degradation at the resin-dentine interface. Unlike alumina, bioactive glasses do not interfere with the normal metabolic activity of pulp stem cells and their differentiation to odontoblasts.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34561100/

One hundred twelve composite resin blocks were formed using a nanohybrid composite resin. The samples were distributed into four groups according to surface preparation methods (n = 28): control (sound composite blocks); Er, Cr: YSGG laser; air abrasion; silicone carbide. All samples were then divided into four subgroups according to various aging periods: (i) No aging, (ii) 10,000 thermocycling, (iii) 30,000 thermocycling, and (iv) 50,000 thermocycling. Following surface preparation and aging procedures, surface topography of one sample from each group was evaluated under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The repair composites were bonded to the sample surfaces, using a three-step etch&rinse adhesive. Finally, thirty beams of size 1 × 1 × 8 mm from each group were subjected to μTBS test and failure modes were determined. The data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA, Post-hoc Bonferroni, and Chi-square tests (P = 0.05).
When different surface preparation methods were evaluated together, no aging and 10,000 thermocycling groups displayed higher μTBS values (P < 0.05). When all aging periods were evaluated together, the surface preparation with air abrasion provided higher μTBS (P < 0.05). The interactions of various aging periods with different surface preparation methods revealed significant variations in repair μTBS (P < 0.05). There were statistically significant differences on failure mode distributions among surface preparation methods (P < 0.001). SEM evaluations provided valuable outcomes that help to comment on the μTBS findings.

The objective of the study was to compare the in vivo clinical failure rate and the in vitro rebond strength of bonded brackets following two enamel surface preparation methods.
For the in vitro study, 45 extracted human premolars were etched; brackets were bonded using light-cured composite resin. Forty-five premolars were divided into three groups (15 in each group): the initial bonding group (IB group), the rebonding group in which enamel was reconditioned using sandblasting before acid etching (SBE group), and the rebonding group in which enamel was reconditioned using acid etching only (E group). For the in vivo study, 80 premolars in 20 patients (13-18 years old) were rebonded using the same procedures in the SBE group and E group. The two methods were used in all patients using a split-mouth design. The number of failing brackets was quantified over 6 months. Differences were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc tests.
The mean shear bond strength for the IB, SBE, and E groups was 19.38, 22.37, and 17.31 MPa, respectively. A significant difference was observed in the bond strength of the three evaluated groups (P < 0.001). The differences in the bond strength were significant between the IB group and the SBE group, as well as between the SBE group and the E group. The clinical failure rate for bonded brackets was 10% in the SBE group, and 25% in the E group and this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001).
Reconditioning of enamel surfaces using both intraoral air abrasion and etching in the rebonding process led to higher rebond strength than using acid etching alone and even higher than the initial brackets bonding.

Retainer wires of 15 mm segments were used, PEEK wires were prepared in cylindrical form with 0.8 mm diameter, and had two surface treatments namely air-abrasion and conditioning with adhesive system. Three different metallic retainer wires were used for comparison and three tests were performed; two tests measured debonding force and associated wire deflection from acrylic blocks and bovine teeth and one test for pull-out force. To test debonding force, a vertically directed compressive force was applied to the retainer wires bonded to the acrylic blocks and bovine teeth, while for pull-out test; a vertically directed tensile force detached the retainer wire.
In both debonding tests, PEEK wires (regardless the surface treatment) had non-significant difference when compared to each other, or to the other metallic wires, except the dead-soft coaxial wire group. The dead-soft coaxial wire group had significant difference when compared to other groups regarding both the force magnitude and maximum deflection, the only exception was the debonding force of the flat braided retainer wires bonded to bovine teeth. In pull-out test PEEK wires conditioned with adhesive system and the air-abraded recorded the second and third highest readings respectively.
Within the limitations of this study, the 0.8 mm round PEEK wires have comparable performance-in terms of debonding and pull out forces-to conventional retainers when bonded with 4 mm composite bonding spots; using air-abrasion for 10 s at 3.5 MPa provided sufficient adhesion of the composite to the wire, and conditioning with adhesive system may provide no further clinical benefit.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33314768/

Lingual surfaces of 30 human teeth were sandblasted with 2 different distances: 1, 2mm and 3 different durations: 1, 2, 3s and photographed using a light microscope. The cavity depth and diameter of the sandblasted teeth were measured on the light microscope's pictures. A pilot study was performed to minimize possible combinations of sandblasting durations and distances. To validate the measurement method, sandblasted teeth were ground cut for comparison. Inter-examiner reliability was assessed with Bland-Altman analysis. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to detect cavity and diameter changes for every sandblasting duration and NTD combination.
From the pilot study sandblasting durations 1,2 and 3s and NTD<2mm were chosen. The cavity diameter of the sandblasted area did not change with increased sandblasting duration nor NTD (P>0.05). The cavity depth of the sandblasted area increased statistically with an increased sandblasting duration (P<0.05) but did not increase with an increase NTD (P>0.05). The 95% limits of inter-examiner agreement were narrow.
All distance and duration combinations tested caused enamel damage. Sandblasting duration had greater impact on the cavity depth than the NTD. The blasting duration should, therefore, not exceed 2s and the NTD should be held at maximum 2mm to minimize the risk of unintentional spread.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33093007/

Bilayer ceramic discs were made from zirconia blocks (IPS e.max Zircad MO, Ivoclar Vivadent - 0.7 mm thickness) and randomized into 8 groups (n= 15) according to two factors: 'zirconia surface treatment' (Control; Grinding - diamond bur; Air-abrasion - aluminum oxide particles; and Liner - application of a ceramic liner [IPS e.max Zirliner, Ivoclar Vivadent]); and 'thermocycling' (presence - 12,000 thermal cycles; 5-55ºC; or absence). The discs were veneered with porcelain (IPS e.max Ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent - 0.7 mm; totaling 1.4 mm thickness) according to ISO 6872:2015 for biaxial flexure strength testing. Fatigue tests (step-stress approach; 20 to 100 MPa; step of 10 MPa; 10,000 cycles per step; 10 Hz frequency) were run, followed by the data analysis (Kaplan-Meier and Mantel-Cox post-hoc tests). Analysis of roughness, topography, crystallographic phase arranges and fractography were also executed.
The surface treatment and thermocycling did not influence the porcelain crack nor delamination resistance. When only comparing the surface treatments for crack resistance outcome, the liner application depicted the worst fatigue performance in comparison to grinding and air-abrasion, while all groups were similar for delamination.

In this systematic review the authors investigated how airborne-particle abrasion (APA) using aluminum oxide affects the bond strength of resin-based materials to dentin. The search was performed in three databases. In vitro studies (Type of study) comparing the bond strength of resin-based materials (Outcome) to air-abraded (Intervention) compared with non-air-abraded (Comparison) human dentin (Population) were included (the PICOT elements are given parenthetically). From 5437 unique articles, 65 were read in full, 33 were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 32 were included in the meta-analysis. Methodologic quality and risk of bias were assessed. Comparisons were performed between air-abraded and control dentin groups by adopting a random-effects model (α=0.05). Additional analyses were carried out for the different parameters used in APA: type of surface treatment in the control group, particle size, air pressure, and APA duration. The bond strength to air-abraded dentin was favored only when the control surface was treated with a hand excavator. For particle size, APA was favored when the particle size was >30 μm and the controls were no treatment or hand excavator or when the particle size was ≤30 μm and the control was bur. In addition, the results favored air-abraded groups only when the pressure was > 5 bar and bur was used in the control group. No significant differences were observed for duration of APA. No comparison on bond strength considering the presence of aging conditions was possible in the included studies due to the low number of studies that aged the specimens. In conclusion, APA had no negative effects on the bond strength of resin-based materials to dentin and was able to improve the dentin bond strength only when the particle size was > 30 μm and air pressure was > 5 bar.

Substrate groups consisting of thirty-six lithium disilicate (e.max® CAD) samples and thirty-six lithium silicate infused with zirconia (CELTRA® DUO) samples were fabricated to replicate the facial surface of a left maxillary central incisor. The surface of all samples was prepared with an aluminium oxide air abrasion etchant protocol. Each substrate group was split into three test groups (n=12). Each test group was bonded using a different brand of ceramic orthodontic bracket. Shear bond strength (SBS) testing was conducted and the mean SBS values for each group were calculated and recorded in MPa. An Adhesive Resin Index (ARI) score was also assigned to each sample to assess the location of bond failure.
Mean SBS of the e.max® CAD groups were significantly less than the CELTRA® DUO groups. Symetri brackets showed significantly higher shear bond strengths to both substrates than both of the other brackets tested. ARI scores of the e.max® CAD groups were significantly less than the CELTRA® DUO groups.
