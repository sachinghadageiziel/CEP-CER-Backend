40156530,Effect of Selective Dentine Pre-Treatment with Butane Tetracarboxylic Acid on Composite-Dentine Bond.,Indian journal of dental research : official publication of Indian Society for Dental Research,2024,"Sharma N, Susila A, Veronica AK, Fiona RJ, Sai S, Anguswamy S","Composites are prone to time-dependent bond degradation. Many measures have been taken to stabilize the bond.
This in vitro study aims to evaluate the effect of pretreatment with 1,2,3,4-Butane Tetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) on the micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) of composite resin to dentine and to compare it with the pretreatment using 2% chlorhexidine (CHX).
Permanent molars (40) extracted for periodontal reasons were selected. Dentine surfaces were exposed using a diamond bur, preconditioned with BTCA for the test group (SIGMA-ALDRICH) and with CHX for the control group, followed by the application of self-etch adhesive (GC G-Premio bond) and composite restoration (GC Solare X). Each group was subdivided to be tested as: Group 1A: after 24 hours with BTCA; Group 1B: after 1 month with BTCA; Group 2A: after 24 hours with CHX; Group 2B: after 1 month with CHX. The µTBS was tested using a universal testing machine. The mode of failure was determined using a stereomicroscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM).
BTCA pretreatment was able to preserve the bond slightly better than the control group, though not statistically significant either at 24 hours (P = 0.492) or 1 month (P = 0.181). There was no significant reduction in the µTBS between immediate testing and 1-month storage for both groups (P = 0.213 for acid; P = 0.914 for CHX). The mode of failure was predominantly cohesive for both groups, with fewer adhesive failures.
BTCA pre-conditioning is capable of preserving the dentin-composite bond as efficiently as CHX.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40156530/

The bond strength to core and repairing materials is crucial in the restoration's longevity. This systematic review evaluates the shear bond strength (SBS) of CAD-CAM-LD restorative materials to other materials using different surface treatments.
An electronic literature search was performed through PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Studies were selected based on specific criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies.
Eleven studies were included, primarily investigating composite resin as the repair material. SBS values ranged from 0.82 to 32.96MPa, with the highest values observed for IPS e.max-CAD subjected to silicon carbide polishing, hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching, and silane application. For core materials, the highest SBS was reported for HFtreated IPS e.max-CAD bonded to tribochemically coated titanium and air-abraded zirconia, with SBS values ranging from 5.88 to 34MPa.
This review indicates that HF etching combined with silane application is the most effective method for improving bond strength in CAD/CAM-LD restorations. Applying surface treatments to both the core material and CAD/CAM-LD can further enhance bond strength.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39607319/
39506335,The Effect of Implantoplasty on Fracture Resistance and Implant Surface Changes: An In Vitro and Finite Element Analysis Study.,Clinical implant dentistry and related research,2025,"Goh R, Li KC, Atieh MA, Ma S, Oliver A, Giraldo D, Tawse-Smith A","Implantoplasty can be performed on implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis to facilitate implant decontamination and improve access for oral home care. However, its effect on the mechanical strength of the implant is still uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of implantoplasty on the fracture resistance of dental implants with various degrees of bone loss, as well as its surface changes.
Eighty 4.2 × 13 mm conical connection dental implants were allocated evenly into four groups based on the bone defect morphology: circumferential or semi-circumferential, and 3 or 5 mm vertical height. Half of the implants underwent implantoplasty with tungsten carbide finishing burs. Weight, volume, and surface roughness of the implants were recorded prior to and after instrumentation. All implants were subjected to static loading to failure or fracture and the implant surfaces were then analyzed using optical microscopy. Finite element analysis was carried out to assess the stress pattern on dental implants after implantoplasty.
Implantoplasty significantly reduced the fracture resistance of implants with all defect morphologies, aside from those with 3 mm of circumferential bone loss. Implants with 5 mm of peri-implant bone loss also experienced significantly reduced fracture resistance compared to the 3 mm group. Significant decrease in fracture resistance was only observed between the circumferential and semi-circumferential groups with 5 mm of bone loss. Surface roughness was also significantly reduced following implantoplasty. The results from finite element analysis revealed a change in pattern of stress concentration in the implant after implantoplasty.
Implantoplasty negatively impacted the fracture resistance of standard diameter dental implants in most scenarios. The increase in exposed implant length resulted in a decrease in fracture resistance. This increase in fracture risk should be considered prior to implantoplasty, especially in implants with more advanced bone loss.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39506335/
38957913,Complete versus incomplete caries removal procedures and their effects on dental pulp in primary teeth - An in vivo study.,Journal of the Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry,2024,"Vaghasiya J, Mittal S, Choudhari SR, Rishitha N","Dental caries results from an ecologic shift within the dental biofilm from a balanced population of microorganisms to an acidogenic, aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population developed and maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary carbohydrates. Total caries removal (TCR) of deep lesion may result in pulpal exposure requiring more invasive treatment. Hence, current pediatric dentistry has shifted to minimally invasive treatment that avoids more complex, time-consuming procedure, and the child's discomfort.
The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare clinical performance and radiographic changes after complete and incomplete caries removal procedures.
The study was conducted on 60 primary molars in children aged 6-9 years. Selected 60 primary molars were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 (PCR): infected dentin was removed, while the affected dentin was maintained on the pulpal wall. Group 2 (TCR): both infected and affected dentin were removed through low-speed carbide bur and hand excavator. Teeth were evaluated at 4 and 6 months clinically and radiographically.
The proportion was compared using Fisher's exact test. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 21 was used for analysis. The level of significance was kept at 5%.
The clinical and radiographic success rates of ICR and CCR in primary teeth with deep carious lesions were high and did not differ significantly, indicating that the retention of carious dentin does not interfere with pulp vitality. Thus, ICR is a reliable minimally invasive approach that might replace the CCR in primary teeth when correctly indicated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38957913/

Human Gingival Fibroblasts (HGF-1) response during the early phase of healing could vary according to the procedures employed to cure the dental composite. Moreover, oxygen diffusion into dental composite inhibits the polymerization reaction, creating an oxygen-inhibited layer (OIL) that presents residual unreacted monomers. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of different polishing techniques and OIL on HGF-1.
Composite discs polished with different techniques (diamond rubber, abrasive discs and tungsten carbide burr) were used. An additional not polished smooth group obtained with and without OIL was used as control. Samples were physically characterized through the analysis of their hydrophilicity and surface topography through contact angle measurement and SEM, respectively; afterwards the biologic response of HGF-1 when cultured on the different substrates was analyzed in terms of cytotoxicity and gene expression.
The finishing systems caused alterations to the wettability, even if without a proportional relation towards the results of the proliferation essay, from which emerges a greater proliferation on surfaces polished with one-step diamond rubber and with abrasive discs as well as a direct effect of the glycerin layer, confirming that surface roughness can heavily influence the biological response of HGF-1.
Surfaces wettability as well as cellular behavior seem to be affected by the selection of the finishing system used to lastly shape the restoration. Especially, the presence of OIL act as a negative factor in the regards of human gingival fibroblasts. The present study may provide the first clinical instruction regarding the best polishing system of composite material when the restoration is placed directly in contact with soft tissue cells. Understanding HGF-1 behavior can help identifying the polishing treatment for direct restoration of carious/non-carious cervical lesions associated with gingival recessions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38831398/
38801940,Effect of layer thickness and polishing on wear resistance of additively manufactured occlusal splints.,Journal of dentistry,2024,"Diken Türksayar AA, Diker B","To evaluate the effect of polishing and layering thickness on the wear resistance of 3D-printed occlusal splint materials.
Specimens with 3 different layer thicknesses (50, 75, 100 µm) were produced in the form of a disc 3 mm thick using V-Print splint resin on a 3D-printer with digital light processing technology. (n = 16 for each thickness) All specimens were washed and cured according to the manufacturer's instructions. Half of the specimens of each layer thickness were polished with silicon carbide papers. All specimens were subjected to 120.000 cycles of a chewing simulator for 2-body wear tests. Before and after the wear test, the specimens were scanned with a laser scanner, and the images were overlaid using a 3D analysis program and the volume loss was calculated. The wear patterns of the specimens were examined under a scanning electron microscope. Statistical evaluation was performed using a Shapiro-Wilk test, 2-way ANOVA, 1-way ANOVA, and Tukey post hoc test (α = 0.05).
While polishing had a significant effect (p = 0.003) on the wear volume of the occlusal splints, layer thickness (p = 0.105) and their interaction between polishing and layer thickness (p = 0.620) did not significantly affect the wear volume. Regardless of the polishing, the lowest mean wear was observed for D50 (0.064 mm
The polished 3D-printed occlusal splint resin showed higher wear resistance than the unpolished one, regardless of the layer thickness.
Since different layer thicknesses of 50 µm and greater had no effect on the wear resistance of the material, a layer thickness of 100 µm may be preferred for faster printing. However, polishing occlusal splints may reduce the amount of wear and improve clinical performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38801940/

One hundred and fifty patients diagnosed with reversible pulpitis with deep carious lesions were included in this study. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups (n=50), Group C: CEM group, Group M: MTA group, and Group D: CH (Dycal) group. After caries removal by mechanical excavation except for one carious spot, the removal of which resulted in the exposure of the pulp, the final carious spot was removed with a sterile no.2 round carbide bur. After haemostasis, the pulpal wound was dressed by a capping agent, followed immediately by permanent restoration. Patients were assessed for successful outcomes based on positive vitality tests, absence of clinical signs and symptoms, and PAI scores after 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18-month follow-up periods. The ANOVA test was employed to analyse quantitative variables, and the Pearson Chi-square test was used for qualitative variables. A Bonferroni Test was employed as the post hoc test for intergroup comparison. The significance level was set at p≤0.05 within all tests.
The percentage of success in Group C was 86.7%, Group M was 77.3%, and Group D was 57.9%. This study's overall success rate after direct pulp capping of deep carious lesions was 74.8%. A statistically significant difference in PAI score was found between Groups C and D. Pain on percussion and response to vitality tests also showed significant differences among the three groups at the one-month follow-up.
CEM cement had comparable efficacy to MTA and was superior to CH in maintaining pulpal vitality following DPC in teeth with reversible pulpitis. An overall success rate of 74.8% indicated that DPC in deep carious lesions with reversible pulpitis could yield favourable clinical outcomes.

35993933,Do composite resin polishing systems damage enamel?,General dentistry,2022,"Ristau BS, Hamilton BN, Hill AE, Tantbirojn D, Versluis A","Finishing and polishing of composite resin restorations may cause damage to the bordering enamel. Although many studies have investigated the effect of polish on restorative materials, few have quantified the effect on bordering enamel. The objective of this study was to compare enamel loss surrounding composite restorations after finishing and polishing sequences. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in enamel loss between different finishing and polishing sequences. Class V preparations on the buccal and lingual surfaces of 15 extracted human molars were restored with a composite resin and assigned to 1 of 2 finishing and polishing sequences, so that each tooth underwent both sequences (n = 15 per sequence). In sequence 1, a tungsten carbide finishing bur and aluminum oxide polishing discs were used; in sequence 2, a diamond finishing bur, aluminum oxide-impregnated finishing cup, and diamond-impregnated polishing cup were used. Tooth surfaces were scanned with an optical scanner after preparation, finishing, initial polishing, and final polishing. The finishing and polishing scans were aligned to the preparation scan using Cumulus software. The depth of enamel surface loss was calculated and statistically analyzed (α = 0.05; paired t test). Most enamel loss (mean [SD]) resulted from the finishing step with the tungsten carbide bur (51.8 [21.3] μm) or diamond bur (43.3 [12.6] μm). Each polishing step increased mean enamel loss by only a few microns. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 finishing and polishing sequences. The majority of enamel damage during finishing and polishing of composite resin restorations resulted from the finishing burs. Little enamel was removed by either of the tested composite resin polishing systems.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35993933/

Thus, this study aimed to assess the effects of different methods of residual adhesive removal after orthodontic bracket debonding on flexural strength, surface roughness, and phase transformation of high-translucent (HT) zirconia.
This in vitro study evaluated 72 bar-shaped HT zirconia specimens; 18 specimens were assigned to the control group. Metal brackets were bonded to the remaining specimens by resin cement. After bracket debonding, the residual adhesive on the surface of specimens was removed by three methods (n=18): a 30-flute tungsten-carbide (TC) bur at low speed, an ultrafine diamond bur at high speed, and Er:YAG laser irradiation. The surface roughness (Ra and Rz) was measured. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out, and the flexural strength was measured as well. Data were statistically analyzed (α=0.05).
Before polishing, all methods increased the Ra and Rz values (P<0.05) except for the diamond bur yielding a Rz value comparable to that of the control group. The Ra values of the test groups were comparable after polishing, and still higher than that of the control group (P<0.05).

With the passage of time, pollution has gradually affected people's daily lives, but the solution to pollution is far from achieving a better treatment effect. For the treatment of pollution, in addition to considering the treatment effect, it is also necessary to consider whether the treatment method will cause pollution and the cost of the treatment of the pollutants. As one of the lifelines of human survival, the land is also suffering from pollution. The impact of heavy metal pollution is particularly serious, and there is no better solution. Based on this, this paper proposes a curing agent based on sustainable remediation to solve the soil pollution of heavy metals. The main material is Basic oxygen furnace slag (BOFS), which has excellent social development characteristics in all aspects, and the raw materials are calcium carbide residue (CCR) and phosphogypsum (PG) to explore a more suitable curing agent. (consisting of BOFS, CCR, and PG, abbreviated as BCP). The experimental results in this paper show that the volume of pores and pores in the agglomerates are slightly reduced, and the content of curing agent is increased from 4 to 10%, while the corresponding volume is only reduced by 0.006 and 0.017 mL/g.

34370040,In Vivo Pulp Temperature Changes During Class V Cavity Preparation and Resin Composite Restoration in Premolars.,Operative dentistry,2021,"Zarpellon DC, Runnacles P, Maucoski C, Gross DJ, Coelho U, Rueggeberg FA, Arrais C","This in vivo study evaluated the influence of the sequence of all restorative steps during Class V preparation and restoration in human premolars on pulp temperature (PT).
Intact premolars with orthodontic extraction indication of 13 volunteers received infiltrative anesthesia and isolation with rubber dam. An occlusal preparation was made with a high-speed diamond bur under air-water spray until the pulp was minimally exposed, then a thermocouple probe was inserted within the pulp. A deep, 2.0-mm depth Class V preparation was made using a high-speed diamond bur under air-water spray. Three restorative techniques were performed (n=7): Filtek Z250 placed in two increments (10-second exposure, shade:A2, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA), Filtek Z350 XT (40-second exposure, shade:A3D, 3M ESPE) and Tetric N Ceram Bulk Fill (10-second exposure, shade:IVA, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), both placed in a single layer. Bonding layer and resin composite were exposed to light from the same Polywave LCU (Bluephase 20i, Ivoclar Vivadent). The peak PT and the difference between peak PT and baseline (ΔT) values were subjected to two-way, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test (α=0.05).
Cavity preparation and etch & rinse procedures decreased the PT values (p<0.001). The 40-second exposure of Filtek Z350 caused the highest peak PT values (38.7±0.8°C) and the highest ΔT values (3.4±0.8°C), while Tetric N Ceram Bulk Fill showed the lowest values (-1.6±1.3°C; p=0.009).
None of the evaluated procedures resulted in a PT rise near to values that could offer any risk of thermal damage to the pulp.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34370040/

33342613,Effect of CAD-CAM tool deterioration on the trueness of ceramic restorations.,The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,2022,"Al Hamad KQ, Al Rashdan RB, Al Rashdan BA, Al Quran FA","Tools will gradually deteriorate with repetitive milling. However, tool lifetime can vary depending on the type of milling machine, the hardness of the ceramic material, and the size of the restoration. Studies evaluating the effect of tool deterioration on the trueness of milled restorations are lacking.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of tool deterioration on the trueness of milled restorations.
A patient requiring a ceramic crown was recruited. Repetitive milling of zirconia crowns (inCoris TZI; Dentsply Sirona) with tungsten carbide rotary instruments and glass-ceramic crowns (VITABLOCS mark II; Vita Zahnfabrik) with diamond rotary instruments was performed by using a 5-axis milling machine (inLab MC X5; Dentsply Sirona) until the machine software program indicated replacing the largest tool. The percentage of deterioration for the largest tool was recorded before each milling. The trueness for different crown areas was evaluated by using a 3-dimensional evaluation software program (Geomagic Control X; 3D systems), and the crowns were clinically evaluated. The crowns were grouped into 4 quadrants as per the deterioration percentage. The Pearson correlation (r) between the deterioration percentage and trueness and linear contrast analysis (partial eta squared [η]) among the groups were performed.
Glass-ceramic crown areas had low correlation except for mesial (high, r=0.63, high, η=0.37) and distal (medium, r=0.42, high, η= 0.34) areas, whereas zirconia crowns had low correlation for inner and internal areas and medium to high correlation for mesial (r= -0.31, η=0.33), distal (r= -0.53, η=0.36), occlusal (r= -0.32, η=0.164), external (r= 0.69, η=0.52), and marginal (r= -0.44, η=0.19) areas. Zirconia crowns had excellent marginal fit and occlusal contact and light to excellent proximal contact, whereas glass-ceramic crowns had excellent marginal fit, minor to major occlusal correction, and heavy proximal contact.
The effect of tool deterioration on trueness depended on material type and crown area. Only proximal areas were affected in the glass-ceramic crowns, whereas external, proximal, occlusal, and marginal areas were affected in the zirconia crowns. Trueness did not necessarily reflect the clinical quality of the crown, as both crown types were clinically satisfactory. Although zirconia crowns were overmilled in comparison with the reference design and glass-ceramic crowns, they had better clinical quality.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33342613/
33028796,Influence of zirconia surface treatments of a bilayer restorative assembly on the fatigue performance.,Journal of prosthodontic research,2021,"Machado PS, Pereira GKR, Zucuni CP, Guilardi LF, Valandro LF, Rippe MP","This study evaluated the influence of different surface treatments of zirconia used to enhance bonding with veneering porcelain, and thermocycling on the resistance to porcelain cracking and delamination during fatigue test.
Bilayer ceramic discs were made from zirconia blocks (IPS e.max Zircad MO, Ivoclar Vivadent - 0.7 mm thickness) and randomized into 8 groups (n= 15) according to two factors: 'zirconia surface treatment' (Control; Grinding - diamond bur; Air-abrasion - aluminum oxide particles; and Liner - application of a ceramic liner [IPS e.max Zirliner, Ivoclar Vivadent]); and 'thermocycling' (presence - 12,000 thermal cycles; 5-55ºC; or absence). The discs were veneered with porcelain (IPS e.max Ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent - 0.7 mm; totaling 1.4 mm thickness) according to ISO 6872:2015 for biaxial flexure strength testing. Fatigue tests (step-stress approach; 20 to 100 MPa; step of 10 MPa; 10,000 cycles per step; 10 Hz frequency) were run, followed by the data analysis (Kaplan-Meier and Mantel-Cox post-hoc tests). Analysis of roughness, topography, crystallographic phase arranges and fractography were also executed.
The surface treatment and thermocycling did not influence the porcelain crack nor delamination resistance. When only comparing the surface treatments for crack resistance outcome, the liner application depicted the worst fatigue performance in comparison to grinding and air-abrasion, while all groups were similar for delamination.
Neither the surface treatment of the zirconia nor the thermocycling influences the porcelain crack resistance or the resistance to delamination of the bilayer porcelain-veneered zirconia specimens.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33028796/

Hence, the current study is aimed at estimating the probability of survival of anterior crowns supported by different narrow implant systems. Three different narrow implant systems of internal conical connections were evaluated (Ø3.5 × 10 mm): (i) Active (Nobel Biocare), (ii) Epikut (S.I.N. Implant System), and (iii) BLX (Straumann). Abutments were torqued to the implants, and standardized maxillary incisor crowns were cemented. The assemblies were subjected to step-stress accelerated life testing (SSALT) in water through load application of 30 degrees off-axis lingually at the incisal edge of the crowns using a flat tungsten carbide indenter until fracture or suspension. The use level probability Weibull curves and reliability for completion of a mission of 100,000 cycles at 80 N and 120 N were calculated and plotted.

31760304,Development of artificial neural network model for prediction of post-streptococcus mutans in dental caries.,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,2020,"Javed S, Zakirulla M, Baig RU, Asif SM, Meer AB","Streptococcus mutans is the primary initiator and most common organism associated with dental caries. Prediction of post-Streptococcus mutans favours in the selection of appropriate caries excavation method which eventually results in meliorate caries-free cavity preparation for restoration. The objective of this study is to predict the post-Streptococcus mutans prior to dental caries excavation based on pre- Streptococcus mutans using iOS App developed on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
For the current research work, children with occlusal dentinal caries lesion were chosen, 45 primary molar teeth cases were studied. Caries excavation was done with carbide bur, polymer bur and spoon excavator. The colony forming units for pre and post-Streptococcus mutans were recorded, data emanating from clinical trials was employed to develop the ANN models. ANN models were trained, validated and tested with the registered clinical data using different ANN architectures.
Feedforward backpropagation ANN model with an architecture of 4-5-1, predicts post-Streptococcus mutans with an efficiency of 0.99033, mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error for testing cases were 0.2341 and 4.967 respectively.
Caries excavation methods and pre-Streptococcus mutans are feed as inputs, while post-Streptococcus mutans as targets to develop ANN model. Based on the developed ANN model, an ingenious iOS App was developed, the global clinician may utilize the App to meticulously predict post-Streptococcus mutans on iPhone based on pre-Streptococcus mutans, which in turn aids in decision making for the selection of caries excavation method. This study manifests the potential application of iOS App with built-in ANN model in efficiently predicting the post-Streptococcus mutans. Also, the study extends scope for applications of iOS App with built-in ANN models in clinical medicine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31760304/

Eighteen patients with four similar-sized occlusal lesions in molar teeth were included to the study. A total of 72 class I cavities were prepared either by Er,Cr:YSGG laser or conventional diamond bur. Cavities were restored with Filtek Silorane (3M-ESPE) (silorane-based) or Kalore (GC) (methacrylate-based) according to the manufacturers' instructions. All restorative procedures were performed by one operator, and the restorations were examined by two evaluators according to the FDI criteria at baseline and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. Patients' satisfaction about the preparation methods was also evaluated with a questionnaire. Pearson chi-square test was used for statistical analysis (p = 0.05).
The 60-month recall rate was 88.8% and the retention rates for experimental groups were 100%. After 60 months, no significant differences were detected among groups, regarding marginal adaptation, marginal staining, surface staining, color match, and translucency. None of the restorations exhibited postoperative sensitivity or recurrence of caries.
Different preparation techniques had no effect on the longevity of restorations. The two low-shrinkage composite systems tested were both clinically acceptable after 60 months.
Low-shrinkage composites showed similar clinical performance in class I cavities prepared with a laser or conventional bur after a 60-month observation period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31102045/
