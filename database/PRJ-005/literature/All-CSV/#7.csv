39046646,Investigating the impact of surface treatments on tensile bond strength between pediatric prefabricated zirconia crowns and primary maxillary incisors with various types of luting cement: an in vitro study.,European archives of paediatric dentistry : official journal of the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry,2024,"Chinadet W, Pengpue P, Chaijareenont P","This study aimed to evaluate the effects of two surface treatments on the tensile bond strength of prefabricated zirconia crowns (PZCs) using bioactive and resin cements.
Forty extracted human primary maxillary incisors were prepared and divided into four groups based on surface treatment and cement type: (1) sandblast with bioactive cement, (2) sandblast with resin cement, (3) 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10-MDP) with bioactive cement, and (4) 10-MDP with resin cement. After 24 h of cementation, specimens underwent 5000 thermocycling cycles between 5 °C and 55 °C. Tensile bond strengths were measured using a universal testing machine. The data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test, with significance set at p < 0.05.
The mean tensile bond strengths observed were 2.25 ± 1.27 MPa for sandblast with bioactive cement, 1.39 ± 0.95 MPa for sandblast with resin cement, 2.45 ± 1.15 MPa for 10-MDP with bioactive cement, and 1.68 ± 1.03 MPa for 10-MDP with resin cement. Significant improvements in bond strength were observed in the bioactive cement group treated with 10-MDP compared to those treated with sandblasting (p < 0.05). The 10-MDP treatment did not enhance bond strength for the resin cement compared to sandblasting.
Bioactive cement generally provides a higher tensile bond strength than resin cement. While 10-MDP treatment enhances bond strength when used with bioactive cement, it does not show a similar enhancement when used with resin cement compared to sandblasting, indicating its effectiveness is selective based on the type of cement used.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39046646/
38680076,"Effects of sterilization, conditioning, and thermal aging on the retention of zirconia hybrid abutments: A laboratory study.",Clinical implant dentistry and related research,2024,"Alghanaim N, Kern M, Yazigi C, Chaar MS","To investigate the effects of sterilization, conditioning method, and thermal aging on the retentive strength of two-piece zirconia abutments.
In total, 128 stock zirconia abutments were divided into four groups (n = 32) according to the conditioning parameters: (A) air-abrasion using 50 μm alumina particles/1.0 bar, (B) 50 μm/2.0 bar, (C) 100 μm/1.0 bar, and (D) 100 μm/2.0 bar. All abutments were bonded onto titanium bases using DTK adhesive resin and stored in water bath (37°C) for 72 h. Each group was subdivided into two subgroups (n = 16), group 1 was disinfected, whereas group 2 followed disinfection and autoclave sterilization. Half of the specimens of each subgroup (n&amp;#x02009;=&amp;#x02009;8) was directly subjected to the axial retention test (groups N), while the other half was first subjected to 150&amp;#x02009;days of thermocycling followed by retention test (groups T). Statistical analysis was performed with three-way ANOVA, additional statistical analysis was performed by using separate one-way ANOVAs followed by the Tukey's post-hoc test for post hoc pairwise comparisons among groups.
The highest median retention strength was recorded for group B2N (1390 N), whereas the lowest strength was recorded for group C1T (688 N). No significant interaction (p ≥ 0.05) was detected between the different variables; conditioning method, sterilization, and the thermal cycling regarding the effect on the resulting retention. However, the sterilization always showed a positive effect. Thermocycling presented an adversely significant effect only in the absence of sterilization (p < 0.05), with the exception of subgroups A. For the sterilized groups, thermocycling had no statistically significant effect on the retention.
Steam autoclaving increased the retention of hybrid zirconia abutments. DTK adhesive resin for two-piece zirconia abutments performed well after sterilization and thermocycling.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38680076/
37981045,Long-term clinical outcome of three-unit fixed-fixed posterior zirconia ceramic inlay-retained FDPs with a modified design.,Journal of dentistry,2024,"Chaar MS, Passia N, Becker M, Kern M","To assess the long-term clinical outcome of posterior inlay-retained fixed dental prostheses (IRFDPs) with a modified design made from zirconia ceramic.
In 30 patients thirty 3-unit IRFDPs were placed to replace 7 premolars (4 in the maxilla, 3 in the mandible), and 23 first molars (15 in the maxilla, 8 in the mandible). Preparations were accomplished in agreement with the general principles for ceramic inlay restorations and modified with a short retainer-wing bevel preparation within the enamel at the buccal and oral sides. The frameworks were milled from 3Y-TZP ceramic, and the pontics were veneered with feldspathic ceramic. All IRFDPs were bonded with a phosphate monomer containing luting resin after air-abrasion of the intaglio surfaces. The patients were recalled 6-12 months after placement, and then annually. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate the survival and complication rates of the IRFDPs.
The mean observation time was 10.6 ± 1.5 years. The 10-year cumulative survival rate was 89% with 4 failures, two of them were due to deep secondary caries with loss of retention, one due to repeated debonding with enamel fractures, and one due to generalized progressive periodontitis. The most common complication was chipping of the veneering ceramic (20.1%). Eighteen IRFDPs were free of any type of complication up to 15.4 years, which corresponds to a 10-year cumulative success rate of 70.4%.
The long-term clinical performance of modified IRFDPs made of veneered zirconia ceramics was favorable after 10 years, therefore, they represent a treatment alternative to replace posterior single missing teeth.
Zirconia-based IRFDPs fabricated in the modified design may represent a substance-preserving alternative to conventional posterior FDPs to replace posterior single missing teeth, particularly in cases where implants cannot be placed, and when the adjacent teeth already have small restorations or defects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37981045/
37816489,Effects of silane coupling treatment on the clinical performance of direct repaired resin-based composite (RBC) restorations with or without prior surface sandblasting: A randomized controlled trial.,Journal of dentistry,2023,"Albashaireh ZSM, Maghaireh GA, Alsaafeen HN","To evaluate the effects, of using silane coupling agent within the procedures of repairing old composite restorations with or without sandblasting their surfaces, on the clinical performance of repaired composite restorations.
The study involved repairing 130 Class I and II defective composite restorations. After recurrent caries removal, the repair process included etching with 37 % phosphoric acid, Adper Single Bond 2 application for bonding and Filtek Z250 composite for restoring all defects. The restoration surfaces were subjected to one of the following additional surface treatments within the repair process: Control: No additional treatment; the Silane-Adhesive treatment: A separate step involved the application of a silane coupling agent after acid etching; and the Sandblast-Silane-Adhesive treatment: included intra-oral sandblasting of old composite surfaces followed by silane application. Two calibrated examiners evaluated all repaired restorations according to a modified USPHS criteria after 6 months. Comparisons of the clinical performance between the treatment groups were made using Chi-square test, while responses to cold tests before and after repair treatment were made using Wilcoxon's Signed Rank's (α = 0.05).
Of 130 cases, only 116 cases turned up for evaluation. The primary reasons for composite repair were recurrent caries and anatomical deficiencies. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups for all clinical criteria (p > 0.05). The control group experienced one total and two partial retention losses.
The application of a silane coupling agent, with or without intra-oral sandblasting, demonstrated no improvement on the clinical performance of repaired posterior composites after 6-months.
Surface treatment of defective composite restorations using silane with intra-oral sandblasting within their repair process offered marginal improvement in their clinical performance over conventional etching technique, but insignificantly so. Repair reduced exaggerated cold test responses and eliminated POS within 6-months. Repair reduces cold sensitivity and promotes restoration longevity. This clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the registration number NCT06005571.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37816489/
33314768,The efficacy of polyether-ether-ketone wire as a retainer following orthodontic treatment.,Clinical and experimental dental research,2021,"Kadhum AS, Alhuwaizi AF","To investigate the efficacy of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) wire as a fixed orthodontic retainer, by comparing its performance to other retainer wires and optimizing its adhesion to composite bonding materials.
Retainer wires of 15 mm segments were used, PEEK wires were prepared in cylindrical form with 0.8 mm diameter, and had two surface treatments namely air-abrasion and conditioning with adhesive system. Three different metallic retainer wires were used for comparison and three tests were performed; two tests measured debonding force and associated wire deflection from acrylic blocks and bovine teeth and one test for pull-out force. To test debonding force, a vertically directed compressive force was applied to the retainer wires bonded to the acrylic blocks and bovine teeth, while for pull-out test; a vertically directed tensile force detached the retainer wire.
In both debonding tests, PEEK wires (regardless the surface treatment) had non-significant difference when compared to each other, or to the other metallic wires, except the dead-soft coaxial wire group. The dead-soft coaxial wire group had significant difference when compared to other groups regarding both the force magnitude and maximum deflection, the only exception was the debonding force of the flat braided retainer wires bonded to bovine teeth. In pull-out test PEEK wires conditioned with adhesive system and the air-abraded recorded the second and third highest readings respectively.
Within the limitations of this study, the 0.8 mm round PEEK wires have comparable performance-in terms of debonding and pull out forces-to conventional retainers when bonded with 4 mm composite bonding spots; using air-abrasion for 10 s at 3.5 MPa provided sufficient adhesion of the composite to the wire, and conditioning with adhesive system may provide no further clinical benefit.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33314768/
