39580722,Microcomputed tomography assessment of microleakage and void formation under ceramic adhesive precoated orthodontic brackets.,"American journal of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics : official publication of the American Association of Orthodontists, its constituent societies, and the American Board of Orthodontics",2025,"Adıgüzel A, Yıldırım E","This study aimed to evaluate microleakage, voids, and gaps in ceramic adhesive precoated (APC) brackets using microcomputed tomography and investigate their correlation with bond strength.
A total of 52 human premolars were included in this study. The teeth were randomly divided into 4 groups of 13 teeth each. The brackets used in this study were the Clarity Advanced APC Flash-free Ceramic Bracket (3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) and the Clarity Advanced Ceramic Bracket (3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif). The materials used for each group were as follows: (1) 37% phosphoric acid, Transbond XT primer (3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif), and APC Flash-free Ceramic Bracket; (2) Transbond Plus self-etching primer and APC Flash-free Ceramic Bracket; (3) 37% phosphoric acid, Transbond XT primer, Transbond XT light-cure adhesive, and Clarity Advanced Ceramic Bracket; and (4) Transbond Plus self-etching primer, Transbond XT light-cure adhesive, and Clarity Advanced Ceramic Bracket. The teeth were scanned using microcomputed tomography for microleakage, void, and gap analyses. The bond strength was measured and recorded in megapascals. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare parameters with a normal distribution. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare parameters that did not comply with the normal distribution. The relationships among variables were evaluated using Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients.
There were no statistically significant differences among the groups in terms of gap volume, void volume, and total void and gap volume values (P >0.05). No significant differences were observed in relation to bond strength (P >0.05). The mean bond strength was 20.42, 19.87, 19.28, and 19.47 for groups 1-4, respectively. The Spearman's correlation analysis results demonstrated that the bond strength was significantly affected by the gap volume and total void and gap volumes. The bond strength increased with reduced total volume of voids and gaps.
There was no difference between the APC Flash-free Ceramic Bracket and the Clarity Advance Ceramic Bracket regarding bond strength, void volume, gap volume, and total void and gap volume. The gap volume and total void and gap volumes significantly affected the bond strength. The bond strength increased with decreased total void and gap volumes. The bond strengths of the APC Flash-free Ceramic Brackets were comparable to those of the ceramic brackets bonded using the conventional method.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39580722/

Blocks of ZLS were sectioned to obtain a total of 90 specimens (1.5 mm thick), which were assigned to 9 different surface treatment protocols (n = 10). Either hydrofluoric acid (HF) surface conditioner or ammonium polyfluoride self-etching ceramic primer (Monobond Etch & Prime [MEP]) was used for surface treatment and then combined with different bonding strategies (Monobond N silane-based universal primer, Prosil silane coupling agent, Ambar Universal APS self-etching adhesive, and/or Signum Zirconia Bond methyl methacrylate-based bonding system [SZB]) and luting agents (Allcem or Multilink Automix dual-curing resin cement). Composite resin cylinders were bonded to ZLS with each of the cementation protocols, and the specimens were subjected to 6000 thermal cycles from 5°C to 55°C prior to the μSBS evaluation. The failure mode was analyzed with the aid of a stereoscopic loupe. Statistical analyses were performed with 1-way analysis of variance and Tukey HSD test (α = 0.05). The HF and MEP protocols resulted in significantly higher μSBS values (P < 0.001), while conditioning with SZB resulted in the lowest μSBS. Multilink Automix groups presented higher μSBS values than Allcem groups (P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the μSBS values of the MEP + Allcem groups based on whether or not an adhesive layer was applied. The failure mode was predominantly adhesive for all specimens. The results indicate that the ammonium polyfluoride-based material MEP may be used as a substitute for surface treatment with HF and silane, but the use of a zirconia primer alone is not advised for bonding to a ZLS ceramic material.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39451085/

Fully sintered high translucent zirconia specimens (n = 120) were assigned into 2 groups (n = 60 each): Control (No Pretreatment) and Methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate salt (MDP-Salt) pretreated. Each group was divided into 3 subgroups (n = 20) according to cementation protocol: 1) MDP + Silane primer and conventional resin cement, 2) MDP+ Bisphenyl dimethacrylate (BPDM) primer and conventional resin cement, and 3) MDP containing self-adhesive resin cement. Shear bond strength (SBS) was measured after 10,000 thermocycling. Contact angle was measured for tested groups. Surface topography was assessed using a 3D confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). Weibull analysis was performed for SBS and one-way ANOVA for contact angle and surface topography measurements (α = 0.05).
The use of MDP-Salt significantly improved the SBS (p < .05) for all tested subgroups. Self-adhesive cement showed an insignificant difference with MDP + Silane group for both groups (p > .05). MDP + BPDM showed a significantly lower characteristic strength compared to self-adhesive resin cement when both were pretreated with MDP-Salt. No difference between all tested groups in the surface topographic measurements while MDP-Salt showed the highest contact angle.
MDP-Salt pretreatment can improve bonding performance between zirconia and MDP containing products.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37993834/
37670286,Fracture resistance of monolithic translucent zirconia crown bonded with different self-adhesive resin cement: influence of MDP-containing zirconia primer after aging.,BMC oral health,2023,"Tyor S, Al-Zordk W, Sakrana AA","Successful ceramic restorations depend on the strong bonding with resin cement and even stress distribution. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of adding MDP-containing zirconia primer before self-adhesive resin cements with different functional acidic monomers on fracture resistance of monolithic zirconia crown.
Eighty defect-free human maxillary premolars were divided according to the cement type and application of MDP-containing zirconia primer into eight groups (n = 10): Calibra Universal (C), Calibra Universal combined with zirconia primer (CZ), RelyX U200 (R), RelyXU200 combined with zirconia primer (RZ), Panavia SA Cement Plus (P), Panavia SA Cement Plus combined with zirconia primer (PZ), Multilink Speed (M), and Multilink Speed combined with zirconia primer (MZ). After teeth preparation and fabrication of zirconia crowns, each crown was bonded to its corresponding tooth. All specimens were subjected to 10,000 thermocycles between 5 and 55°C, followed by cyclic load (50 N) for 240,000 cycles. Each specimen was subjected to a static axial load until fracture using universal testing machine and the fracture load was recorded. The fracture mode studied and recorded. The fracture load results were analyzed using two-way ANOVA test (α = 0.05).
A significant interaction (P = 0.038) of combining MDP-containing zirconia primer and cement type on fracture resistance of monolithic zirconia crown was detected. The mean fracture load values of zirconia crown were significantly influenced by the combined application of the MDP-containing zirconia primer with Calibra Universal (P = 0.01), RelyX U200 (P < 0.001), and Multilink Speed (P = 0.038), while there was no significant difference with Panavia SA Cement Plus (P = 0.660). There was significant difference (F = 20.69, P < 0.001) between the mean fracture loads of groups with self-adhesive cements (C, R, P, and M groups). The highest fracture load was recorded with RZ group (2446.90 ± 126.72 N) while the lowest fracture load was recorded with C group (1623.18 ± 149.86 N).
The self-adhesive resin cement with different acidic functional monomer affects the fracture resistance of monolithic zirconia crown. Application of MDP-containing primer could improve the fracture resistance of monolithic zirconia crown with most self-adhesive cements. The application of an MDP-containing primer had no impact on the fracture resistance of monolithic translucent zirconia crown bonded by MDP-containing self-adhesive resin cement.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37670286/
37017436,Comparison of three orthodontic bonding systems in white spot lesion development: a randomized clinical trial.,The Angle orthodontist,2023,"Horan OGA, Al-Khateeb SN","To compare the development of white spot lesions (WSLs) during fixed orthodontic therapy among a conventional three-step bonding system, a self-etching primer bonding system, and a one-step adhesive bonding system.
Seventy-five patients were randomly allocated into three groups (group 1, conventional bonding system, n = 25; group 2, self-etch primer, n = 25; group 3, primer mixed with adhesive composite, n = 25). Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) was used to assess WSL parameters. Images were captured and then analyzed before treatment and at 2 months and 4 months after bond up. Lesion area (pixels), mean fluorescence loss (ΔF), and the number of newly developed WSLs were compared within and among the three groups. The significance level was P ≤ .05.
The mean increase in lesion area was 31.3 ± 2.8 pixels, 38.4 ± 4.3 pixels, and 119.5 ± 5.3 pixels for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P ≤ .001). For ΔF, the loss was 3.3% ± 0.3%, 4.4% ± 0.2%, and 6.6% ± 0.2% for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These changes were significantly different (P ≤ .01 to P ≤ .001). The incidence of newly developed lesions was 9.5 WSLs in group 1, 10 WSLs in group 2, and 15.9 WSLs in group 3.
The lack of primer contributed to the development of a larger number of and more severe WSLs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37017436/

An unrestricted search of indexed databases was performed with the following eligibility criteria: (a) human fluorotic teeth (experimental-group); (b) human teeth without fluorosis (control-group); (c) studies using phosphoric acid (PA) etching without air abrasion (AA), PA etching combined with AA, and application of self-etching primer (SEP) alone as bonding interventions/techniques and (d) measuring SBS in megapascals (MPa). Data screening, selection and extraction were performed by two reviewers. The risk of bias (rob) was assessed using the JBI Critical appraisal tool for Quasi-Experimental Studies. Meta-analyses were performed using a random effects model. The quality of available evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Ten in vitro studies were included. Subgroup analyses were performed for each intervention type. The SBS was significantly lower in fluorotic teeth when PA was used without AA (mean difference = 3.26 MPa, confidence interval: [1.00, 5.52]); and there were no significant differences for the PA combined with AA and SEP interventions. All studies had a low rob. The overall level of evidence was at best low. The SBS is lower in teeth with EF when traditional PA is used. No significant differences were found in SBS between teeth with and without EF when PA is used with AA or when SEP is used alone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35960660/

Thirty extracted molars were prepared with flat occlusal surfaces, 20 degrees taper, and 3 mm axial wall height. A zirconia crown with an occlusal bar was fabricated for each tooth. All specimens were divided (n = 10) into; Group M: Multilink Speed/Monobond N, Group P: Panavia V5/Clearfil Ceramic Primer Plus, Group D: Duo-Link universal/Z-Prime Plus. The intaglio surfaces of crowns were air-abraded using 50 µm alumina at 2.5 bar for 10 s. Then each crown was cemented onto its corresponding tooth. All specimens were thermocycled for 10,000 cycles between 5 and 55 °C. Each crown was subjected to gradually increasing vertical load along the path of insertion through hooks engaging the occlusal bar using a universal testing machine until failure. The force at dislodgment was recorded and retention strength was calculated for each specimen. The failure modes were recorded for each specimen. The data were statistically analyzed using one way ANOVA test followed by Tukey HSD test (α = .05).
Group D showed lowest strength (1.42 ± 0.23 MPa) and differed significantly (P < .001) from Group M (2.71 ± 0.45 MPa) and Group P (2.47 ± 0.41 MPa). There was no significant difference (P = .34) between Group M and Group P. The failure modes for Groups M and Group P were mainly cohesive, while Group D showed adhesive failure.
The retention strength of zirconia crowns was improved with Multilink Speed and Panavia V5 cement systems, while the use of the Duo-Link Universal cement system only showed half of those retention strength values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35590310/

One hundred twenty-five freshly extracted human premolars were randomly and blindly divided into five groups according to the enamel surface preparation, as follows (n=25): group 1(control): Etching with 37% phosphoric acid for 15seconds+Bonding; group 2 (control): TBP™ without NaOCl, group 3: 60seconds NaOCl+TBP™, group 4: 30seconds NaOCl+TBP™, group 5: 15seconds NaOCl+TBP™. The same composite resin was used (Transbond XT™) to bond the orthodontic metal brackets. After the immersion of the teeth in distilled water at 37°C for 24hours the shear bond strength was measured using the universal testing machine and the adhesive remnant index score (ARI) was evaluated under an optical microscope (25×).
The mean SBS values (inMPa) of the groups were respectively: group 1: 13.03±5.36; group 2: 12.28±3.06; group 3: 12.38±4.55; group 4: 12.98±5.76; and group 5: 11.73±5.67. Enamel deproteinization increased the SBS for groups 3 and 4, but no statistically significant difference was found between the five groups (P=0.883). Group 1 showed the highest ARI scores, with 52% of the teeth retaining all the adhesive (score 3). However, for all the other groups, scores 0 and 1 were predominant, with less than half of the adhesive or no adhesive at all remaining on the teeth.

All specimens were randomly divided into four groups according to the combinations of the methods (Direct or Indirect) and the materials (DC: Clearfil DC Core, Kuraray Noritake Dental or PV: Panavia V5, Kuraray Noritake Dental). Micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) and push-out tests were performed. Scanning electron microscope observations of the interface were also performed, and microcomputed tomography and optical coherence tomography were applied to evaluate the sealing ability.Results The Indirect group had significantly higher μTBSs than the Direct group in the DC group (P = 0.0076). The PV group had significantly higher bond strengths than the DC group in both the Direct and Indirect groups (P < 0.001). The Direct/PV group demonstrated significantly higher push-out bond strength than the Direct/DC group (P < 0.001). In the Direct/PV group, the formation of resin tags was observed even on the apical side of the canal. Microleakage was more clearly observed in the DC group than in the PV group.Conclusions PV has a higher bonding ability to root canal dentin than DC. When using DC, the indirect technique exhibited a higher bonding ability than the direct technique.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34053974/
31859658,Comparison of 2 self-adhesive resin cements with or without a self-etching primer.,General dentistry,2020,"Meharry MR, Schwartz J, Montalvo A, Mueller D, Mitchell JC","Self-adhesive resin cements that eliminate the primer step have been introduced to simplify the bonding protocol for indirect restorations. The aim of the present study was to compare the shear bond strengths (SBSs) of 2 self-adhesive resin cements used with or without a self-etching primer. The hypothesis was that adding a separate primer component to the self-adhesive systems would increase the SBS at the tooth-adhesive interface. One hundred twenty extracted human molars were hemisectioned and embedded in epoxy. Specimens were polished to expose enamel or dentin surfaces and randomly assigned to 12 test groups (n = 20). The tested variables were (1) the type of bonded tissue (enamel or dentin); (2) the cement used; (3) whether the cement was applied with or without a primer; (4) and whether the primer was air dried or photopolymerized. Bonding jigs were used to apply the self-adhesive resin cement to the tooth surfaces. A 2-minute self-cure was followed by 20 seconds of light curing. Specimens were stored in water for 24 hours and then subjected to SBS testing in a universal testing machine. Fractured specimens were examined under a microscope to determine the modes of failure. Mean SBS values were compared using a paired Student t test (with post hoc Tukey test) and an analysis of variance (α = 0.05). Compared to the control groups, the air-dried primer groups showed SBSs that were 4-6 times greater for the specimens bonded to dentin and 2-3 times greater for specimens bonded to enamel. The photopolymerized primer groups followed the same trend. The photopolymerized groups showed higher percentages of cohesive tooth failure than did air-dried primer groups. Placement of a self-etching primer prior to a self-adhesive resin cement significantly increased the SBS to tooth structure of the ""all-in-1"" resin cements that were tested. Photopolymerizing the primer did not significantly increase the bond strength.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31859658/
