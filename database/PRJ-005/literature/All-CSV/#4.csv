41248549,Crucial features from CWT analysis of single lead EEG signal to detect sleep arousal.,Biomedical physics & engineering express,2025,"Ali MH, Uddin MB","Sleep arousal, characterized by emergence of light sleep or partial wakefulness, often indicates underlying physical disorders, and its detection is crucial for effective patient treatment. While the detection of arousals using multiple signals can be effective, the dependencies on multiple electrodes impose burden on patients. To resolve this issue, some effective features estimated from single-lead electroencephalography (EEG) signals were proposed to detect sleep arousal. Normalized and filtered EEG signals were segmented into 7-s frames, and scalograms were estimated using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Scalograms and local properties such as frequency, bandwidth, band energy, band energy ratio, maxima, and regularity were derived from the coefficients of CWT. Final classification features were generated using statistical analyses. The most effective features, estimated by correlation coefficients and",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41248549/

International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics : [proceedings],2025,"Soto-Florido M, Garcia-Cifuentes E, Irragorri AM, Mondragon IF, Mendez D, Colorado JD, Alvarado-Rojas C","Stroke rehabilitation is essential for restoring upper limb function, impaired in nearly 85% of stroke survivors. Accurate classification of movement intention and execution can enhance rehabilitation through improved patient monitoring and robotic assistance. This study explores integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals to classify five hand movements commonly used in rehabilitation therapy: four finger pinches and full hand closure. Biological signals were acquired from 22 healthy participants using a synchronized setup of EEG and EMG systems. Signal processing methods were applied to extract frequency and connectivity features from EEG and muscle activity metrics from EMG. These features were used to train machine learning models, including Ensemble Bagged Trees, neural networks, and SVMs, for classifying movement intention and execution. Results demonstrated that the Ensemble Bagged Trees model achieved the highest accuracy classified 5 classes, particularly when employing EEG power spectral density features, with 84.7% and 67.4% accuracy for movement execution and intention, respectively. Correlation analysis identified distinct motor-related brain connectivity patterns, offering insights into neuromotor processes. These findings support the integration of EEG-EMG analysis with machine learning to enhance stroke rehabilitation, improving patient monitoring and robotic-assisted therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40644142/

EEG and MRI play essential roles in diagnosis, while AI aids in evaluating big datasets for more accurate seizure identification. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly integrated into diagnostic processes to enhance seizure detection and classification. Wearable technology improves patient self-monitoring and helps clinical research. Furthermore, gene treatments offer promise by treating the fundamental causes of seizure activity, while stem cell therapies give neuroprotective and regenerative advantages. Dietary interventions, including ketogenic diets, are being examined for their ability to modify neurochemical pathways implicated in epilepsy.
Recent technological and therapeutic developments provide major benefits in epilepsy assessment and treatment, with AI and wearable devices enhancing seizure detection and patient monitoring. Nonetheless, additional study is essential to ensure greater clinical application and efficacy. Future perspectives include the potential of optogenetics and advanced signal processing techniques to revolutionize treatment paradigms, emphasizing the importance of personalized medicine in epilepsy care.

40158909,Artificial intelligence applied to electroencephalography in epilepsy.,Revue neurologique,2025,"Alvarado-Rojas C, Huberfeld G","Artificial intelligence (AI) is progressively transforming all fields of medicine, promising substantial changes in clinical practice. In the context of epilepsy, electroencephalography (EEG), a technique used for over a century, has historically been resistant to automated analysis due to the complexity of the signals and the challenges posed by artifact management. While the human eye excels at recognizing patterns, algorithms have demonstrated superior capabilities in detecting and characterizing specific features, such as long-term dynamics and synchrony. Furthermore, the advent of wearable EEG devices has led to an exponential increase in data volume, surpassing the limits of visual interpretation. AI algorithms are now being developed to address these limitations, offering enhanced efficiency in both identifying subtle signal features and managing massive datasets. This review explores the fundamental principles of AI and its transformative potential in the field of EEG. It discusses the implications and the current limitations, including improvements limited to aggregation of already known knowledge, for epilepsy diagnosis, medical and surgical treatment, and innovative approaches to patient monitoring, including seizure forecasting, highlighting how AI is poised to redefine the management of epilepsy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40158909/

This response signal manifests as a unique waveform referred to as the visually evoked potential (VEP), which can be extracted from the electroencephalogram (EEG) activity of a human being. We propose a trainable VEP representation to disentangle the underlying explanatory factors of the data. To enhance the learning process with domain knowledge, we present an innovative parameterization of classical Hermite functions that effectively captures VEP pattern variations arising from patient-specific factors, disorders, and measurement setup influences. Then, we introduce a differentiable variable projection (VP) layer to fuse Hermite basis function expansions (BFEs) of VEP signals with machine learning (ML) approaches. We prove the existence of an optimal set of parameters in the least-squares sense, assess the representation power of such layers, and calculate their analytical derivatives, which allows us to utilize backpropagation for training. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework in VEP-based color classification.

Timely diagnosis and treatment can prevent cardiovascular issues. An Electrocardiograms (ECG) serves as a diagnostic tool for identifying heart difficulties. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) often gets identified through ECGs. Deep learning (DL) garners attention in healthcare due to its potential in swiftly diagnosing ECG anomalies, crucial for patient monitoring. Conversely, automatic CVD detection from ECGs poses a challenging task, wherein rule-based diagnostic models usually achieve top-notch performance. These models encounter complications in supervision vast volumes of diverse data, demanding widespread analysis and medical capability to ensure precise CVD diagnosis.
This study aims to enhance cardiovascular disease diagnosis by combining symptom-based detection and ECG analysis.
To enhance these experiments, we built a novel automated prediction method based on a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) model. The fundamental objective of our method is to develop the accuracy of ECG diagnosis. Our strategy employs chaos theory and destruction analysis to combine optimum deep learning features with a well-organized set of ECG properties. In addition, we use the constant-Q non-stationary Gabor transform (CQNGT) to convert one-dimensional ECG data into a two-dimensional picture. A pre-trained FFNN processes this image. To identify significant features from the FFNN output that correspond with the ECG data, we employ pairwise feature proximity.
According to experimental findings, the suggested system, FFNN-CQNGT, surpasses other state-of-the-art systems in terms of precision of 94.89%, computational efficiency of 2.114 ms, accuracy of 95.55%, specificity of 93.77%, and sensitivity of 93.99% and MSE 40.32%.

The CONOX (Fresenius Kabi) calculates two indices, the qCON (hypnotic level) and the qNOX (nociception). The CONOX also calculates indices for electromyographic (EMG) activity and EEG burst suppression (BSR). Because all EEG parameters seem to influence each other, our goal was a detailed description of parameter relationships.
We used qCON, qNOX, EMG, and BSR information from 14 patients receiving propofol anesthesia. We described index relationships with linear models, heat maps, and box plot representations. We also evaluated associations between qCON/qNOX and propofol/remifentanil effect site concentrations (ceP/ceR).
qNOX and qCON (qCON = 0.79*qNOX + 5.8; p < 0.001; R
We could describe relationships between qCON, qNOX, EMG, BSR, ceP, and ceR, which may help the anaesthesiologist better interpret the information provided. One major finding is the dependence of qCON > 80 on EMG activity. This may limit the possibility of detecting wakefulness in the absence of EMG. Further, qNOX seems generally higher than qCON, but high opioid doses may lead to higher qCON than qNOX indices.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39266928/

Electronic records of referrals, patient monitoring notes, and EEG reports were accessed retrospectively. Each referral was assessed to determine whether the patient had an ID. For each study where patients were discharged prematurely, the outcomes of their EEG report were assessed and compared between the ID and non-ID groups. Exploratory analysis was performed assessing the effects of age, the percentage of the requested monitoring undertaken, and outcome rates as a function of monitoring duration.
There were significantly more patients in the ID group with early disconnection than the non-ID group (Chi squared test, p = 0.000). There was no significant difference in the rates of clinical outcomes between the ID and non-ID groups amongst patients who disconnected early.
Although rates of early disconnection are higher in those with ID, study outcomes are largely similar between patients with and without ID in this retrospective analysis of an ambulatory EEG service.

37756246,The Influence of Electromyographic on Electroencephalogram-Based Monitoring: Putting the Forearm on the Forehead.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2024,"Lichtenfeld F, Kratzer S, Hinzmann D, García PS, Schneider G, Kreuzer M","Monitoring the electroencephalogram (EEG) during general anesthesia can help to safely navigate the patient through the procedure by avoiding too deep or light anesthetic levels. In daily clinical practice, the EEG is recorded from the forehead and available neuromonitoring systems translate the EEG information into an index inversely correlating with the anesthetic level. Electrode placement on the forehead can lead to an influence of electromyographic (EMG) activity on the recorded signal in patients without neuromuscular blockade (NMB). A separation of EEG and EMG in the clinical setting is difficult because both signals share an overlapping frequency range. Previous research showed that indices decreased when EMG was absent in awake volunteers with NMB. Here, we investigated to what extent the indices changed, when EEG recorded during surgery with NMB agents was superimposed with EMG.
We recorded EMG from the flexor muscles of the forearm of 18 healthy volunteers with a CONOX monitor during different activity settings, that is, during contraction using a grip strengthener and during active diversion (relaxed arm). Both the forehead and forearm muscles are striated muscles. The recorded EMG was normalized by z -scoring and added to the EEG in different amplification steps. The EEG was recorded during anesthesia with NMB. We replayed these combined EEG and EMG signals to different neuromonitoring systems, that is, bispectral index (BIS), CONOX with qCON and qNOX, and entropy module with state entropy (SE) and response entropy (RE). We used the Friedman test and a Tukey-Kramer post hoc correction for statistical analysis.
The indices of all neuromonitoring systems significantly increased when the EEG was superimposed with the contraction EMG and with high EMG amplitudes, the monitors returned invalid values, representative of artifact contamination. When replaying the EEG being superimposed with ""relaxed"" EMG, the qCON and BIS showed significant increases, but not SE and RE. For SE and RE, we observed an increased number of invalid values.
With our approach, we could show that EMG activity during contraction and resting state can influence the neuromonitoring systems. This knowledge may help to improve EEG-based patient monitoring in the future and help the anesthesiologist to use the neuromonitoring systems with more knowledge regarding their function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37756246/

Although studies imply that sex hormones could affect sleep, research on exogenous sex hormones on sleep architecture is still inconclusive. This study examined sleep architecture changes in transgender individuals after 3 months of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT).
We assessed sleep architecture in 73 transgender individuals: 38 transmasculine participants who started using testosterone and 35 transfeminine participants who started using estrogens and antiandrogens. Sleep architecture was measured before GAHT and after 3 months of GAHT for 7 nights using an ambulatory single-electrode sleep EEG device. Changes in sleep architecture were analyzed using linear mixed models, and non-normally distributed outcomes were log-transformed and reported as percentages.
In transmasculine participants, SWS decreased by 7 minutes (95% CI: -12; -3) and 1.7% (95% CI: -3%; -0.5%), REM sleep latency decreased by 39% (95% CI: -52%; -22%) and REM sleep duration increased by 17 minutes (95% CI: 7; 26) after 3 months of GAHT. In transfeminine participants, sleep architecture showed no significant changes after 3 months of GAHT.
Sleep architecture changes after 3 months of masculinizing GAHT in line with sleep in cisgender males, while it shows no changes after feminizing GAHT. The sex-specific nature of these changes raises new questions about sex hormones and sleep.

Clinically, electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is a well-established method to guide GA. There are no established methods available for monitoring EEG in mice (Mus musculus) during surgery. In this study, a minimally invasive rodent intraoperative EEG monitoring system was implemented using subdermal needle electrodes and a modified EEG-based commercial patient monitor. EEG recordings were acquired at three different isoflurane concentrations revealing that surgical concentrations of isoflurane anesthesia predominantly contained burst suppression patterns in mice. EEG suppression ratios and suppression durations showed strong positive correlations with the isoflurane concentrations. The electroencephalographic indices provided by the monitor did not support online monitoring of the anesthetic status.

By elucidating the effects of low-dose nitrous oxide on the power spectra of multi-channel EEG recordings, we quantified the degree to which these effects generalise across participants. In this single-blind, cross-over study, 32-channel EEG was recorded from 12 healthy participants exposed to 0, 20, 30 and 40% end-tidal nitrous oxide. Features of the delta-, theta-, alpha- and beta-band power were used within a 12-fold, participant-wise cross-validation framework to train and test two SVMs: (1) binary SVM classifying EEG during 0 or 40% exposure (chance = 50%); (2) multi-class SVM classifying EEG during 0, 20, 30 or 40% exposure (chance = 25%). Both the binary (accuracy 92%) and the multi-class (accuracy 52%) SVMs classified EEG recordings at rates significantly better than chance (p < 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively). To determine the relative importance of frequency band features for classification accuracy, we systematically removed features before re-training and re-testing the SVMs. This showed the relative importance of decreased delta power and the frontal region. SVM classification identified that the most important effects of nitrous oxide were found in the delta band in the frontal electrodes that was consistent between participants. Furthermore, support-vector classification of nitrous oxide dosage is a promising method that might be used to improve patient monitoring during nitrous oxide anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37440117/

However, reported experimental protocols for EEG-fMRI recordings fail to address details about conducting such procedures on epilepsy patients. In addition, these protocols are limited solely to research settings. To fill the gap between patient monitoring in an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) and conducting research with an epilepsy patient, we introduce a unique EEG-fMRI recording protocol of epilepsy during the interictal period. The use of an MR conditional electrode set, which can also be used in the EMU for a simultaneous scalp EEG and video recording, allows an easy transition of EEG recordings from the EMU to the scanning room for concurrent EEG-fMRI recordings. Details on the recording procedures using this specific MR conditional electrode set are provided. In addition, the study explains step-by-step EEG processing procedures to remove the imaging artifacts, which can then be used for clinical review. This experimental protocol promotes an amendment to the conventional EEG-fMRI recording for enhanced applicability in both clinical (i.e., EMU) and research settings.

To reduce hospital-based monitoring, interventions are being developed to enable high-quality EEG data to be collected at home. This scoping review aims to summarise the current state of remote EEG monitoring research, potential benefits and limitations of the interventions, and inclusion of PwID in this research.
The review was structured using the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews and the PICOS framework. Studies that evaluated a remote EEG monitoring intervention in adults with epilepsy were retrieved from the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. A descriptive analysis provided an overview of the study and intervention characteristics, key results, strengths, and limitations.
34,127 studies were retrieved and 23 were included. Five types of remote EEG monitoring were identified. Common benefits included producing useful results of comparable quality to inpatient monitoring and patient experience. A common limitation was the challenge of capturing all seizures with a small number of localised electrodes. No randomised controlled trials were included, few studies reported sensitivity and specificity, and only three considered PwID.

Long-term in-patient monitoring is obtrusive, and expensive as compared to outpatient monitoring. No studies have so far investigated if long-term outpatient EEG monitoring is able to identify epileptiform discharges in AD. Our aim is to investigate if epileptiform discharges as measured with ear-EEG are more common in patients with AD compared to healthy elderly controls (HC).
In this longitudinal observational study, 24 patients with mild to moderate AD and 15 age-matched HC were included in the analysis. Patients with AD underwent up to three ear-EEG recordings, each lasting up to two days, within 6 months.
The first recording was defined as the baseline recording. At baseline, epileptiform discharges were detected in 75.0% of patients with AD and in 46.7% of HC (p-value = 0.073). The spike frequency (spikes or sharp waves/24 h) was significantly higher in patients with AD as compared to HC with a risk ratio of 2.90 (CI: 1.77-5.01, p < 0.001). Most patients with AD (91.7%) showed epileptiform discharges when combining all ear-EEG recordings.
Long-term ear-EEG monitoring detects epileptiform discharges in most patients with AD with a three-fold increased spike frequency compared to HC, which most likely originates from the temporal lobes. Since most patients showed epileptiform discharges with multiple recordings, elevated spike frequency should be considered a marker of hyperexcitability in AD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37196736/

We aimed to survey Canadian EMUs to describe the landscape of safety practices and compare these to the recommendations from the new guidelines.
A 34-item survey was created by compiling questions on EMU structure, patient monitoring, equipment, personnel, standardized protocol use, and use of injury prevention tools. The questionnaire was distributed online to 24 Canadian hospital centers performing video-EEG monitoring (VEM) in EMUs. Responses were tabulated and descriptively summarized.
In total, 26 EMUs responded (100% response rate), 50% of which were adult EMUs. EMUs were on average active for 23.4 years and had on average 3.6 beds. About 81% of respondents reported having a dedicated area for VEM, and 65% reported having designated EMU beds. Although a video monitoring station was available in 96% of EMUs, only 48% of EMUs provided continuous observation of patients (video and/or physical). A total of 65% of EMUs employed continuous heart monitoring. The technologist-to-patient ratio was 1:1-2 in 52% of EMUs during the day. No technologist supervision was most often reported in the evening and at night. Nurse-to-EMU-patient ratio was mostly 1:1-4 independent of the time of day. Consent forms were required before admission in 27% of EMUs.

In this paper, we propose an ambulatory EEG device, OptiEEG, that has low setup complexity, for the remote EEG monitoring of epilepsy patients. OptiEEG's signal quality was compared with a gold standard clinical device, Natus. The experiment between OptiEEG and Natus included three different tests: eye open/close (EOC); hyperventilation (HV); and photic stimulation (PS). Statistical and wavelet analysis of retrieved data were presented when evaluating the performance of OptiEEG. The SNR and PSNR of OptiEEG were slightly lower than Natus, but within an acceptable bound. The standard deviations of MSE for both devices were almost in a similar range for the three tests. The frequency band energy analysis is consistent between the two devices. A rhythmic slowdown of theta and delta was observed in HV, whereas photic driving was observed during PS in both devices.

Many people suffer from sleep disorders that are characterized by abnormal sleep patterns. Automated assessment of such disorders using biomedical signals has been an active subject of research. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a popular diagnostic used in this regard. We consider a widely-used publicly available database and process the signals using the Fourier decomposition method (FDM) to obtain narrowband signal components. Statistical features extracted from these components are passed on to machine learning classifiers to identify different stages of sleep. A novel feature measuring the non-stationarity of the signal is also used to capture salient information. It is shown that classification results can be improved by using multi-channel EEG instead of single-channel EEG data. Simultaneous utilization of multiple modalities, such as Electromyogram (EMG), Electrooculogram (EOG) along with EEG data leads to further enhancement in the obtained results.

It is important to appreciate the raw electroencephalographic changes under anaesthesia and those associated with ageing, in order to interpret depth of anaesthesia indices correctly. Cerebral oximetry is useful not only for the detection of cerebral desaturation but also to identify those patients who are particularly vulnerable to injury, for better risk stratification. An algorithm-based approach may be most effective in managing the episodes of cerebral desaturation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35001382/

Neuromonitoring devices can be invasive or non-invasive and are typically used on patients with acute brain injury or at high risk for brain injury. The goal of this study was to characterize neuromonitoring infrastructure and practices in North American pediatric intensive care units (PICUs).
An electronic, web-based survey was distributed to 70 North American institutions participating in the Pediatric Neurocritical Care Research Group. Questions related to the clinical use of neuromonitoring devices, integrative multimodality neuromonitoring capabilities, and neuromonitoring infrastructure were included. Survey results were presented using descriptive statistics.
The survey was completed by faculty at 74% (52 of 70) of institutions. All 52 institutions measure intracranial pressure and have electroencephalography capability, whereas 87% (45 of 52) use near-infrared spectroscopy and 40% (21/52) use transcranial Doppler. Individual patient monitoring decisions were driven by institutional protocols and collaboration between critical care, neurology, and neurosurgery attendings. Reported device utilization varied by brain injury etiology. Only 15% (eight of 52) of institutions utilized a multimodality neuromonitoring platform to integrate and synchronize data from multiple devices. A database of neuromonitoring patients was maintained at 35% (18 of 52) of institutions. Funding for neuromonitoring programs was variable with contributions from hospitals (19%, 10 of 52), private donations (12%, six of 52), and research funds (12%, six of 52), although 73% (40 of 52) have no dedicated funds.
Neuromonitoring indications, devices, and infrastructure vary by institution in North American pediatric critical care units. Noninvasive modalities were utilized more liberally, although not uniformly, than invasive monitoring. Further studies are needed to standardize the acquisition, interpretation, and reporting of clinical neuromonitoring data, and to determine whether neuromonitoring systems impact neurological outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34864306/
34543237,The Strength of Alpha Oscillations in the Electroencephalogram Differently Affects Algorithms Used for Anesthesia Monitoring.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2021,"Weyer C, Prötzl E, Kinateder T, Nowak F, Husemann C, Hautmann H, Kratzer S, Schneider G, Kreuzer M","Intraoperative patient monitoring using the electroencephalogram (EEG) can help to adequately adjust the anesthetic level. Therefore, the processed EEG (pEEG) provides the anesthesiologist with the estimated anesthesia level. The commonly used approaches track the changes from a fast- and a low-amplitude EEG during wakefulness to a slow- and a high-amplitude EEG under general anesthesia. However, besides these changes, another EEG feature, a strong oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz), develops in the frontal EEG. Strong alpha-band activity during general anesthesia seems to reflect an appropriate anesthetic level for certain anesthetics, but the way the common pEEG approaches react to changes in the alpha-band activity is not well explained. Hence, we investigated the impact of an artificial alpha-band modulation on pEEG approaches used in anesthesia research.
We performed our analyses based on 30 seconds of simulated sedation (n = 25) EEG, simulated anesthesia (n = 25) EEG, and EEG episodes from 20 patients extracted from a steady state that showed a clearly identifiable alpha peak in the density spectral array (DSA) and a state entropy (GE Healthcare) around 50, indicative of adequate anesthesia. From these traces, we isolated the alpha activity by band-pass filtering (8-12 Hz) and added this alpha activity to or subtracted it from the signals in a stepwise manner. For each of the original and modified signals, the following pEEG values were calculated: (1) spectral edge frequency (SEF95), (2) beta ratio, (3) spectral entropy (SpEntr), (4) approximate entropy (ApEn), and (5) permutation entropy (PeEn).
The pEEG approaches showed different reactions to the alpha-band modification that depended on the data set and the amplification step. The beta ratio and PeEn decreased with increasing alpha activity for all data sets, indicating a deepening of anesthesia. The other pEEG approaches behaved nonuniformly. SEF95, SpEntr, and ApEn decreased with increasing alpha for the simulated anesthesia data (arousal) but decreased for simulated sedation. For the patient EEG, ApEn indicated an arousal, and SEF95 and SpEntr showed a nonuniform change.
Changes in the alpha-band activity lead to different reactions for different pEEG approaches. Hence, the presence of strong oscillatory alpha activity that reflects an adequate level of anesthesia may be interpreted differently, by an either increasing (arousal) or decreasing (deepening) pEEG value. This could complicate anesthesia navigation and prevent the adjustment to an adequate, alpha-dominant anesthesia level, when titrating by the pEEG values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34543237/

Such transmission is performed via Wireless Medical Sensor Network (WMSN) while diagnosing patients remotely through Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT). The sensitive data transmitted through WMSN from IoMT over an insecure channel is vulnerable to several threats and needs proper attention to be secured from adversaries. In contrast to addressing the security of all associated entities involving patient monitoring in the healthcare system or ensuring the integrity, authorization, and nonrepudiation of information over the communication line, no one can guarantee its security without a robust authentication protocol. Therefore, we have proposed a lightweight and robust authentication scheme for the network-enabled healthcare devices (IoMT) that mitigate all the identified weaknesses posed in the recent literature. The proposed protocol's security has been analyzed formally using BAN logic and ProVerif2.02 and informally using pragmatic illustration. Simultaneously, at the end of the paper, the performance analysis result shows a delicate balance of security with performance that is often missing in the current protocols.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34336174/

We present a proof-of-concept for a seizure detection system that is sensitive, automated, patient-specific, and tunable to maximise sensitivity while minimizing human annotation times. The system uses custom data preparation methods, deep learning analytics and electroencephalography (EEG) data.
Scalp EEG data of 365 patients containing 171,745 s ictal and 2,185,864 s interictal samples obtained from clinical monitoring systems were analysed as part of a crowdsourced artificial intelligence (AI) challenge. Participants were tasked to develop an ictal/interictal classifier with high sensitivity and low false alarm rates. We built a challenge platform that prevented participants from downloading or directly accessing the data while allowing crowdsourced model development.
The automatic detection system achieved tunable sensitivities between 75.00% and 91.60% allowing a reduction in the amount of raw EEG data to be reviewed by a human annotator by factors between 142x, and 22x respectively. The algorithm enables instantaneous reviewer-managed optimization of the balance between sensitivity and the amount of raw EEG data to be reviewed.
This study demonstrates the utility of deep learning for patient-specific seizure detection in EEG data. Furthermore, deep learning in combination with a human reviewer can provide the basis for an assistive data labelling system lowering the time of manual review while maintaining human expert annotation performance.

Annual International Conference,2020,"Kamali G, Smith RJ, Hays M, Coogan C, Crone NE, Sarma SV, Kang JY","Surgical resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) could potentially lead to seizure-freedom in medically refractory epilepsy patients. However, localizing the SOZ can be a time consuming and tedious process involving visual inspection of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings captured during passive patient monitoring. Single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) is currently performed on patients undergoing invasive EEG monitoring for the main purposes of mapping functional brain networks such as language and motor networks. We hypothesize that evoked responses from SPES can also be used to localize the SOZ as they may express the natural frequencies and connectivity of the iEEG network. To test our hypothesis, we construct patient specific single-input multi-output transfer function models from the evoked responses recorded from five epilepsy patients that underwent SPES evaluation and iEEG monitoring. Our preliminary results suggest that the stimulation electrodes that produced the highest gain transfer functions, as measured by the ${\mathcal{H}_\infty }$ norm, correspond to those electrodes clinically defined in the SOZ in successfully treated patients.Clinical Relevance- This study creates an innovative tool that allows clinicians to identify the seizure onset zone in medically refractory epilepsy patients using quantitative metrics thereby increasing surgical success outcomes, mitigating patient risks, and decreasing costs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33018520/

Some monitoring systems like the SEDLine Root allow export of the EEG to be used for retrospective analysis. We show that changes made to the SEDLine display during recording affected the recorded EEG. These changes can strongly impact retrospective analysis of EEG signals. Real-time changes of the feed speed in the SEDLine Root device display modifies the sampling rate of the exported EEG. We used a patient as well as a simulated EEG recording to highlight the effects of the display settings on the extracted EEG. Therefore, we changed EEG feed and amplitude resolution on the display in a systematic manner. To visualize the effects of these changes, we present raw EEG segments and the density spectral array of the recording. Changing the display's amplitude resolution affects the amplitudes. If the amplitude resolution is too fine, the exported EEG contains clipped amplitudes. If the resolution is too coarse, the EEG resolution becomes too low leading to a low-quality signal making frequency analysis impossible. The proportion of clipped or zero-line data caused by the amplitude setting was > 60% in our sedated patient. Changing the display settings results in undocumented changes in EEG amplitude, sampling rate, and signal quality. The occult nature of these changes could make the analysis of data sets difficult if not invalid.

Time series estimation to obtain the future samples of EEG signal has vital role for detecting seizure attack. In this paper, a novel density-based real-time seizure prediction algorithm based on a trained offline seizure detection algorithm is proposed.
In the offline seizure detection procedure, after signal preprocessing, histogram-based statistical features are extracted from signal probability distribution. By defining a deterministic polynomial model on the normalized histogram, a novel syntactic feature that is named Interpolated Histogram Feature (IHF) is proposed. Moreover, with this feature, Seizure Distribution Model (SDM) as a descriptor of the seizure and non-seizure signals is presented. By using a novel hybrid optimization algorithm based on Bayesian classifier and Hunting Search (HuS) algorithm, the optimal features are selected. To detect the seizure attacks in the online mode, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is trained with the optimal features in the offline procedure. For online prediction, the enhanced Recursive Least Square (RLS) filter is applied to estimate sample-by-sample of the EEG signal. Also, a density-based signal tracking scenario is introduced to update and tune the parameters of RLS filtering algorithm.
Our prediction algorithm is evaluated on 104 hours of EEG signals recorded from 23 pediatric patients. Our online signal prediction algorithm provides the accuracy rate of 86.56% and precision rate of 86.53% simultaneously using the trained MLP classifier from the offline mode. The recall rate of seizure prediction is 97.27% and the false prediction rate of 0.00215 per hour is achieved as well. Ultimately, the future samples of EEG signal are estimated, and the time of seizure signal prediction is also converged to 6.64 seconds.
In our proposed real-time algorithm, by implementing a density-based signal tracking scenario, the future samples of signal with suitable time is predicted and the seizure is detected based on the optimal features from the IHF and histogram-based statistical features with acceptable performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27282233/

Patients aged ⩾18years who underwent VEM from May 2009 to June 2014 were studied retrospectively. Demographic, clinical and VEM data (including total monitoring length, type and time to first event, total number of ES/PNES) were collected.

26772751,Robust detection of heartbeats using association models from blood pressure and EEG signals.,Biomedical engineering online,2016,"Jeon T, Yu J, Pedrycz W, Jeon M, Lee B, Lee B","The heartbeat is fundamental cardiac activity which is straightforwardly detected with a variety of measurement techniques for analyzing physiological signals. Unfortunately, unexpected noise or contaminated signals can distort or cut out electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in practice, misleading the heartbeat detectors to report a false heart rate or suspend itself for a considerable length of time in the worst case. To deal with the problem of unreliable heartbeat detection, PhysioNet/CinC suggests a challenge in 2014 for developing robust heart beat detectors using multimodal signals.
This article proposes a multimodal data association method that supplements ECG as a primary input signal with blood pressure (BP) and electroencephalogram (EEG) as complementary input signals when input signals are unreliable. If the current signal quality index (SQI) qualifies ECG as a reliable input signal, our method applies QRS detection to ECG and reports heartbeats. Otherwise, the current SQI selects the best supplementary input signal between BP and EEG after evaluating the current SQI of BP. When BP is chosen as a supplementary input signal, our association model between ECG and BP enables us to compute their regular intervals, detect characteristics BP signals, and estimate the locations of the heartbeat. When both ECG and BP are not qualified, our fusion method resorts to the association model between ECG and EEG that allows us to apply an adaptive filter to ECG and EEG, extract the QRS candidates, and report heartbeats.
The proposed method achieved an overall score of 86.26 % for the test data when the input signals are unreliable. Our method outperformed the traditional method, which achieved 79.28 % using QRS detector and BP detector from PhysioNet. Our multimodal signal processing method outperforms the conventional unimodal method of taking ECG signals alone for both training and test data sets.
To detect the heartbeat robustly, we have proposed a novel multimodal data association method of supplementing ECG with a variety of physiological signals and accounting for the patient-specific lag between different pulsatile signals and ECG. Multimodal signal detectors and data-fusion approaches such as those proposed in this article can reduce false alarms and improve patient monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26772751/

Brain Sentinel (San Antonio, Texas, USA) developed a seizure-detection algorithm evaluating surface electromyography (sEMG) signals during GTCS. This study aims to validate the seizure-detection algorithm using inpatient video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring.
sEMG was recorded unilaterally from the biceps/triceps muscles in 33 patients (17white/16 male) with a mean age of 40 (range 14-64) years who were admitted for video-EEG monitoring. Maximum voluntary biceps contraction was measured in each patient to set up the baseline physiologic muscle threshold. The raw EMG signal was recorded using conventional amplifiers, sampling at 1,024 Hz and filtered with a 60 Hz noise detection algorithm before it was processed with three band-pass filters at pass frequencies of 3-40, 130-240, and 300-400 Hz. A seizure-detection algorithm utilizing Hotelling's T-squared power analysis of compound muscle action potentials was used to identify GTCS and correlated with video-EEG recordings.
In 1,399 h of continuous recording, there were 196 epileptic seizures (21 GTCS, 96 myoclonic, 28 tonic, 12 absence, and 42 focal seizures with or without loss of awareness) and 4 nonepileptic spells. During retrospective, offline evaluation of sEMG from the biceps alone, the algorithm detected 20 GTCS (95%) in 11 patients, averaging within 20 s of electroclinical onset of generalized tonic activity, as identified by video-EEG monitoring. Only one false-positive detection occurred during the postictal period following a GTCS, but false alarms were not triggered by other seizure types or spells.
Brain Sentinel's seizure detection algorithm demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity for identifying GTCS recorded in an epilepsy monitoring unit.

DWT is applied to obtain a reconstructed OA signal as a reference while ANC, based on recursive least squares, is used to remove the OA from the original EEG data. The newly produced sensors were tested and deployed within the OPTIMI framework for chronic stress detection. EEG nonlinear dynamics features and frontal asymmetry of theta, alpha, and beta bands have been selected as biological indicators for chronic stress, showing relative greater right anterior EEG data activity in stressful individuals. Evaluation results demonstrate that our EEG sensor and data processing algorithms have successfully addressed the requirements and challenges of a portable system for patient monitoring, as envisioned by the EU OPTIMI project.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25935041/
24887599,Integration of EEG lead placement templates into traditional technologist-based staffing models reduces costs in continuous video-EEG monitoring service.,Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,2014,"Kolls BJ, Lai AH, Srinivas AA, Reid RR","The purpose of this study was to determine the relative cost reductions within different staffing models for continuous video-electroencephalography (cvEEG) service by introducing a template system for 10/20 lead application.
We compared six staffing models using decision tree modeling based on historical service line utilization data from the cvEEG service at our center. Templates were integrated into technologist-based service lines in six different ways. The six models studied were templates for all studies, templates for intensive care unit (ICU) studies, templates for on-call studies, templates for studies of ≤ 24-hour duration, technologists for on-call studies, and technologists for all studies.
Cost was linearly related to the study volume for all models with the ""templates for all"" model incurring the lowest cost. The ""technologists for all"" model carried the greatest cost. Direct cost comparison shows that any introduction of templates results in cost savings, with the templates being used for patients located in the ICU being the second most cost efficient and the most practical of the combined models to implement. Cost difference between the highest and lowest cost models under the base case produced an annual estimated savings of $267,574. Implementation of the ICU template model at our institution under base case conditions would result in a $205,230 savings over our current ""technologist for all"" model.
Any implementation of templates into a technologist-based cvEEG service line results in cost savings, with the most significant annual savings coming from using the templates for all studies, but the most practical implementation approach with the second highest cost reduction being the template used in the ICU. The lowered costs determined in this work suggest that a template-based cvEEG service could be supported at smaller centers with significantly reduced costs and could allow for broader use of cvEEG patient monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24887599/
24883378,Detection of burst suppression patterns in EEG using recurrence rate.,TheScientificWorldJournal,2014,"Liang Z, Wang Y, Ren Y, Li D, Voss L, Sleigh J, Li X","Burst suppression is a unique electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern commonly seen in cases of severely reduced brain activity such as overdose of general anesthesia. It is important to detect burst suppression reliably during the administration of anesthetic or sedative agents, especially for cerebral-protective treatments in various neurosurgical diseases. This study investigates recurrent plot (RP) analysis for the detection of the burst suppression pattern (BSP) in EEG. The RP analysis is applied to EEG data containing BSPs collected from 14 patients. Firstly we obtain the best selection of parameters for RP analysis. Then, the recurrence rate (RR), determinism (DET), and entropy (ENTR) are calculated. Then RR was selected as the best BSP index one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparison tests. Finally, the performance of RR analysis is compared with spectral analysis, bispectral analysis, approximate entropy, and the nonlinear energy operator (NLEO). ANOVA and multiple comparison tests showed that the RR could detect BSP and that it was superior to other measures with the highest sensitivity of suppression detection (96.49%, P = 0.03). Tracking BSP patterns is essential for clinical monitoring in critically ill and anesthetized patients. The purposed RR may provide an effective burst suppression detector for developing new patient monitoring systems.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24883378/

The model is based on discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) and adaptive noise cancellation (ANC). Using simulated and measured data, the accuracy of the model is compared with the accuracy of other existing methods based on stationary wavelet transforms and our previous work based on wavelet packet transform and independent component analysis. A particularly novel feature of the new model is the use of DWTs to construct an OA reference signal, using the three lowest frequency wavelet coefficients of the EEGs. The results show that the new model demonstrates an improved performance with respect to the recovery of true EEG signals and also has a better tracking performance. Because the new model requires only single channel sources, it is well suited for use in portable environments where constraints with respect to acceptable wearable sensor attachments usually dictate single channel devices. The model is also applied and evaluated against data recorded within the EUFP 7 Project--Online Predictive Tools for Intervention in Mental Illness (OPTIMI). The results show that the proposed model is effective in removing OAs and meets the requirements of portable systems used for patient monitoring as typified by the OPTIMI project.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24592462/
24469356,Energy-efficient data reduction techniques for wireless seizure detection systems.,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2014,"Chiang J, Ward RK","The emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has motivated a paradigm shift in patient monitoring and disease control. Epilepsy management is one of the areas that could especially benefit from the use of WSN. By using miniaturized wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors, it is possible to perform ambulatory EEG recording and real-time seizure detection outside clinical settings. One major consideration in using such a wireless EEG-based system is the stringent battery energy constraint at the sensor side. Different solutions to reduce the power consumption at this side are therefore highly desired. The conventional approach incurs a high power consumption, as it transmits the entire EEG signals wirelessly to an external data server (where seizure detection is carried out). This paper examines the use of data reduction techniques for reducing the amount of data that has to be transmitted and, thereby, reducing the required power consumption at the sensor side. Two data reduction approaches are examined: compressive sensing-based EEG compression and low-complexity feature extraction. Their performance is evaluated in terms of seizure detection effectiveness and power consumption. Experimental results show that by performing low-complexity feature extraction at the sensor side and transmitting only the features that are pertinent to seizure detection to the server, a considerable overall saving in power is achieved. The battery life of the system is increased by 14 times, while the same seizure detection rate as the conventional approach (95%) is maintained.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24469356/

Six adult and two child neurologists, divided into four pairs, critically appraised 128 published reports and provided graded recommendations answering 15 key questions: length of the seizure-free period after treatment initiation, difference in seizure-free periods in children and adults, electroencephalography (EEG) pattern at the time of discontinuation, etiology of epilepsy, seizure type(s), patient's age and sex, family history of epilepsy, history of febrile seizures, epilepsy syndrome, seizure frequency before entering remission, duration of active epilepsy, tapering period, number and type of AEDs taken at time of discontinuation, combination of risk factors for recurrence, and length of patient monitoring after treatment discontinuation. Based on the available data, the following recommendations can be outlined: (1) antiepileptic treatment might be discontinued after a minimum period of 2 years of seizure freedom; shorter seizure-free periods are associated to a higher risk of relapse; (2) in children, AED discontinuation could be considered after less than two seizure-free years because of a marginally higher risk of relapse for early withdrawal; (3) factors, such as abnormal EEG (including epileptiform abnormalities) at the time of treatment discontinuation, a documented etiology of seizures (including mental retardation, perinatal insults, and abnormal neurologic examination), partial seizures, or an older age at disease onset, enhance the risk of relapse; however, patients should not be encouraged to withhold treatment unless a combination of two or more of these factors is present; (4) female sex, family history of epilepsy, history of febrile seizures, disease length/severity, and number and type of drugs taken should not influence the decision to stop treatment; (5) epilepsy syndrome should be always included in the decision process; (6) slow (at least 6 months) AED discontinuation should be encouraged; in any case the duration of the tapering period should be tailored to the patient's needs and preference; and (7) patient discontinuing treatment should be followed for no <2 years. As a general habit, the decision to stop treatment should be discussed and shared with each patient, taking into account social and personal complications of a seizure relapse and the medical complications of chronic AED treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24099051/
23887187,Local cortical dynamics of burst suppression in the anaesthetized brain.,Brain : a journal of neurology,2013,"Lewis LD, Ching S, Weiner VS, Peterfreund RA, Eskandar EN, Cash SS, Brown EN, Purdon PL","Burst suppression is an electroencephalogram pattern that consists of a quasi-periodic alternation between isoelectric 'suppressions' lasting seconds or minutes, and high-voltage 'bursts'. It is characteristic of a profoundly inactivated brain, occurring in conditions including hypothermia, deep general anaesthesia, infant encephalopathy and coma. It is also used in neurology as an electrophysiological endpoint in pharmacologically induced coma for brain protection after traumatic injury and during status epilepticus. Classically, burst suppression has been regarded as a 'global' state with synchronous activity throughout cortex. This assumption has influenced the clinical use of burst suppression as a way to broadly reduce neural activity. However, the extent of spatial homogeneity has not been fully explored due to the challenges in recording from multiple cortical sites simultaneously. The neurophysiological dynamics of large-scale cortical circuits during burst suppression are therefore not well understood. To address this question, we recorded intracranial electrocorticograms from patients who entered burst suppression while receiving propofol general anaesthesia. The electrodes were broadly distributed across cortex, enabling us to examine both the dynamics of burst suppression within local cortical regions and larger-scale network interactions. We found that in contrast to previous characterizations, bursts could be substantially asynchronous across the cortex. Furthermore, the state of burst suppression itself could occur in a limited cortical region while other areas exhibited ongoing continuous activity. In addition, we found a complex temporal structure within bursts, which recapitulated the spectral dynamics of the state preceding burst suppression, and evolved throughout the course of a single burst. Our observations imply that local cortical dynamics are not homogeneous, even during significant brain inactivation. Instead, cortical and, implicitly, subcortical circuits express seemingly different sensitivities to high doses of anaesthetics that suggest a hierarchy governing how the brain enters burst suppression, and emphasize the role of local dynamics in what has previously been regarded as a global state. These findings suggest a conceptual shift in how neurologists could assess the brain function of patients undergoing burst suppression. First, analysing spatial variation in burst suppression could provide insight into the circuit dysfunction underlying a given pathology, and could improve monitoring of medically-induced coma. Second, analysing the temporal dynamics within a burst could help assess the underlying brain state. This approach could be explored as a prognostic tool for recovery from coma, and for guiding treatment of status epilepticus. Overall, these results suggest new research directions and methods that could improve patient monitoring in clinical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23887187/

The goal of this study was to apply the new transcranial magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (tcMRgFUS) technology to perform noninvasive central lateral thalamotomies (CLTs) as a treatment for chronic neuropathic pain.
In 12 patients suffering from chronic therapy-resistant neuropathic pain, tcMRgFUS CLT was proposed. In 11 patients, precisely localized thermal ablations of 3-4 mm in diameter were produced in the posterior part of the central lateral thalamic nucleus at peak temperatures between 51 ° C and 64 ° C with the aid of real-time patient monitoring and MR imaging and MR thermometry guidance. The treated neuropathic pain syndromes had peripheral (5 patients) or central (6 patients) origins and covered all body parts (face, arm, leg, trunk, and hemibody).
Patients experienced mean pain relief of 49% at the 3-month follow-up (9 patients) and 57% at the 1-year follow-up (8 patients). Mean improvement according to the visual analog scale amounted to 42% at 3 months and 41% at 1 year. Six patients experienced immediate and persisting somatosensory improvements. Somatosensory and vestibular clinical manifestations were always observed during sonication time because of ultrasound-based neuronal activation and/or initial therapeutic effects. Quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) showed a significant reduction in EEG spectral overactivities. Thermal ablation sites showed sharply delineated ellipsoidal thermolesions surrounded by short-lived vasogenic edema. Lesion reconstructions (18 lesions in 9 patients) demonstrated targeting precision within a millimeter for all 3 coordinates. There was 1 complication, a bleed in the target with ischemia in the motor thalamus, which led to the introduction of 2 safety measures, that is, the detection of a potential cavitation by a cavitation detector and the maintenance of sonication temperatures below 60 ° C.
The authors assert that tcMRgFUS represents a noninvasive, precise, and radiation-free neurosurgical technique for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The procedure avoids mechanical brain tissue shift and eliminates the risk of infection. The possibility of applying sonication thermal spots free from trajectory restrictions should allow one to optimize target coverage. The real-time continuous MR imaging and MR thermometry monitoring of targeting accuracy and thermal effects are major factors in optimizing precision, safety, and efficacy in an outpatient context.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22208894/

Existing databases have typically been collected from patients in intensive care units. However, the physical state of intensive care patients is dissimilar to those undergoing surgery, more frequent and marked changes to cardiovascular and respiratory variables are seen in operating room patients, and additional and highly relevant information to anesthesia (e.g., end-tidal agent monitoring, etc.) is omitted from these intensive care databases. We collected a set of high-quality, high-resolution, multiple-parameter monitoring data suitable for anesthesia monitoring research.
Vital signs data were recorded from patients undergoing anesthesia at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Software was developed to capture, time synchronize, and interpolate vital signs data from Philips IntelliVue MP70 and MP30 patient monitors and Datex-Ohmeda Aestiva/5 anesthesia machines into 10 millisecond resolution samples. The recorded data were saved in a variety of accessible file formats.
Monitoring data were recorded from 32 cases (25 general anesthetics, 3 spinal anesthetics, 4 sedations) ranging in duration from 13 minutes to 5 hours (median 105 min). Most cases included data from the electrocardiograph, pulse oximeter, capnograph, noninvasive arterial blood pressure monitor, airway flow, and pressure monitor and, in a few cases, the Y-piece spirometer, electroencephalogram monitor, and arterial blood pressure monitor. Recorded data were processed and saved into 4 file formats: (1) comma-separated values text files with full numerical and waveform data, (2) numerical parameters recorded in comma-separated values files at 1-second intervals, (3) graphical plots of all waveform data in a range of resolutions as Portable Network Graphics image files, and (4) graphical overview plots of numerical data for entire cases as Portable Network Graphics and Scalable Vector Graphics files. The complete dataset is freely available online via doi:102.100.100/6914 and has been listed in the Australian National Data Service Collections Registry.
The present dataset provides clinical anesthesia monitoring data from entire surgical cases where patients underwent anesthesia, includes a wide range of vital signs variables that are commonly monitored during surgery, and is published in accessible, user-friendly file formats. The text and image file formats let researchers without engineering or computer science backgrounds easily access the data using standard spreadsheet and image browsing software.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) combined with EEG (fNIRS-EEG) is another imaging technique based on the measurement of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin with complementary clinical potential in epilepsy, for continuous patient monitoring, language lateralization, and focus localization. In this work fMRI-EEG and fNIRS-EEG are used to quantify nonlinear hemodynamic responses in three cases of human refractory focal epilepsy, by using the Volterra kernel expansion up to second order. Prior to analyzing real data, extensive simulations are carried out to show that nonlinearities are estimable. The Volterra methodology is then applied to multimodal data recorded from 3 epileptic patients selected for their frequent spiking activity. Care is taken to account for variability of hemodynamic responses due to other causes than Volterra nonlinearities. Statistically significant nonlinearities are observed for all patients and all modalities. Good concordance between fNIRS and fMRI is found for both the amplitude of the Volterra responses, and, with limitations, in the localization of the epileptic focus and regions of inverted responses (negative BOLD signals). In one patient, Volterra nonlinearities allowed epileptic focus identification with fMRI, while analyses without nonlinearities failed to see it. In simulations when nonlinearities were included, analysis without Volterra nonlinearities performed poorly. These two observations suggest routinely checking for nonlinearities in functional imaging of patients presenting with frequent spikes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22138633/

The rapid and accurate extraction of ABRs in clinical practice has numerous benefits, including reductions in clinical test times and potential long-term patient monitoring applications. One method of achieving rapid extraction is through the application of wavelet filtering which, according to earlier research, has shown potential in denoising signals with low signal-to-noise ratios. The research documented in this paper evaluates the application of three such wavelet approaches on a common set of ABR data collected from eight participants. We introduced the use of the latency-intensity curve of ABR wave V for performance evaluation of tracking temporal variations. The application of these methods to the ABR required establishing threshold functions and time windows as an integral part of the research. Results revealed that the cyclic-shift-tree-denoising performed superior compared to other tested approaches.

Usually a recorded VEP is severely contaminated by background ongoing activities of the spontaneous EEG signal in the human brain. Many approaches have been adopted to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the recorded signal. However, nonlinear dynamic methods are rarely investigated in view of their complexity, and the fact that the nonlinear characteristics of the signal are hard to determine in general. An adaptive noise cancellation method with NNFIS was carefully designed to estimate the VEP signal. NNFIS, based on Takagi and Sugeno's fuzzy model, has the advantage of being linear-in-parameter; thus the conventional adaptive methods can be efficiently utilized to estimate its parameters. Another advantage of NNFIS lies in that it can track the dynamic behavior of VEP in a real-time fashion because the VEP variation tracking is important for critical patient monitoring in the clinical situation.

Surface recordings of the brain's electrical activity reveal distinct patterns that indicate injury severity, depth of unconsciousness, and patient survival. The data produced with traditional qualitative studies, however, does not allow resolution and quantification of the wave frequency spectrum present in the brain. As a result, conventional EEG typically has only been used for gross and qualitative analyses and is not practical for use in long-term patient monitoring or as a sophisticated prognostic tool. One area of investigation that is working to address the limitations of conventional EEG has been the development and implementation of Fourier Transform (FT) EEG which resolves and quantifies frequency bands present in the brain. When FT analysis is applied to EEG, it provides concurrent and continuous monitoring, resolution, and quantification of all frequencies emitted. This review discusses the history and significance of conventional EEG and provides a review of how FT-EEG, commonly referred to as Quantitative EEG (QEEG), is being used in the clinical setting.

A follow-up sample of 25 patients confirmed reduced or event freedom in 21, 2 unchanged and 2 unknown. Five of the six patients had had their diagnosis confirmed following video EEG. In conclusion, CO-LTM provides clinically useful information.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9131447/

In this paper, a new technique is described in which EEG, BAEP, and SEP are recorded and evaluated simultaneously and continuously. This allows a better survey of different neuronal structures and systems in the brain and brainstem. First results from intraoperative and intensive care patient monitoring are reported.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3680495/
2415334,Automation of the seizure investigation unit at the University of British Columbia Health Sciences Centre Hospital.,Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology,1985,"Panych LP, Wada JA, Beddoes MP","At the University of British Columbia Health Sciences Centre Hospital we have constructed an automated Seizure Investigation Unit for long term monitoring of epileptic patients. A central component of this system is a new device, developed at the University of British Columbia, which prevents video and EEG records of seizures recorded on video tape from being over-recorded. Computer technology is relied upon to a considerable degree in our unit. Computers are seen, in this phase of development of the SIU, as a means of making patient monitoring less dependent on supervision. They can help to redirect human energy towards complex analysis rather than time consuming and simple monitoring tasks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2415334/
467015,A computer system for neurosurgical patient monitoring.,Computer programs in biomedicine,1979,Ackmann JJ,"The variables monitored in intensive care units are generally late indicators of neurologic deterioration. A system based on a LINC-8 computer was therefore developed for on-line monitoring of evoked potentials, electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial and transthoracic impedances as well as conventional parameters. Somatosensory evoked potentials are recorded at either 30 min or 1 h intervals. One minute epochs of EEG are analyzed every 10 min using a peak-detection algorithm. Impedances and conventional parameters are also monitored at 10 min intervals. In a study of 50 patients, the technical feasibility of this type of monitoring with a small laboratory computer has been demonstrated. In some instances, evoked potentials and EEG show changes prior to detectable neurologic changes. The study suggests that this type of monitoring can provide a valuable adjunct for evaluation of physiologic function in neurosurgical intensive care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/467015/

Relative simplicity, long battery life and a DC-response capability are the important features of these systems. The four physiological channels used are; electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, peripheral pulse, and arterial blood pressure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1028410/
1057681,Electroencephalographic and other neurophysiological abnormalities in uremia.,Kidney international. Supplement,1975,Teschan PE,"1) Neurophysiological abnormalities in patients with renal failure are being investigated because a) it is the nervous system which preeminently produces the phenomena of clinical uremia that dialysis affects and b) objective quantitative measures of such functions are generally lacking and are needed to provide objective evidence for adequacy of dialysis and other treatment measures in uremic patients. Accordingly, the attempt is warranted to measure in objective terms what renal failure, alternatively maintenance dialysis, does to the patient's nervous system in the comprehensive terms and the several modalities by which the nervous system serves the patient. 2) It is clear from the foregoing presentation that electroencephalographic phenomena including some aspects of the spontaneous EEG and certain event-related potentials can be readily reduced to quantitative terms. Some of these are abnormal in the presence of renal failure, are improved by dialysis treatment, may vary with the frequency of dialysis treatment and are often normalized by renal transplantation. Apparently similar EEG changes may be induced by other intercurrent influences occasionally operating in patients with renal failure. These can usually be readily detected but appear at this time to limit the potential usefulness of the EEG in those instances. However, especially using successive determinations in individual patients, the quantitative measure of slow-wave-associated EEG power is a reasonable candidate-measure of adequacy of dialysis. Other measures should be explored. 3) Quantitative measures of EEG phenomena appear to be superior in speed and objectivity to conventional, descriptive reporting of electroencephalograms, especially for the repetitive comparisons which are necessary for clinical patient monitoring. 4) The data system so far employed to transform EEG phenomena into clinically useful data (Fig. 1) will be greatly simplified as soon as the most informative, sensitive and specific measures are selected from among those being explored. Dedicated micro-processing equipment, for example, can then be expected to replace the much more expensive, multipurpose computer system which is necessary for the initial investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1057681/
