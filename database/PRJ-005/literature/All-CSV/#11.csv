All cavities were restored with FiltekTM Supreme composite resin (3M ESPE). The restorations were evaluated by two trained and calibrated evaluators using FDI and adapted USPHS criteria at baseline (12.02±5.68 days) and after 26 (± 2.36) months. The obtained data were subjected to statistical analysis between the groups using the Friedman and Wilcoxon test for intra-group analysis and the McNemar test for comparisons between FDI and USPHS criteria (α=0.05).
No statistically significant differences were observed between the ER, SEE, and SE groups after 26 months, except for marginal discoloration between the ER and SE groups (p≤0.05).
Class I and II resin composite restorations performed with Scotchbond Universal adhesive using ER, SEE, and SE modes showed acceptable clinical performance over a 26-month evaluation period.

A total of 22 patients (14 female and 8 male, aged ≥18 years) requiring restorative treatment provided 152 teeth with Class I or Class II carious lesions or defective restorations. Restorations were randomly assigned to six groups, including two control groups (Class I and II using the total-etch technique) and four test groups (Class I and II using either the self-etch technique or selective enamel etching). All restorations were performed using Beautibond Xtreme adhesive combined with Beautifill LS composite resin. Clinical performance was assessed at baseline, six months, and one year using modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria, including anatomic form, marginal adaptation, marginal discoloration, color match, surface texture, secondary caries, postoperative sensitivity, and retention. Randomization was performed with a computer-generated sequence, and two calibrated, blinded examiners (Kappa = 0.84) conducted all evaluations.
No significant changes were observed in anatomic form, color match, surface texture, secondary caries, postoperative sensitivity, or retention over time in any group (p>0.05). However, restorations performed using the self-etch technique showed significant deterioration in marginal adaptation and marginal discoloration from baseline to six months and one year (p<0.05). Significant differences were also observed when comparing these restorations to the total-etch and selective enamel etching groups (p<0.05).
The Beautibond Xtreme adhesive system demonstrated better clinical performance when applied with total-etch or selective enamel etching techniques compared to the self-etch mode for both Class I and Class II restorations after one year of follow-up.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41092140/

This study evaluates Er: YAG laser-assisted acid etching as a potential optimization protocol.
Twenty healthy teeth and ninety fluorotic teeth (Thylstrup-Fejerskov Index = 4) were divided into a control group (healthy enamel + acid etching) and a fluorotic group (acid etching 30/60/90 seconds vs. Er: YAG laser + acid etching). The enamel surface was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, and the shear bond strength (SBS) of each group (n = 10/group) was tested.
Attachments exhibited higher SBS than brackets (P < 0.01). Laser-acid etching enhanced SBS compared to acid etching alone (P < 0.01). Laser-treated surfaces exhibited predominantly mixed fracture and resin cohesion fractures, in contrast to adhesive interface fractures and mixed fractures in the acid-only groups.
Er: YAG laser (100mJ/30 Hz) with 60 seconds acid etching achieves excellent bonding for fluorotic enamel attachments, restoring adhesion to healthy enamel levels while preventing over-etching damage.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical effectiveness of a self-etching adhesive in combination with a dentin desensitizer (Gluma desensitizer), to a self-etching adhesive only, in preventing post-composite sensitivity immediately and over 30 days following a single topical application.
This clinical trial included 112 patients (206 teeth), who were randomized to receive self-etching adhesive in combination with Gluma desensitizer or a self-etching adhesive only. The included teeth were tested for tactile, air blast and cold stimuli, following which patients were asked to rate their sensitivity on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). The subjects were then assessed for post-composite sensitivity immediately after, as well as 1 week and 1 month following the treatment. Descriptive statistics were compared using t-test and Chi-square test. Intergroup comparisons of change in NRS scores to various stimuli were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.
The baseline comparison of NRS scores to air, water and tactile stimuli did not reveal any statistically significant differences. The change in NRS scores post air blast, 1 week and 1 month, after the treatment for sensitivity, was observed to be significantly higher in the Gluma group compared to self-etching adhesive (P = 0.001).

40255479,The effect of surface treatments on the bond strength of polyetheretherketone posts: a systematic review protocol.,F1000Research,2024,"Boukhris H, Ben Hadj Khalifa A, Hajjami H, Boudegga Ben Youssef S","Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is widely used in the biomedical field due to its outstanding biological and mechanical properties. Originally employed as a temporary abutment in implantology, recent research has expanded its indications for more definitive applications, such as frameworks and dental post and core. However, PEEK's inert nature and low surface energy pose challenges for adhesion, necessitating surface modifications. Various physical and chemical modification techniques, including acid etching (e.g., 98% sulfuric acid), sandblasting with alumina oxide (Al₂O₃), plasma treatment, laser irradiation, silanization, and air abrasion with silica-coated particles, have been proposed to enhance PEEK's bonding performance. Despite numerous clinical investigations, standardized protocols for surface treatment remain lacking. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of surface treatments on the bonding performance of PEEK posts.
A detailed search of the literature will be conducted across several databases including PubMed, Scopus and clinical trial registries. Additional databases such as Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Web of Science and EBSCO will also be included. The search strategy will target controlled randomized studies and non-randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of surface treatments on PEEK post adhesion strength. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) will be used to assess bias in non-randomized studies, while the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB II) tool will be employed for evaluating randomized controlled trials. Data extraction will focus on study design, treatment methods, outcomes and results.This systematic review protocol will adhere to the guidelines for systematic reviews outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).
The discussion will explore the implications of findings on clinical practice, highlighting the importance of enhancing PEEK's bioactivity and surface energy to improve bonding efficacy in dental procedures. Moreover, it will suggest areas for future research to advance dental materials science, aiming to optimize the utilization of PEEK in dental applications.

40156530,Effect of Selective Dentine Pre-Treatment with Butane Tetracarboxylic Acid on Composite-Dentine Bond.,Indian journal of dental research : official publication of Indian Society for Dental Research,2024,"Sharma N, Susila A, Veronica AK, Fiona RJ, Sai S, Anguswamy S","Composites are prone to time-dependent bond degradation. Many measures have been taken to stabilize the bond.
This in vitro study aims to evaluate the effect of pretreatment with 1,2,3,4-Butane Tetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) on the micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) of composite resin to dentine and to compare it with the pretreatment using 2% chlorhexidine (CHX).
Permanent molars (40) extracted for periodontal reasons were selected. Dentine surfaces were exposed using a diamond bur, preconditioned with BTCA for the test group (SIGMA-ALDRICH) and with CHX for the control group, followed by the application of self-etch adhesive (GC G-Premio bond) and composite restoration (GC Solare X). Each group was subdivided to be tested as: Group 1A: after 24 hours with BTCA; Group 1B: after 1 month with BTCA; Group 2A: after 24 hours with CHX; Group 2B: after 1 month with CHX. The µTBS was tested using a universal testing machine. The mode of failure was determined using a stereomicroscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM).
BTCA pretreatment was able to preserve the bond slightly better than the control group, though not statistically significant either at 24 hours (P = 0.492) or 1 month (P = 0.181). There was no significant reduction in the µTBS between immediate testing and 1-month storage for both groups (P = 0.213 for acid; P = 0.914 for CHX). The mode of failure was predominantly cohesive for both groups, with fewer adhesive failures.
BTCA pre-conditioning is capable of preserving the dentin-composite bond as efficiently as CHX.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40156530/

[et al.],2025,Mainjot AKJ,"To introduce no-prep zirconia cantilever resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses (Z-RBFDPs) as a noninvasive and simple approach to replacing individual anterior and posterior teeth.
Sixteen no-prep Z-RBFDPs were placed in 11 patients with a single missing tooth (15 lateral incisors, 1 canine, and 1 premolar); nine exhibited bruxism, and four used a nightguard. Bridges were bonded using a rubber dam and Panavia V5 resin cement after grit-blasting zirconia, etching the enamel (n = 13) or Vita Enamic palatal veneer (n = 3), and applying an MDP-based primer. The survival rate was 100% after a mean follow-up of 3.0 ± 2.6 years (range: 1 month-9.5 years). An Z-RBFDP on an upper canine showed debonding after 2 years, and the bonding procedure was successfully repeated. Patient-reported outcomes were positive. Key considerations included restoration design, material selection, bonding procedures, and multidisciplinary soft tissue management. An innovative 3D-printed resin guide was introduced to ensure accurate bridge positioning during the bonding procedure, and the simple orthodontic extrusion technique was used to manage the limited occlusal space.
This case series provides proof of principle for no-prep Z-RBFDPs, demonstrating high survival and success rates, even in the presence of known risk factors such as bruxism and unfavorable occlusal relationships.
No-prep Z-RBFDPs offer a promising, noninvasive, cost-effective, and straightforward alternative to dental implants for single-tooth replacement. They effectively avoid related complications such as infraposition and peri-implantitis. Further research is required to validate these preliminary findings, particularly for posterior applications. Treatment choices should increasingly align with the patient's preference for noninvasive procedures that prioritize tooth tissue preservation and avoid surgical interventions, as demonstrated in this case series.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39943700/

Dentin specimens were abraded with a 600-grit silicon carbide (SiC) paper for 1 min (sound dentin - S), subsequently treated with 2% CHX for 1 min (with excess removed, followed by a 6-hour rest), and eroded by exposure to Coca-Cola for 5 min, three times a day, for 5 days (CHX-treated and eroded dentin - CHXE), or only eroded (eroded dentin - E). The specimens were acid-etched (15 s), rinsed (30 s), dried (15 s), and rehydrated with 1.5 μL of distilled water for 1 min, with excess removed (control - S.C/CHXE.C/E.C) or 2% CHX (S.CHX/CHXE.CHX/E.CHX). Adper Single Bond 2 was scrubbed twice on the surface for 15 s each and then light-cured for 10 s, and resin composite cores were built up. Specimens were sectioned into beams and microtensile bond strength was tested (μTBS; 0.5 mm/min) immediately or after 18-month aging. Failure modes were analyzed using a digital microscope. Data (μTBS/MPa) were analyzed by three-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test (α = 0.05). μTBS to E and CHXE, irrespective of the rehydration solution and aging period, were equivalent to each other and lower than that to S. CHX as the rehydration solution reduced immediate and long-term µTBS to S. Aging reduced μTBS. By controlling tooth wear or interface aging, CHX could not influence long-term bonding to eroded dentin.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39813483/
39739701,Influence of chlorhexidine dentin disinfection on universal adhesive performance: Interfacial adaptation and bond strength assessments.,PloS one,2024,"Turkistani A, Sonbul HM, Almarzouki M","This study aimed to investigate the effect of chlorhexidine (CHX) cavity disinfectant on interfacial microleakage and micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) of a universal adhesive bonded to dentin in both self-etch (SE) and etch-and-rinse (ER) modes.
Class I cavities were prepared in the coronal dentin of extracted human teeth and assigned to two etching modes (SE or ER), then subdivided by disinfection with or without CHX (n = 5). Cavities were restored using Single Bond Universal Adhesive and Filtek Z350 XT composite. After 10,000 thermal cycles, interfacial microleakage was assessed on serial B-scans obtained for each specimen using cross-polarization optical coherence tomography. For μTBS testing, resin composite was bonded to dentin discs, sectioned into beams, and subjected to tensile load until failure using a universal testing machine. Failure modes in fractured beams were analyzed under a stereomicroscope and categorized as adhesive, cohesive, or mixed. ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc at a significance level of 0.05 was used to compare the groups.
Microleakage was not significantly influenced by the etching mode or CHX disinfection (p-value = 0.068). For μTBS, the ER group exhibited the highest values, and CHX disinfection did not significantly alter these results (p-value = 1.000). In contrast, the SE-CHX group displayed significantly lower μTBS than the ER, ER-CHX, and SE groups (p-values of <0.001, <0.001 and 0.012, respectively). ER mode primarily resulted in adhesive failures, regardless of CHX. SE group exhibited both adhesive and cohesive failures, while SE-CHX mostly showed adhesive failures.
The use of CHX disinfectant influences the bonding performance of universal adhesive differently depending on the application mode. Specifically, in the SE mode, CHX adversely affects bond strength to dentin. This suggests that when using universal adhesives in SE mode, clinicians should carefully consider the use of CHX disinfectants, as they may interfere with the adhesive's effectiveness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39739701/

However, achieving an effective and durable bond with enamel is challenging because of its chemical inertness and low surface energy, and data on the effects of different surface treatments on the durability of PEEK-enamel bonds are scarce.
The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate airborne-particle abrasion, sulfuric acid etching, and the combined use of these treatments on the bonding durability of PEEK-enamel bonds and to gain a deeper understanding of their bonding mechanism.
Sixty specimens were divided into 6 groups based on different surface treatments: untreated, sulfonation for 30 seconds, sulfonation for 60 seconds, airborne-particle abrasion, airborne-particle abrasion and sulfonation for 30 seconds, and sulfonation for 30 seconds and airborne-particle abrasion. Comprehensive evaluations were carried out on the surface morphology and physicochemical properties of the pretreated PEEK. After screening out the preferred surface treatment strategy of PEEK, the durability of PEEK-enamel bonds after thermal cycling (10 000 cycles at 5 to 55 °C) and the bonding mechanism were investigated by bond strength testing, cross-sectional topography, molecular dynamics,and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Data were analyzed by 1-way analysis of variance, Weibull analysis, and the Fisher exact test (α=.05).
The shear bond strength of the 98% sulfuric acid etching group for either 30 seconds or 60 seconds was significantly higher than that of the other groups (P<.05). Intermolecular hydrogen bonding was found between PEEK and the methyl methacrylate- (MMA-) containing adhesive resin. Cross-sectional topography showed that the adhesive resin infiltrated into the pores of the sulfonated PEEK, thereby forming micromechanical locking at the bonded interface. The bond strength between the enamel and PEEK treated with 98% sulfuric acid for 60 seconds was found to be more reliable than that observed in the group treated with 98% sulfuric acid for 30 seconds after aging (P<.05).
PEEK pretreated by 98% sulfuric acid etching for 60 seconds presented the best physicochemical properties.

Adhesives were applied: 1- to phosphoric acid-etched dentin (Control), 2- after NAPP application for 45 seconds to etched dentin or 3- after REHY with water (10 seconds) of plasma-treated etched dentin. BS was performed using human molars and microtensile test, in which specimens were tested after 24 hours or one year (n=6). BS data were analyzed by three-way mixed ANOVA and Bonferroni's test (α=0.05). The morphology of etched dentin (n=3) and the dentin-adhesive interfaces (n=3) were evaluated using SEM. NAPP and REHY did not increase the BS of GBU and PBU. The BS of SBM to etched dentin not treated with NAPP (Control) reduced significantly after one year. The PBU adhesive showed the highest bond strength to dentin when the adhesives tested were applied after REHY. Phosphoric acid demineralized dentin to a depth of 5 mm that allowed the adhesive penetration into the dentinal tubules, forming the resin tags. Interfacial structures were maintained after one year. Argon plasma treatment was not beneficial in increasing the dentin bond strength of adhesives to etched-dentin at 24 hours. However, rehydration after plasma application prevented the bond strength reduction for three-step adhesive after one year.

O adesivo PBU apresentou maior resistência de união à dentina quando os adesivos testados foram aplicados após REID. O ácido fosfórico desmineralizou a dentina até uma profundidade de 5 mm que permitiu a penetração do adesivo nos túbulos dentinários, formando tags de resina. As estruturas interfaciais foram mantidas após um ano. O tratamento com plasma de argônio não foi benéfico no aumento da resistência de união dentinária dos adesivos à dentina condicionada em 24 horas.

Search of the literature was performed on PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science with keywords related to the structure of the dental substrate, HL degradation mechanisms and strategies to contrast them.
Albeit the advances in the dental materials' properties, HL degradation is still a relevant and current issue in adhesive dentistry. However, adhesive materials have become more resistant and less operator sensitive, and good adhesion is currently in the hands of every practitioner. Numerous novel strategies are being developed, able to improve the resistance of adhesive resins to degradation, their ability to infiltrate and chemically bond to dentin, to remove the unbound/residual water within the HL, reinforce the dentin collagen matrix, and inhibit endogenous metalloproteinases. Many of the strategies have turned to nature in search for powerful biomodifying compounds, and for the inspiration as to mimic naturally occurring regenerative processes.
Extensive knowledge on the structure of the dental substrate and the complexity of adhesion to dentin has led to the development of improved formulations of dental adhesives and numerous valid strategies to improve the strength and longevity of the HL.

Group 1 (control group) received giomer sealant (Beautisealant, Shofu, Kyoto, Japan) without an etching step, and group 2 (intervention group) received the same but with a separate preparatory etching step before the sealant application. The retention rate of the sealant was assessed over one year at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Intergroup comparison between categorical variables was done using the chi square test, while intragroup comparison was done using Cochran's q test followed by multiple comparisons. Relative risk was used to evaluate the clinical significance. Survival rate was analyzed using Kaplan-meier and Log-rank test.
Intergroup comparison between both techniques revealed statistically significant difference within different follow up periods (P < 0.05). Intragroup comparison within both giomer sealant with etching group and giomer sealant without etching group revealed statistically significant difference between different follow-up periods (P < 0.001). There was 69% less risk for total loss or partial loss of giomer sealant with etching when compared to giomer sealant without etching after 12 months.

39455964,Fiber post cemented using different adhesive strategies to root canal dentin obturated with calcium silicate-based sealer.,BMC oral health,2024,"Patthanawijit L, Yanpiset K, Saikaew P, Jantarat J","Calcium silicate-based sealer has favorable properties for root canal filling, including hydroxyapatite formation during the setting process. However, this process can cause difficulty during post space preparation when the sealer is set. Additionally, the remaining sealer could interfere with the bond strength of fiber post to root canal dentin. The different adhesive strategies and fiber post cementation time may affect the bond strength of the fiber post. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of etching modes of Scotchbond™ Universal Plus adhesive and post cementation time on the push-out bond strength of a fiber post cemented in root canals obturated with calcium silicate-based sealer.
Fifty-four teeth were randomly allocated to 6 groups (n = 9) based on etching modes: self-etch (SE) or etch-and-rinse (ER); post space preparation and cementation time: immediate (Im) or 7-day delayed (De): Im-Im, Im-De, and De-De. The root canals were obturated with calcium silicate-based sealer and the post space preparation was performed. The fiber post was cemented using RelyX™ Universal resin cement according to each group's design. For the push-out bond strength test, 1-mm slices of the coronal, middle, and apical regions were tested using a universal testing machine. The failure mode analysis was determined using a stereomicroscope. The data was analyzed with three-way analysis of variance.
No negative effects of etching modes, post space preparation or cementation time on push-out bond strength were detected (p > 0.05). Additionally, the root canal region also did not significantly affect the bond strength (p > 0.05).
No significant differences were observed between the etching modes, post space preparation and cementation time and among root canal regions.
The different etching modes of adhesive and post cementation time did not affect the bond strength of fiber post in calcium silicate filled-root canal.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39455964/

This study assessed bond strength (BS) using microtensile (µTBS) and microshear (µSBS) tests on sound and post-radiotherapy dentin, with dental adhesives containing different functional monomers.
Sound dentin (SD) and post-radiotherapy irradiated dentin (ID) were tested with two adhesive systems: Clearfil SE Bond (SE, 10-MDP-based) and FL Bond II (FL, containing carboxylic and phosphonic monomers with S-PRG bioactive particles). The tests occurred initially (24 h) and six months later; fracture mode was also analyzed (40x). Ninety-six human molars were randomly assigned (n = 12), and half were irradiated with a 70 Gy radiation dose. For µTBS test, teeth were bonded, restored and sectioned them into beams (0.64 mm
µTBS showed a significant substrate x adhesive interaction (p < 0.001), while µSBS was significant for all factors (p = 0.006). SE and FL performed better on SD and ID, respectively, in the µTBS test. As for µSBS, SE showed higher values on ID (p < 0.05). Lower BS values occurred for SD-FL and ID-SE after six months.
Dental adhesive performance varied based on substrate type and test method. FL was more stable for ID in µTBS, while SE excelled in µSBS.
As post-radiotherapy irradiated dentin becomes more vulnerable, self-etching systems based on functional monomer and bioactive ingredients may exhibit appropriate bonding to this altered substrate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39453555/

This study compared the shear bond strength between a self-etching resin cement (Panavia F 2.0) and a millable cobalt-chromium alloy (Ceramill Sintron) following various surface treatments. A total of 40 cylindrical alloy cores (6 mm in diameter × 8 mm in height) were milled and assigned to 1 of 5 groups for different surface treatments (n = 8): control (no surface treatment); sandblasting; metal primer; sandblasting + metal primer; or acid etching. Resin cement was then used to bond cylindrical composite resin specimens to the pretreated core surfaces. The specimens underwent a 1500-cycle thermocycling procedure and shear bond strength testing. The data were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The mean (SD) shear bond strength values in the different surface treatment groups were significantly different (P < 0.05): sandblasting, 16.59 (7.10) MPa; acid etching, 15.63 (2.94) MPa; sandblasting + metal primer, 13.28 (1.27) MPa; metal primer, 8.90 (2.08) MPa; and control, 8.86 (3.57) MPa. The mean differences in shear bond strength values were significant between the sandblasting and control groups (P = 0.003) and between the acid-etching and metal primer groups (P = 0.013).

Blocks of ZLS were sectioned to obtain a total of 90 specimens (1.5 mm thick), which were assigned to 9 different surface treatment protocols (n = 10). Either hydrofluoric acid (HF) surface conditioner or ammonium polyfluoride self-etching ceramic primer (Monobond Etch & Prime [MEP]) was used for surface treatment and then combined with different bonding strategies (Monobond N silane-based universal primer, Prosil silane coupling agent, Ambar Universal APS self-etching adhesive, and/or Signum Zirconia Bond methyl methacrylate-based bonding system [SZB]) and luting agents (Allcem or Multilink Automix dual-curing resin cement). Composite resin cylinders were bonded to ZLS with each of the cementation protocols, and the specimens were subjected to 6000 thermal cycles from 5°C to 55°C prior to the μSBS evaluation. The failure mode was analyzed with the aid of a stereoscopic loupe. Statistical analyses were performed with 1-way analysis of variance and Tukey HSD test (α = 0.05). The HF and MEP protocols resulted in significantly higher μSBS values (P < 0.001), while conditioning with SZB resulted in the lowest μSBS. Multilink Automix groups presented higher μSBS values than Allcem groups (P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the μSBS values of the MEP + Allcem groups based on whether or not an adhesive layer was applied. The failure mode was predominantly adhesive for all specimens. The results indicate that the ammonium polyfluoride-based material MEP may be used as a substitute for surface treatment with HF and silane, but the use of a zirconia primer alone is not advised for bonding to a ZLS ceramic material.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39451085/

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of dentin sealing by adhesives containing propolis by quantifying the area of water transudation from dentinal tubules after dentin hybridization. Brazilian red propolis was added to experimental adhesive and Single Bond (3M/ESPE) adhesive; experimental adhesive and Single Bond without propolis were used as controls. Under simulated pulp pressure, two layers of adhesive were applied to etched human dentin discs. Three minutes after light-curing, the hybridized dentin surface was replicated, and epoxy resin replicas were created to obtain scanning electron microscope images. Data were evaluated using ANOVA and Tukey's test. Single Bond containing propolis significantly decreased water permeation through the hybrid layer compared with the control group. Three minutes after polymerization, the experimental adhesive without propolis had formed a permeable hybrid layer. The addition of Brazilian red propolis significantly reduced surface water on hybridized dentin in a concentration-dependent manner.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across electronic databases, including Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus and ProQuest.
Fifty-four relevant articles were included in this systematic review. According to the QUIN's tool, 7 studies were rated as ""high risk of bias"", 46 studies were rated as ""medium risk"", and 1 study was rated as ""low risk"". Nineteen studies were used for meta-analyses. Mostly, APA demonstrated significantly higher bond strength compared to various etching protocols (p < 0.05). However, no statistical difference was found between APA and high concentrations (40-48 %) of hydrofluoric acid (HF) in terms of immediate- and medium-term bond strength to resin composite (p > 0.05). On enamel, an experimental hot etching solution performed significantly better than APA in short-term follow-up (p < 0.05). A novel multi-acid solution exhibited significantly higher immediate shear bond strength to resin cement than APA (p < 0.05). Variable heterogeneity, ranging from low to high, was observed.
APA remains the surface treatment with the strongest evidence in the literature and it is usually more efficacious than zirconia etching. However, highly concentrated HF and an experimental hot etching solution have demonstrated similar or significantly higher bond strength values over time compared to APA, depending on the adhesive substrate. A recently introduced multi-acid solution (Zircos-E) needs to be further explored, especially in regards to long-term bond durability.
This systematic review provides a comprehensive analysis of the existing in vitro evidence on the potential of zirconia etching and the bond durability of resin-based materials after artificial aging.

This study was designed to collect information on the attitudes and practices of Australian dentists towards composite repair.
An electronic 16-item questionnaire was distributed online on Australian clinicians' dental forum with a URL address and instructions on completing the survey. The questionnaire remained accessible for 2 months. The data collected were analysed statistically using descriptive, average rank, Pearson chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests at α = 0.05.
Repair of composite restorations was a widely accepted treatment modality among surveyed dentists. Despite this, approximately half of clinicians reported the prognosis of repaired restorations to be worse when compared to replacement. The most cited indications for repair were partial loss or fracture of the restoration, while the most common reason for repair was because this treatment modality was more conservative in terms of tooth structure removal. Most important patient factor influencing decision to repair composite restoration was caries risk of the patient (n = 50). Most significant situational factor to consider in decision whether to repair was previous (failed) attempts to repair (n = 74). The most important tooth level factor was the proximity of restoration to pulp (mean statistic rank 2.22). The most common composite surface treatment employed by participants bonding to old composite was acid etching (n = 87), and the main reason participants employed their chosen surface treatment was based on personal experience (n = 72).
The repair of composite restorations was a commonly performed procedure that is well accepted but may still be viewed as an inferior treatment to replacement by many Australian dentists. Most dentists agreed on indications for repair restorations and surface conditioning techniques, but there was wide variation in opinions overall. Due to the lack of high-quality evidence regarding composite repair techniques, dentists tend to rely on personal experience to guide their clinical decisions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39362789/

The DASs tested were Adper Scotchbond Multipurpose (MP; control), Clearfil SE Bond (SE), FL Bond II (FL), Adper Single Bond Universal (SU) and BeautiBond Xtreme (BX). They were analyzed for initial and 6-month microtensile bond strength (µTBS, n = 12), mode of failure (40 x), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface wettability (W, n = 10), and degree of conversion (DC, n = 3) via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Normal and homogeneous distribution of the data allowed their analyses through ANOVA and Tukey tests (p < 0.05).
All DASs except BX exhibited higher µTBS for S decreasing for I and E. BX demonstrated the greatest stability among the altered substrates. FL showed the most hydrophobic properties, likely due to its bioactive components. Universal DASs achieved higher DC, regardless of composition.
HEMA-free formulation combined with carboxylic and phosphoric acids in BX, achieved the most stable performance for altered substrates.
Since radiotherapy and erosion affect dentin, their characteristics compromise adhesive performance and impair the achievement of durable and satisfactory restorations.

MIH-affected enamel is often subjected to posteruptive breakdown combined or not with carious lesions, predominantly on molars, and may also affect the aesthetics of anterior teeth. As unbalanced mineral and protein contents occur, understanding these alterations is essential before selecting the most appropriate adhesive systems, while bearing in mind their limitations. In particular, when dentin is involved due to enamel breakdown, the use of functional monomer-based bonding systems present in self-etching and universal systems produce a chemical interaction that enhance the bonding.

Flat bonding surfaces were prepared on extracted human molars (320 grit surface). Using adhesive tape, a 4.5 mm bonding window was prepared on the dentin surfaces. Groups (n= 12) were prepared using the etch & rinse (ER) or self-etch (SE) modes for Adhese Universal (ADH), Scotchbond Universal Plus (SBU), and Prime & Bond active (PBA) dental adhesives (DA). For the control (C) groups, the adhesives were applied per the manufacturers' instructions with 2.0 µl or 3.0 µl of the adhesive. For the saliva-contaminated groups, 1.0 µl of artificial saliva with mucin was applied in the bonding window either dried or allowed to remain wet before the application of either 2.0 µl or 3.0 µl of the adhesive. After the adhesive film was air dried and light cured using an Ultradent bonding fixture, Spectrum TPH3 was bonded to the prepared surfaces. After water storage for 24 hours at 37°C, the specimens were debonded and shear bond strength (SBS) was calculated (MPa). A Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni correction was used to determine group differences (P< 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to visualize the interfacial surfaces prepared using an ion-etching technique.
Mean SBS for the three adhesives were similar in both ER and SE modes to uncontaminated dentin surfaces for all the control groups. For dentin contaminated with dried or wet saliva, both the surface condition and the adhesive system were significant factors at a confidence level of 95%. For the dried saliva test groups, ADH and PBA with 3.0 µl of adhesive generated similar SBS values to controls while SBU generated lower values. Lower values were generated when using 2.0 µl of adhesive for the three adhesives in SE and ER modes except for PBA in the ER mode. Using wet saliva and 3.0 µl of adhesive ADH and SBU generated lower SBS values while PBA generated similar values to controls. Under SEM, morphology at the adhesive dentin interfaces was similar among the adhesives to uncontaminated dentin but notable differences were observed for SBU and ADH for both wet and dried saliva-contaminated surfaces.
Salivary contamination differentially affects shear bond strength and the morphology of the bonded interface of universal adhesives to dentin. These differences are specific to the adhesive tested and are influenced by using the etch and rinse or self-etch strategies and the volume of adhesive used.

However, the question whether the fit and self-etching adhesive (SED) affect the success of FP restoration still remained unclear.
This research aimed to assess how the fit and self-etching adhesive (SED) impact the pull-out bond strength (BS) of glass fiber-reinforced composite posts from the root canal dentin.
Eighty lower first premolars underwent simulated endodontic treatment, after which their canals were shaped to accommodate a size three RelyX fiber post (FP) (diameter 1.9 mm). They were then divided into 4 equal groups [Unfit post and no SEA (Group UN), Fit post and no SEA (Group FN), Unfit post with SEA (Group UA) and Fit post with SEA (Group FA)] using two different sized FPs and SEA. Cement thickness was acquired by histological analysis and stereomicroscopy. Each sample was tested for pull-out strength through a universal testing machine. Based on the pull-out test, the failure types were observed and scored by visualizing through a stereomicroscope.
Group FA demonstrated significantly greater BS compared to Group UN and Group UA, with Group UN showing a statistically significant difference at p< 0.01 and Group UA at p< 0.05. Main failure types in Group FA were Type II, which illustrated that the cement detachment mainly occurred from the post-cement interface. Therefore, Group FA possessed the STRONGEST BS and was most suitable for FP-reinforced crown restorations.
Both the fit and SEA enhanced the pull-out BS. The SEA was critical for BS promotion when the mechanical retention was inadequate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39240598/

A total of 80 caries-free primary second molars were randomly assigned to eight experimental groups (n = 10) based on the bonding substrate (enamel or dentin), the application mode of the universal adhesive system (etch and rinse [E&R], or self-etch [SE]), and the type of composite resin used (bulk-fill or conventional). After bonding the composite resin to enamel or dentin, the μSBS of the bonded composite resins was measured.
The mean μSBS value of bulk-fill composite resin was significantly higher than that of conventional composite resin for both enamel and dentin substrates, regardless of the application mode (p < 0.001). An interaction effect between the bonding substrate and the application mode of the adhesive system was observed, indicating a significant relationship (p < 0.001). The highest μSBS values for primary teeth enamel were achieved using the E&R mode with bulk-fill composite resin, while for dentin specimens, the SE mode with bulk-fill composite resin yielded the highest μSBS values. The μSBS of the E&R group was significantly higher than that of the SE group for enamel specimens (p < 0.001), whereas the μSBS of the SE group was significantly higher than that of the E&R group for dentin specimens (p < 0.001).
Bulk-fill composite resin demonstrated higher μSBS in comparison to conventional composite resin. The universal adhesive system exhibited superior performance in the SE mode compared to the E&R mode on primary dentin. Pre-etching the enamel before the application of the universal adhesive enhanced the μSBS to primary teeth enamel, highlighting the importance of selectively acid etching the enamel of primary teeth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39205379/

The surface free energies (SFE) of the adherent surfaces were also determined.
Bovine enamel and dentin were used in this study. For the saliva-contamination, human saliva was applied to the adherent surface for 60 seconds and then air-dried, and the specimens without saliva contamination served as controls. One group of contaminated surfaces was untreated (SC), and the others were pretreated with Katana Cleaner (KC), Multi Etchant (ME), or Ultra-Etch (UE). Fifteen specimens were prepared to measure the SBS for each test group.The mixed resin luting cement paste was applied to the alumina-blasted surface of a stainless-steel rod and placed on the prepared tooth surface. The luting cement was light irradiated for 40 seconds. The bonded specimens were stored for 24 hours at 37°C and half of the bonded specimens underwent 10,000 thermal cycles. The SBS and SFE of the specimens after different pre-treatments were measured.
The two-way ANOVA revealed that the factors of pretreatment agent and storage condition had a significant effect on the SBS to enamel and dentin. The SFE values of the SC group were significantly lower than those of the other groups in both enamel and dentin. The SFE of pretreated surface was material dependent.

Dentin from healthy molars underwent grinding and acid etching for 15 s, followed by a 1min application of urushiol primer. After 14 and 28 days of remineralization incubation and remineralization were used to assess by Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Vickers Hardness, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Energy X-ray dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The overall performance of urushiol primers as dentin adhesives was observed by microtensile bond strength (μTBS) testing and nanoleakage assessment. Investigated the inhibitory properties of the urushiol primers on endogenous metalloproteinases (MMPs) utilizing in situ zymography, and the cytotoxicity of the primers was tested.
Based on ATR-FTIR, Raman, XRD, EM-EDS and Vickers hardness analyses, the 0.7%-Ethanol group significantly enhanced dentin mineral content and improved mechanical properties the most. Pretreatment notably increased the μTBS of restorations, promoted the stability of the mixed layer, and reduced nanoleakage and MMPs activity after 28 days.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Ninety direct nanohybrid composite resin (Tetric N-Ceram) cylindrical discs were divided into 5 groups (n=18 each) based on aging cycles (thermocycling), as follows: TC=no aging (control), T1=850, T3=2500, T6=5000, and T12=10000 cycles, representing 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of clinical usage, respectively. Lithium disilicate glass ceramic (IPS e.max Press) cylindrical discs were cemented to resin discs using resin cement (Variolink N) after surface treatments (ceramic etching, silaning, composite abrasion). Differences in means between subgroups were calculated using one-way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey honestly significant differences post hoc test. Differences were considered statistically significant with a P value ≤0.05. RESULTS The highest SBS between ceramic and aged composite was observed at 1 month (m=20.35) but did not differ significantly from the control group (m=20.97). For all other subgroups (3, 6, 12 months) SBS was significantly less than that of the control (P≤0.05). At 1 and 3 months, cohesive failures were more common, whereas adhesive failures were more common in 6- and 12-month-old composites. CONCLUSIONS SBS of aged composites was less than that of non-aged composites, with SBS decreasing proportionally as the resin aged. When cementing a ceramic restoration over existing composite restorations, those older than 1 month should be removed and replaced with new ones.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39182170/

Two experimental etch-&-rinse adhesives were formulated by incorporating 0 wt% (E0) or 20 wt% (E20) neutral MDP-Na into a basic primer. A commercial adhesive, Adper Single Bond 2 (SB, 3 M ESPE), served as the control. Sixty prepared teeth were randomly allocated into three groups (n = 20) and bonded using either one of the experimental adhesives or SB. Following 24 h of water storage, the bonded specimens were sectioned into resin-dentin sticks, with four resin-dentin sticks obtained from each tooth for microtensile bond strength (MTBS) test. Half of the sticks from each group were immediately subjected to tensile loading using a microtensile tester at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min, while the other half underwent tensile loading after 6-month incubation in artificial saliva (AS). The degree of conversion (DC) of both the control and experimental adhesives (n = 6 in each group) and the adsorption properties of MDP-Na on the dentin organic matrix (n = 5 in each group) were determined using Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry. Furthermore, the effectiveness of neutral MDP-Na in promoting the mineralization of two-dimensional collagen fibrils and the adhesive-dentin interface was explored using transmission electron microscopy and selected-area electron diffraction. Two- and one-way ANOVA was employed to assess the impact of adhesive type and water storage on dentin bond strength and the DC (α = 0.05).
The addition of MDP-Na into the primer increased both the short- and long-term MTBS of the experimental adhesives (p = 0.00). No difference was noted in the DC between the control, E0 and E20 groups (p = 0.366). The MDP-Na remained absorbed on the demineralized dentin even after thorough rinsing. The intra- and extra-fibrillar mineralization of the two-dimensional collagen fibril and dentin bond hybrid layer was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and selected-area electron diffraction when the primer was added with MDP-Na.
The use of neutral MDP-Na results in high-quality hybrid layer that increase the dentin bond strength of etch-&-rinse adhesive and provides the adhesive with remineralizing capability. This approach may represent a suitable bonding strategy for improving the dentin bond strength and durability of etch-&-rinse adhesive.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39182086/

The crowns of 90 anterior primary teeth were sectioned horizontally, 1 mm above the cementoenamel junction (CEJ). Following canal preparation with K-files, all groups except the negative control received normal saline irrigation. Canals were then irrigated with either 3% or 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 2% or 0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX) solution (except negative and positive controls). The roots were filled with Metapex material and covered with a calcium hydroxide liner. In root canals, the bond was applied by self-etching and then light-cured for 20 seconds before canals were restored incrementally with composite. Stereomicroscopes were used to assess failure patterns. Push-out bond strengths (MPa ± SD) were: 3% NaOCl (16.92 ± 5.78), 5.25% NaOCl (8.96 ± 3.55), 2% CHX (14.76 ± 5.56), and 0.2% CHX (7.76 ± 2.93). Significant differences were seen across the irrigants regarding the push-out bond strength of dentin sections (P <0.001). The most frequent failures were adhesive and cohesive. NaOCl and CHX irrigants increased the push-out bond strength compared to controls.

Three self-adhesive resin luting cements (SRLCs) were used with universal adhesives as primers. Twelve specimens per group were prepared to measure shear bond strength (SBS) under distinct luting strategies in etch-&-rinse and self-etch modes. Regarding luting strategies, the bonded specimens were categorized into four groups based on tooth primer application and the curing mode of the SRLC paste: (i) with light irradiation of the tooth primer (wL) + dual-cure mode (DC) of the SRLC paste, (ii) wL + self-cure mode (SC) of the SRLC paste, (iii) without light irradiation of the tooth primer (woL) + DC mode of the SRLC paste, and (iv) woL + SC mode of the SRLC paste. Specimens were also subjected to different storage conditions: 24 h in water (baseline condition) and 10,000 cycles of thermal cycling.
Luting strategy, storage condition, and SRLC system type significantly influenced dentin SBS values in both etching modes. Notably, certain SRLCs exhibited significantly higher dentin SBS when the primer was light-irradiated compared with no primer irradiation.

Elevated levels of G-17 and G-gly have been identified as potential risk factors, particularly in patients with duodenal ulcers. This study introduces an innovative D-shaped grinding long-period fiber grating sensor (D-LLPFGs) designed for non-invasive detection of the gastrin G-17 antigen, employing a layer-by-layer chemical self-assembly to bond G-17 antibodies onto the fiber surface through hydrogen bonding. The D-LLPFGs sensor demonstrated significant spectral shifts within 1 min of antigen-antibody interaction, highlighting its rapid detection capability. At an optimized antibody concentration of 4 μg/ml, antigen testing across different concentrations (10, 12.5, 20, 50 μg/ml) showed peak changes at 12.5 μg/ml antigen, with a 1.186 nm shift and 0.503 dB loss. The sensor exhibited a wavelength sensitivity of 0.095 nm/μg/ml, indicating its high sensitivity and potential in gastric cancer classification, diagnosis, and treatment. This research concludes that the D-shaped fiber sensor is an effective and sensitive tool for detecting G-17 antigen levels, presenting a significant advancement in non-invasive gastric cancer diagnosis. Its quick response time and high sensitivity highlight its potential for broad biomedical applications, offering a new avenue for early cancer detection and improving patient prognosis.

These pathologies affect up to 31% of the population, posing challenges in the adhesion of direct restorations. The primary objective of this analysis is to examine the survival rate and/or bonding resistance of direct restorations on tissues affected by enamel and dentin disorders in humans. We aim to provide precise clinical recommendations for dentists to choose the appropriate bonding pretreatment for various enamel and dentin disorders.
We systematically searched the medical literature to identify abstracts of interest indexed between 1993 and May 2024, from 4 databases (PubMed, PMC-PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library). The results are reported following the PRISMA statement. The GRADE approach was used to assess the risk of bias.
The two authors included 27 studies out of the 600 identified. The data extracted from these studies are highly heterogeneous, and the mentioned bonding protocols are all different. 15 articles pertain to F, 7 to MIH, 5 to AI, and none focus on HSPM, dentin disorders and XLH. We identified 12 pretreatments of enamel or dentin (7 for F, 2 for MIH, and 3 for AI), including 3 strong recommendations. Additional studies are necessary to confirm the effectiveness of certain pretreatments. In developmental enamel defects, the main recommendation we collected is to bond on enamel with an etch-and-rinse technique on F and MIH. Considerations with lower strength of evidence include a deproteinization step on enamel on F, MIH and AI and modifications of the etching parameters on F and AI.

38900462,The Selective Enamel Etch Technique.,"Compendium of continuing education in dentistry (Jamesburg, N.J. : 1995)",2024,"Koup MA, Blatz MB","Adhesive dentistry is an essential component in the delivery of direct and indirect restorations. Ongoing discussions among scientists and clinicians have focused on whether or not current self-etch and universal adhesives adequately prepare enamel surfaces to achieve optimal bond strengths. To address these concerns, a selective enamel etch technique has been recommended. The definition of a selective enamel etch technique is as its name suggests. The clinician selectively etches the enamel of a cavity preparation by applying phosphoric acid etchant to the enamel surfaces of the preparation while refraining from applying the etchant to the dentin. This article explores the current research to help guide clinicians to achieve ideal outcomes when using dental adhesives. With few exceptions, the current scientific evidence recommends a selective enamel etch technique in conjunction with the clinician's adhesive system of choice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38900462/

32 premolars with noncarious cervical lesions (NCCLs) were collected, and the teeth were randomly assigned to the control group (C group) and the sandblasted group (S group). Teeth in the S group were sandblasted with 110 µm Al₂O₃ particles at a pressure of 75 psi, while those in the C group received no further treatment. The characteristics of the tooth surface were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the relative area of open dentin tubules (OTs) was calculated by IPP6.0 software. Surface roughness (Ra) was also assessed. The noncarious cervical lesions of all teeth were restored with a resin composite and subsequently sectioned into sticks to measure the microtensile bond strength (µTBS).
The mean ± SD µTBS (in MPa) of the sandblasted group was 17.9 ± 0.69 and 14.23 ± 0.44 in the control group (P< 0.05). The relative area of OTs at the gingival wall of the sandblasted group was 69.74 ± 5.23%, and 47.24 ± 7.67% in the control group (P< 0.05). The average surface roughness (µm) was 1.01 ± 0.05 in the sandblasted group and 0.16 ± 0.03 in the control group. Sandblasting could increase the bond strength of sclerotic dentin and resin restorations.
After sandblasting, the microtensile strength of sclerotic dentin on the surface of noncarious cervical lesions increased, prolonging the resin adhesion longevity. Sandblasting could also alleviate the pain of patients during the treatment process and achieve a minimally invasive treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38899990/

The occlusal enamel of 60 third molars was cut to expose the inner one-third of the dentin. Artificial caries were induced through a pH cycling process. The samples were divided into three groups: M (Methylene blue+ diode laser), I (Indocyanine green agents+ diode laser irradiation), and control. Each group was further divided into two subgroups according to the adhesive protocol (self-etch, total-etch). After restoring with Gradia composite resin, teeth were sectioned and exposed to 5000 thermal cycles. Microtensile bond strength was measured using a universal testing machine. The data were subjected to two- and one-way ANOVA and paired comparisons were performed by the Tamhane and Tukey tests.
The study found significant effects of the photosensitizer, etching pattern, and their interactions on the microtensile bond strength of composite resin to caries-affected dentin (P < 0.001). In the self-etching mode, PDT with indocyanine green exhibited significantly higher bond strength values compared to PDT with methylene blue (P = 0.001) and the control groups (P < 0.001). However, no significant differences were observed in the total-etch mode. (P = 0.54).
The etching mode played a more significant role in the bond strength when using the universal adhesive alongside PDT with methylene blue and indocyanine green. Employing two photosensitizers in PDT during the self-etch mode significantly increased the bond strength values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38897530/

Eighty human maxillary anterior teeth were distributed into 8 groups (n = 10), according to the type of adhesive system used (etch-and-rinse and self-etch), the ultrasonic activation of the adhesive systems, and the dentin condition (irradiated or non-irradiated - 70 Gy). Endodontic treatment was performed followed by fiberglass post-space preparation. After fiberglass posts' luting, the roots were transversely sectioned on dentin discs and submitted to the push-out bond strength test (0.5 mm/min). The fractured specimens were analyzed under a stereomicroscope and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) for failure mode classification. One of the dentin discs was analyzed under SEM to evaluate the characteristics of the adhesive interface.
Irradiated specimens had lower bond strength than non-irradiated specimens (P < 0.0001). Ultrasonic activation of both adhesive systems increased the bond strength of the resin cement to irradiated dentin (P < 0.0001). Radiotherapy significantly affected the failure mode in the middle (P = 0.024) and apical thirds (P = 0.032) (adhesive failure).
Non-irradiated specimens had a more homogeneous adhesive interface. When ultrasonically activated, both adhesive systems showed a greater number of resinous tags, regardless of the dentin condition.

Material type (p = 0.001), pretreatment strategy (p < 0.001), and the interaction (p < 0.001) all had significant effects on Ra value. However, only etching on VSCP and VE surface increased SFE value significantly. Regarding SBS value, no significant difference was found among the three materials (p = 0.937), while the pretreatment strategy significantly influenced SBS (p < 0.05). Etching on VSCP specimens showed the lowest mean value among all groups, while sandblasting and silane result in higher SBS for all test materials.
The bond strength of CAD/CAM hybrid ceramic materials for milling and 3D-printing was comparable. Sandblasting and silane coupling were suitable for both millable and printable materials, while hydrofluoric etching should not be recommended for CAD/CAM hybrid ceramic materials.

Currently, the 3-step etch-and-rinse technique remains the gold standard for dentin bonding, and the bonding mechanism mainly involves a physical interaction with little chemical bonding. In this study, we have developed a siloxane-modified polyurethane monomer (SPU) with acrylate and siloxane modifications that chemically binds to both collagen and hydroxyapatite in dentin. Formulated as a bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate alternative, the SPU monomer-based adhesive was designed to improve dentin bonding quality and durability. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope, and hydroxyproline release assays were performed on SPU-treated collagen, hydroxyapatite, and acid-etched dentin slices to dentin. The physicochemical properties of the configured SPU adhesives were profiled for polymerization behavior, water contact angle, and tensile strain and strength. The bonding effectiveness was assessed through micro-tensile strength, nano-leakage tests conducted on the bonded samples before and after thermal cycle aging. Finally, we further conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments to assess the biocompatibility of adhesives. The results showed that the siloxane groups of SPU monomer could covalently bind to dentin collagen and hydroxyapatite.

The enamel etching pattern and the required quantity of these combined acids as antioxidants following 35% hydrogen peroxide (HP) bleaching were also determined.
The stability of the solution at room temperature was assessed at various time intervals. Fifty teeth were randomly divided into five groups: non-bleached (G1), bleached then acid etched (G2), bleached followed by a 10-minute treatment with 10% sodium ascorbate and acid etched (G3), 5-minute treatment with 50% ascorbic acid (G4), and 5-minute treatment with a combination of 50% ascorbic acid and 50% citric acid (G5). Groups G2, G3, G4 and G5 were bleached by 35% HP gel for a total of 32 min. Acid etching in groups G1, G2, and G3 was performed using 37% phosphoric acid (Ormco®, Orange, CA, USA) for 15 s. In all groups, metal brackets were immediately bonded using Transbond™ XT primer and Transbond™ PLUS adhesive, with light curing for 40 s. The SBS was tested with a universal testing machine, and statistical analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD test. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05 for all statistical tests.

Thus, improving the durability of dentin bonding remains a pressing issue. As a promising solution, guided tissue remineralization can induce the formation of apatite nanocrystals to repair defects in the dentin bonding interface. In this study, we present an experimental 20 wt % citric acid (CA) dental etching agent that removes the smear layer. After CA-etching, approximately 3.55 wt % residual CA formed a strong bond with collagen fibrils, reducing the interfacial energy between the remineralizing solution and dentin. CA helped achieve almost complete intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar mineralization after 24 h of mineralization. CA also significantly promoted poly(amidoamine)-induced dentin biomimetic mineralization. The elastic modulus and microhardness of remineralized dentin were restored to that of sound dentin. The remineralized interface reduced microleakage and provided a stronger, longer-lasting bond than conventional phosphate acid-etching.

Then the brackets were debonded under shear and the results were statistically analyzed by two-way analysis of variance and Holm Sidak at α = .05. The debonded surfaces of all specimens were examined by light microscopy and the Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) was recorded.
The SBS results exhibited significant differences er (p < .001). For both the T and TM the application of MP-II increased the SBS compared to respective control groups (p < .001). The T-C group was found inferior compared to PM-C (p < .001) and the same is true for the comparison between T-MP and PM-MP (p < .001). ARI indexes demonstrated that the tooth groups were characterized by a predominantly adhesive failure at the resin-dentin interface.

To ensure the long-term success of removable dentures with a PEEK framework, the base materials must be well bonded to each other.
The study aimed to investigate the effects of different kinds of surface roughening treatment on PEEK and acrylic resin bonding.
Eighty PEEK specimens (N = 80) were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 16 per group) and subjected to various surface roughening treatment (control, grinding, sandblasting, tribochemical silica coating (CoJet), and sulfuric acid etching). Heat-polymerized acrylic resin was applied to the treated surfaces of the PEEK specimens. The shear bond strength (SBS) test, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) analysis and three-dimensional (3D) surface topography analysis were performed. The statistical analysis of the data was conducted using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple comparison test.
The one-way ANOVA showed significant differences in the SBS values between the groups (p = 0.001). Sandblasting, tribochemical silica coating and sulfuric acid etching resulted in high SBS values (p = 0.001). The highest SBS values were observed in the sulfuric acid etching group (8.83 ±3.63 MPa), while the lowest SBS values were observed in the control group (3.33 ±2.50 MPa).
The additional roughening treatment applied to the PEEK surface increases the bond strength with heat-polymerized acrylic resin.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38652924/

Lithium disilicate glass ceramic discs (EMX, IPS e.max Press, Ivoclar Vivadent) measuring 10 mm in diameter and 3 mm in thickness were fabricated (n=240). Surfaces were etched using 5% hydrofluoric acid and randomly assigned to 10 groups based on the commercial brand of silane used (n=24): [RP] RelyX Ceramic Primer (3M ESPE); [PS] Prosil (FGM); [SA] Silano (Angelus); [SM] Silano (Maquira); [SU] Silane (Ultradent); [GL] GLUMA Ceramic Primer (Kulzer); [CB] Ceramic Bond (VOCO); [MB] Monobond N (Ivoclar Vivadent); [CP] Clearfil Ceramic Primer (Kuraray); and [DE] 2-step silane (Dentsply Sirona). Half of the EMXs (n=12) received a thin adhesive layer (+) after the silane and prior to resin luting agent, while the other half (n=12) did not receive an adhesive layer (-). For the microshear bond strength test (μSBS), four light-cured resin luting agent cylinders (1 mm in diameter) were created on each EMX surface. Half of these specimens were tested after 24 hours, while the other half were stored in deionized water for 6 months. The μSBS test was conducted using a universal testing machine (DL 500, EMIC) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min until failure. The obtained data underwent statistical analysis using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey test (α=0.05).
There was significant influence of the silane commercial brand on bond strength. Notably, ""universal primers"" yielded lower bond strength results compared to ""pure"" silane solutions. Water storage had a detrimental effect on microshear bond strength for certain silane commercial brands. Additionally, the application of an adhesive layer negatively impacted bond strength results for all silanes.
This study confirms the importance of both silane commercial brand and chemical composition in relation to bond strength of resin luting agents to lithium disilicate glass ceramic. Furthermore, the application of an adhesive layer may have an adverse effect on bond stability over time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38632867/

A neodynium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser has been introduced to modify the metal surface topography and improve porcelain bond strength. However, studies on the effect of laser etching on metal to porcelain bond strength are lacking.
The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine the effect of Nd:YAG laser etching on the surface roughness and wettability of and the porcelain bond strength to cobalt chromium (Co-Cr) substrate fabricated by milling and direct metal laser sintering (DMLS).
Thirty-two 0.5×3×25-mm Co-Cr specimens were fabricated by milling soft Co-Cr (M group) and DMLS Co-Cr metal powder (DML group). The surface topography of representative specimens from each study group was assessed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an atomic force microscope (AFM). All specimens were assessed for surface roughness using a contact profilometer, and for wettability with a contact angle goniometer. Half of the specimens of each study group (n=8) were subjected to surface laser etching by using a Nd:YAG laser. The specimens subjected to etching were assessed again for surface topography and wettability. All specimens in both study groups were veneered with porcelain. The porcelain bond strength was tested with a 3-point bend test in a universal testing machine. The results were statistically analyzed with 2-way ANOVA test followed by the post hoc Tukey test for pairwise comparisons (α=.05).
After etching, the M group had a higher mean ±standard deviation Ra and Rz of 2.9 ±0.6 and 17.7 ±3.2 µm and significantly better wettability and bond strength of 79 ±6 and 52 ±13 MPa. In contrast, after etching, the DMLS group had a significantly lower Ra and Rz of 7.9 ±2.4 and 41.8 ±9.3 µm and significantly lower wettability and bond strength of 87 ±4 and 70 ±10 MPa. The DMLS group had a significantly higher roughness and bond strength than the M group before and after laser etching. The SEM and AFM showed different surface topography in the study groups.
The manufacturing process of Co-Cr substrate had a significant effect on surface characteristics and porcelain bond strength. Laser etching improved the surface topography and bond strength of milled Co-Cr but not of DMLS Co-Cr.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38609765/

A literature review was performed through manual assessments. Primary sources revealing the discovery of resin curing on etched enamel were analyzed considering the research objectives and methodological procedure during that era, including the type of teeth used, preparatory measures, acid-etching process, type of resin and its application, and follow-up observations. Additionally, the political and economic contexts were examined.
In 1949, acid etching was found to promote adhesion with acrylic resin, a finding described again in 1955. The 1949 studies utilized nitric acid for enamel etching and the acrylate resin Paladon from the Kulzer company (Germany). Conversely, the 1955 investigations employed phosphoric acid and an unnamed acrylate, likely a self-curing resin supported by Kulzer in the late 1930s. Disparities in the 1949 and 1955 findings can be ascribed to varying objectives and test conditions amidst a turbulent political backdrop, significantly impacting the Kulzer company.
The discovery of resin adhesion to acid-etched enamel, approaching its 75th anniversary in 2024, is a landmark in 20th-century adhesive dentistry. Paladon represents a pioneering compound, exemplifying the influence of political, ideological, and economic factors on scientific advancements during that period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38465403/

Papain, a cysteine protease enzyme with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, can be used for deproteinization of dentin. An alternative deproteinizing enzyme is bromelain.
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of deproteinization on the shear bond strength (SBS) of composite resin to deep dentin using different concentrations of bromelain and papain.
Sixty upper premolars were extracted and randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 12 per group). In all groups, the dentin surface was etched with 37% phosphoric acid. Group 1 did not receive any enzyme treatment, group 2 was treated with a 10% papain solution, group 3 was treated with a 15% papain solution, group 4 was treated with a 6% bromelain solution, and group 5 was treated with a 10% bromelain solution. After applying an etch-and-rinse adhesive system, the specimens were restored with composite resin and the SBS was measured.
Statistically significant differences were found between groups 2 and 3 (10% papain and 15% papain, p = 0.004), groups 2 and 4 (10% papain and 6% bromelain, p = 0.017), groups 4 and 5 (6% bromelain and 10% bromelain, p = 0.021), and groups 3 and 5 (15% papain and 10% bromelain, p = 0.005).

The composite surfaces were repaired in two layers with a posterior composite. Composite sticks were subjected to a micro tensile bond strength (μTBS) test. Fractured surfaces were evaluated using a stereomicroscope (×25). Short fiber-reinforced composite samples' surfaces were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Shapiro Wilk, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey HSD tests were used for statistical evaluation.
The highest average (μTBS) values were observed in G8, whereas the lowest mean μTBS values were evident in the G1 group. Statistically significant μTBS values were found in all adhesive-applied groups when compared with the negative control group. Notably, the application of 50% DMSO without adhesive did not lead to a statistically significant increase in μTBS values. SEM images demonstrated that acid etching partially eliminated residues on the composite surface, while air abrasion had a detrimental effect on the integrity of fiber structures.
In the repair of fiber-reinforced dentin composite with a posterior composite, adhesive application is an effective approach. The treatment of 50% DMSO without adhesive did not confer a statistically significant advantage, and the supplemental use of acid etch or air abrasion did not show an additional benefit compared to adhesive-only repairs.

A thorough understanding of ZLS materials is essential for both clinicians and dental technicians. At present, the mechanical behavior and optical properties of the ZLS ceramic system have not been extensively researched, and there is still a lack of consensus regarding the fabrication process and clinical behavior of ZLS all-ceramic restorations. The aim of the present study was to present a selection of comprehensive information concerning zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate ceramics and their optical and mechanical properties, as well as to assess data regarding cementation procedures and clinical outcomes for ZLS all-ceramic restorations. Three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) were used for the research by two independent reviewers. The search was limited to articles published in the English language, as well as clinical and in vitro studies of color and studies on mechanical behavior and the cementation procedures of ZLS restorations. The exclusion criteria comprised abstracts, questionnaire-based studies, case reports, literature reviews, and studies that were not available in English. Zirconia-reinforced lithium-silicate-based ceramic presents a unique and complex microstructure that increases mechanical resistance but decreases aesthetic appearance, especially its translucency, due to tetragonal zirconia content. A material's thickness, the color of the underlying tooth structure, and the resin cement shade are important factors that influence the final shade and aesthetic appearance of ZLS restorations. Mechanical properties, which are defined by the fracture toughness, flexural strength, elastic modulus, and hardness of ZLS ceramic are higher compared to feldspathic, lithium disilicate, and hybrid ceramics, as well as resin nanoceramics; however, they are lower than translucent or high-translucency zirconia. Acid etching, sandblasting, and laser etching represent the most used methods to prepare the ZLS restoration surfaces for proper bonding procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38138238/

The intrafibrillar minerals are left intact to avoid their replacement by water that is hard for adhesive resin monomers to displace. The present work reported the synthesis of a water-soluble methacryloyloxy glycol chitosan-EDTA conjugate (GCE-MA) and evaluated its potential as an extrafibrillar demineralization agent for self-etch dentin bonding.
Glycol chitosan-EDTA was functionalized with a methacryloyloxy functionality. Conjugation was confirmed using Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy. The GCE-MA was used to prepare experimental self-etch primers. Extrafibrillar demineralization of the primers was evaluated with scaning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The feasibility of this new self-etch bonding approach was evaluated using microtensile bond strength testing and inhibition of dentin gelatinolytic activity. The antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of GCE-MA were also analyzed.
Conjugation of EDTA and the methacryloyloxy functionality to glycol chitosan was successful. The functionalized conjugate was capable of extrafibrillar demineralization of mineralized collagen fibrils. Tensile bond strength of the experimental self-etch primer to dentin was comparable to that of phosphoric acid-etched dentin and the commercial self-etch primer Clearfil SE Bond 2. The GCE-MA also inhibited soluble rhMMP-9. In-situ zymography detected minimal fluorescence in hybrid layers conditioned with the experimental primer. The GCE-MA was noncytotoxic and possessed antibacterial activities against planktonic bacteria.
Synthesis of GCE-MA brought into fruition a self-etch conditioner that selectively demineralizes the extrafibrillar mineral component of dentin. A self-etch primer prepared with GCE-MA achieved bond strengths comparable to commercial reference adhesive systems.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38065798/
38012568,In vitro performance of an autocured universal adhesive system in bonding to dentin.,BMC oral health,2023,"Kibe K, Hatayama T, Shimada Y","The successful integration of resin-based dental adhesives significantly impacts restorative dentistry, providing efficient and aesthetically pleasing caries treatments. Among various adhesives, one-step self-etching adhesives (1-SEAs) have gained popularity due to their simplicity and short application time. However, concerns have been raised regarding their bonding performance and marginal adaptation characteristics, which differ from two-step self-etching adhesives (2-SEAs) and three-step etch-and-rinse adhesives. Additionally, light-cured bonding materials may encounter challenges in deep cavities and inaccessible areas, necessitating extended light irradiation time. Autocured bonding materials are a potential solution, but limited comparative studies have been conducted on their performance.
In this in vitro study, we evaluated a new autocured universal bonding material (Bondmer Lightless 2) and compared the results with recent light-cured bonding materials. Microshear bond strength (μSBS) tests were performed on 25 human molars using five different combinations of adhesives and composite resins: Bondmer Lightless 2 with Estelite Bulk Fill Flow (BE group), Bondmer Lightless 2 with a prototype composite resin (BO group), Prime&Bond Universal with SDR flow + (PS group), Scotchbond Universal with Filtek Bulk Fill (SF group), and G-Premio Bond with Gracefil BulkFlo (GG group). The bond strengths and failure modes were assessed using a universal testing machine and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. Marginal adaptation was evaluated using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) on 40 sound bovine maxillary incisors.
The μSBS test showed no significant differences in bond strength among the tested groups. Most failure modes were observed at the bond interface between the adhesive and the dentin. The autocured bonding material demonstrated significantly higher marginal adaptation (SI%) than PS, SF, and GG. The CLSM images corresponded with gaps observed in the SS-OCT images, indicating improved marginal sealing in the autocured group.
The new autocured universal bonding material exhibited comparable bond strength to a conventional light-cured material while demonstrating a superior marginal adaptation level. This finding suggested that the autocured material could be a valuable alternative, especially when extended light irradiation would pose a challenge. Further clinical studies would be warranted to evaluate the performance of the autocured bonding material in actual restorative dental practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38012568/

This in vitro study included 156 samples from 3 brands of high-translucent zirconia split into a control group and 4 surface treatment groups: 9.6% hydrofluoric acid etching, 50-micron aluminium oxide particle air abrasion, and 30-micron tribochemical silica coating (TBS) particle air abrasion with and without silane application. After surface treatment, all groups were primed with a 10-MDP primer and bonded to metal orthodontic brackets. Shear bond strength (SBS) was tested and results were compared between all groups. Data analysis consisted of a balanced two-factor factorial ANOVA, a Shapiro-Wilks test, and a non-parametric permutation test. The significance level was set at 0.05.
Among all surface treatments, aluminium oxide particle abrasion produced significantly higher SBS (P≤0.002). Lava™ Plus zirconia samples had significantly higher SBS than Cercon® samples (P<0.0001). TBS surface treatment produced significantly higher SBS on Lava™ Plus samples than it did on the other zirconia brands (P=0.032).
This study indicated that mechanical abrasion using aluminium oxide in combination with a 10-MDP primer creates a higher SBS to high-translucent zirconia than the bond created by tribochemical silica coating. Also, there was no significant difference in ARI regardless of zirconia brand or surface preparation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37992472/

In minimally invasive dentistry, the principle behind cavity preparation is to remove external caries-infected dentin (CID) and preserve internal caries-affected dentin (CAD) and sound dentin (SD). The cavity floor is mainly composed of CAD, but the poor bonding performance of CAD has become a widespread concern. This study evaluated the performance of a new collagen-reactive monomer (ITCM) used as a primer to improve the bonding performance of CAD. The experimental specimens were grouped as follows: SD, CAD, and ITCM-pretreated CAD (CAD-ITCM). Dentin slices were obtained for attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) analysis. The bonded samples were subjected to microtensile bond strength analysis after 24 h of water storage or aging by thermocycling, and the bonding interface quality was evaluated by nanoleakage assessment, interfacial nanoindentation testing, and in situ zymography. Cytotoxicity experiments with ITCM were performed. ATR-FTIR showed that the isocyanate groups in ITCM can covalently bind and form hydrogen bonds with the collagen in CAD to mediate chemical bonding.

A total of 100 dentin samples were obtained from human molars. The teeth were cut into 3 mm-thickness discs and allocated in five groups (n=20), according to the toothpaste used: WoF - abrasion with fluoride-free toothpaste (Cocoricó); Arg - toothpaste containing arginine (Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief); Nov - calcium sodium phosphosilicate toothpaste (Sensodyne Repair and Protect); SnF - fluoride-containing toothpaste (AmF/SnCl2/SnF2 - Elmex Erosion); and Control (no erosive/abrasive process). The erosive/abrasive cycle consisted of immersion in citric acid (1%, pH 2.6, 5 min, 4×/day) and abrasion (2×/day, 120-20 sec abrasion, 100 sec immersion) with each toothpaste. During intervals, samples were immersed in artificial saliva. This cycle was performed for five days. Two resin cylinders (2 mm in diameter) were constructed on each sample for the shear bond strength test using a universal adhesive system. The self-etch and etch-and-rinse (Scotchbond Universal) strategies were employed, each in half of the total sample (n=10). Bond strength (MPa) was measured in a shear test and failure modes were assessed with a stereomicroscope. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey tests (p<0.05).
A statistically significant difference was found between the adhesive strategies tested (p<0.001), with the self-etching form showing higher values than the etch-and-rinse. Moreover, no significant differences were observed between the tested toothpastes (p=0.750) and interactions (p=0.438).
The use of toothpaste containing obliterating agents does not affect bond strength to dentin subjected to erosive/abrasive conditions when a universal adhesive is used. However, the self-etch strategy might be preferred for eroded/abraded dentin.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37909528/

The zirconia disks' surface roughness was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The surface morphology of the specimens was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the chemical composition was analyzed by energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX). Data were statistically analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test (P < .05).
Zirconia surface treatments by infiltration of nano-Si, sintering, and HF etching showed multiple changes in the surface features. The surface roughness of Groups C, S, and N were 0.88 ± 0.07 μm, 1.26 ± 0.10 μm, and 1.69 ± 0.15 μm, respectively. The surface roughness of Group N was significantly higher than that of Groups C and S (P < .05).

Resin sealants have been shown to help reduce fissure decay in both primary and permanent teeth. Etching of primary molars is not effective due to prismless enamel, higher organic content, and diversity in fissure shape. Methods of pretreatment of pits and fissures have been hypothesized to promote microporosities in etched enamel and hence sealant adherence. Examining the etching pattern and surface roughness of the enamel surface can be used to gauge these.
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of pretreatment with ozone gas and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution on pits and fissures of primary teeth to check for the etching pattern and surface roughness.
Thirty noncarious primary molars were sectioned to retain the crowns, and randomly divided into three groups, sodium hypochlorite, ozone gas, and control. Each sample was pretreated with the agent, washed, followed by etching with 37% phosphoric acid. Samples were sectioned and subjected to scanning electron microscope analysis to evaluate the etching pattern and surface roughness.
Comparison of the etching pattern in three groups showed a statistically insignificant difference (P=0.364). Surface roughness was highest in the hypochlorite group followed by ozone and control which showed a statistically significant difference (P = 0.001). The surface area between the three groups showed a statistically insignificant difference.
Sodium hypochlorite is a better pretreatment agent compared to ozone gas and acid etching alone. However, as all results were not statistically significant further research must be carried out to prove the effectiveness of these agents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37861642/

In this study, three bonding strategies were assessed - one-step self-etch (1-SE), two-step self-etch (2-SE), and three-step etch-and-rinse (3-ER) - by measuring the immediate and aged microshear bond strength (µSBS) to sound primary enamel.
120 extracted human primary molars with sound buccal surfaces were used for µSBS testing. Six adhesive protocols (two per bonding strategy) were selected and µSBS was measured either after 24 h or 10,000 thermal cycles (n = 10). Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to determine failure modes. Furthermore, 18 primary molars were etched using the different adhesive protocols (n = 3) for the measurement of surface roughness (Sa) using CLSM and morphological analysis using SEM.
After 24 h, there was no significant difference in µSBS between 1-SE and 2-SE strategies (p = 0.96), but the 2-SE strategy yielded significantly higher µSBS after thermocycling (p < 0.001). The highest µSBS was obtained using the 3-ER strategy regardless of aging (p < 0.001). The 3-ER strategy clearly exposed enamel prisms and resulted in the highest Sa (p < 0.001). In contrast, if SE strategies were used, enamel prisms were barely recognizable, and Sa was not significantly different from baseline (p > 0.95).
The 3-ER strategy is optimal for bonding to primary enamel. The etching effect of SE strategies is weaker, resulting in lower µSBS. Thermocycling revealed that the bonding durability of the 1-SE strategy is inferior to that of to multi-step strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37843501/

While it is well established that the etching effect is dependent on etching time and the acid concentration, little is known about the impact of etching time and the veneer fabrication method. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the effect that different etching-time protocols have on the intaglio surface characteristics of ultrathin ceramic veneers fabricated with either the platinum foil technique or the refractory die technique. Several replicas of an ultrathin feldspathic ceramic veneer for a maxillary central incisor were fabricated. Individual specimens were processed according to different intaglio surface-etching protocols: no etching, etching for 90 seconds, etching for 120 seconds, and etching for 150 seconds (9.6% hydrofluoric acid used for all etching groups). It was observed that the 120-second etching protocol resulted in a favorable microroughness surface pattern in the platinum foil group.

The restoration surfaces were subjected to one of the following additional surface treatments within the repair process: Control: No additional treatment; the Silane-Adhesive treatment: A separate step involved the application of a silane coupling agent after acid etching; and the Sandblast-Silane-Adhesive treatment: included intra-oral sandblasting of old composite surfaces followed by silane application. Two calibrated examiners evaluated all repaired restorations according to a modified USPHS criteria after 6 months. Comparisons of the clinical performance between the treatment groups were made using Chi-square test, while responses to cold tests before and after repair treatment were made using Wilcoxon's Signed Rank's (α = 0.05).
Of 130 cases, only 116 cases turned up for evaluation. The primary reasons for composite repair were recurrent caries and anatomical deficiencies.

Samples were excited at 405 nm and viewed through 530 nm filter. Carious samples were ground flat exposing strongly red-fluorescing (StrongRF) dentine, on which a composite cylinder was placed, using one of 4 adhesives. After 22 h in water, shear bond strength and fracture mode were analysed. StrongRF was removed; composite cylinders were placed on weakly red-fluorescing (WeakRF) dentine and tested as described above. Finally, red-fluorescing dentine was removed, and composite cylinders were placed on non-fluorescing (NonRF) dentine and tested. Composites were placed at 3 corresponding heights in controls. After 22 h in water, shear bond strength testing and fracture mode analysis were performed. Differences were tested using Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon tests (p ≤0.05).

However, when DMSO was applied, no significant decrease of μTBS or NL values was observed after four years of water storage, regardless of adhesive strategies, or dentine evaluated, when compared to immediate results.
Water-based DMSO pre-treatments not only prevent degradation of MDP-containing simplified adhesives but also serve as a potential alternative to improve long-term bonding properties to eroded dentine.

Phosphoric acid etched dentin samples and those specimens contaminated with saliva (PAED+S) attained the highest SRa values, that decreased after Katana™ Cleaner application (PAED+S+KC). In the group of dentin treated with CSEB primer, all subgroups performed similar, except in CSEB+S that attained the highest SRa values. The treatment with KC restored the original values of complex modulus of the untreated dentin. KC application produced the lowest and the highest tan delta values on PAED and CSEB groups, respectively.
Katana™ Cleaner provided equally mature dentin surfaces after any of the etching methods. Tan delta increased when Katana™ Cleaner was applied on the dentin surface previously etched and contaminated with saliva, regardless the kind of etchant, thus facilitating the dissipation of energy for elastic recoil during loading.

Dual-functional etchants were prepared by mixing 56% glycolic acid and 17% phosphoric acid and adding 1% of theaflavins (TF) or proanthocyanidins from grape seed extract (GSE). The etchant without crosslinker was used as control. The prepared human dentin specimens were treated with the 3 etchants for 30 s and analyzed for chemical interaction using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and resistance of the demineralized layer to collagenase degradation using electron microscopy (EM). Resin-dentin interfacial bonding properties were evaluated after 24 h and after 10,000 thermocycling through microtensile bond strength (μTBS), nanoleakage and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity via in situ zymography. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA and post- hoc Tuckey's test.
Compared to control, TF and GSE dual-functional etchants were able to demineralize dentin, induce collagen crosslinking and protect the demineralized layer from collagenase degradation within 30 s. High resolution EM images showed better protection with TF etchant compared to GSE. There was a significant reduction in μTBS and an increase in nanoleakage and MMPs activity in control after thermocycling (p < 0.05) while these changes weren't seen in dual-functional etchants.
Dual-functional etchants, especially TF containing, provide collagen protection against degradation and result in stable μTBS and less nanoleakage and MMPs activity under clinically relevant conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37734971/

A total of 48 sound mandibular molars are anatomically prepared from the occlusal surface with two different thicknesses (1.0 and 0.5 mm). CAD/CAM zirconia-reinforced glass ceramic blocks (Vita Suprinity) are used for fabricating occlusal veneers. The teeth are randomly divided into two primary groups A and B (n=24) according to occlusal veneer thickness. Each group is subdivided according to surface conditioning into three equal subgroups (n=8)-subgroup HF: etching with hydrofluoric acid and ceramic primer application; subgroup APF: etching with acidulated phosphate fluoride and ceramic primer application; subgroup EP: conditioning with etch and prime only. Dual-cure adhesive resin cement (Multilink Automix) is utilized to adhesively bond the veneers. All specimens are subjected to 240,000 cycles of dynamic load aging prior to the fracture resistance test. The fracture resistance is measured in Newton (N). The Failure mode patterns are analyzed and categorized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results are analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's Post-Hoc test, followed by a one-way ANOVA for each factor. That is in addition to one-way ANOVA for surface treatment under each thickness, each followed by Bonferroni's Post-Hoc test. Then, a T-test is used to compare the two thicknesses under each surface treatment. All tests are set at 0.05 significance level.
The two-way ANOVA test revealed that restoration thickness and surface treatment both significantly affect the fracture resistance values (p<0.05). The highest fracture resistance mean (2672±216N) is obtained from HF at 1.0 mm thickness, while the lowest mean (2104±299N) is obtained from APF at 0.5 mm thickness.
All test groups, regardless of thickness, demonstrated fracture resistance values that exceeded both normal and parafunctional bite forces.

Cavity preparation mode differed in respective groups. After etching, bonding; composite resin was placed and polymerized on the prepared dentine surfaces. The specimens were kept in an environment simulating oral cavity and then shear tested in a universal testing machine. The failure surfaces of the specimen teeth were subjected to SEM micrographic evaluation. The cavity prepared with diamond abrasive points had a higher shearing load at failure that was statistically significantly different from the ones prepared with laser.

The literature search was conducted until September 2022 by scanning the following databases: Embase, PubMed, Scielo, Scopus, and Web of Science. Manuscripts evaluated the bond strength of resin-based materials to permanent human dentin contaminated with blood or saliva were selected for full-text review. The risk of bias was assessed by the RoBDEMAT tool.
A total of 3750 papers resulted from the search from all databases. After the full-text reading, a total of 62 articles remained for the qualitative analysis. The contamination agents used were blood, saliva, and hemostatic agents. A great variety of protocols were used to contaminate the dentin surface, and the contamination process occurred in several steps of the bonding process, including before and after the etching process, after the primer application and after the adhesive application. Also, several decontamination procedures were tested, including reapplication of the etching material, rinsing with water, chlorhexidine or sodium hypochlorite and reapplication of the adhesive system.
Any contamination with blood or saliva impaired the bond strength of resin-based materials to dentin. Decontamination procedures including water-spray and reapplication of the bonding system could revert the impairment produced by the saliva or blood contamination. The use of hemostatic agents as a method of blood decontamination is not recommended.

Fifty-six dentinal discs (thickness = 2 mm) were obtained from the crowns of the human third molars. The disks were assigned into 4 groups and treated as follows; self-etch-control group: G-Premio universal adhesive was used in self-etch mode, total-etch-control: G-Premio universal adhesive was used in total-etch mode, self-etch-DMSO: Water-based DMSO (50% volume) was applied on the samples for 60 s followed by application of G-Premio universal adhesive in self-etch mode, and Total-etch-DMSO: The samples were etched, and then, water-based DMSO was applied on them for 60 s followed by the application of G-Premio universal adhesive in total-etch mode. Afterward, resin composite was placed on all samples and light-cured. The samples were kept in distilled water and subjected to 5000 thermal cycles. Microshear bond strength was measured using the universal testing machine and failure modes were analyzed using a stereomicroscope. Forty-eight human third molars were used for microleakage evaluation and a standardized class five cavity was prepared on the buccal surface of each tooth. The teeth were assigned into 4 groups and received aforementioned surface treatment and the cavities were filled with resin composite. After storing in water for 24 h, the samples were subjected to 5000 cycles of thermocycling and the microleakage level of the samples was evaluated using silver nitrate uptake at the bonded interface. Two-way ANOVA test was used to analyze the effect of bonding technique (self-etch/ total-etch) and DMSO pretreatment on the microshear bond strength and microleakage of G-Premio adhesive to dentin.
Bonding technique had no effect on the bond strength values (p = 0.17) while DMSO pretreatment significantly decreased the microshear bond strength of the samples (p = 0.001). DMSO application increased microleakage significantly in total-etch (P-value = 0.02) while it had no effect in self-etch mode (P-value = 0.44).
Pretreatment of dentin using 50% DMSO significantly reduced the bond strength of G-Premio Bond in both self-etch and total-etch modes. DMSO effect on microleakage depended on the etching technique; DMSO increased the microleakage level when the adhesive was used in total-etch mode while did not affect the microleakage in self-etch mode.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120504/

Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) was used to assess WSL parameters. Images were captured and then analyzed before treatment and at 2 months and 4 months after bond up. Lesion area (pixels), mean fluorescence loss (ΔF), and the number of newly developed WSLs were compared within and among the three groups. The significance level was P ≤ .05.
The mean increase in lesion area was 31.3 ± 2.8 pixels, 38.4 ± 4.3 pixels, and 119.5 ± 5.3 pixels for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P ≤ .001). For ΔF, the loss was 3.3% ± 0.3%, 4.4% ± 0.2%, and 6.6% ± 0.2% for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These changes were significantly different (P ≤ .01 to P ≤ .001). The incidence of newly developed lesions was 9.5 WSLs in group 1, 10 WSLs in group 2, and 15.9 WSLs in group 3.

The study consisted of ninety sound human upper premolars (extracted for orthodontic purpose) fixed in a self-cure acrylic block and segregated into three groups of 30 samples each. 0.022 slot metal MBT brackets (Gemini series-3M unitek) were bonded with self-etch primer using Transbond XT composite, CA, USA and light cure for 40 seconds) on clean buccal surface. Teeth were divided into 3 groups-Group A/Control group, Group B, Group C. A computer was used to record the force applied to debond the bonded bracket in the unit of Newton. The analysis of variance indicated that there were significant differences (F value = 6.891, p value=0.002) in bond strengths between the various groups tested. The highest value of shear bond strength occurred when chlorhexidine (Group C) was used to remove the blood contamination (mean=15.874 MPa). When bonding was done in ideal condition (Group A), shear bond strength obtained was slightly lower (mean=14.497 MPa) as compared to Group C. On the other hand, lowest shear bond strength among all three groups occurred when blood contamination (Group B) was removed with water (mean=11.059 MPa). Analysis of the study showed that shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets to enamel significantly decreased during bonding with self-etch primer in blood contamination condition. Self-etch primer displayed considerably superior performance with the use of chlorhexidine instead of water to wash the blood contamination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37002770/

Exposed dentin surfaces of extracted human third molars were randomly assigned to 3 groups depending on sealer type (AH Plus [Dentsply DeTrey], CeraSeal [Meta Biomed Co.], and EndoSeal MTA [Maruchi]). Half of the samples were treated with PA for 30 seconds, and the other half were cleaned with water. Completely untreated specimens were used as controls. Self-etching adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond, Kuraray) was applied and composite resin (Tetric N-Ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent) was used to create build-ups. After 24 hours, the microtensile bond strength was measured (EZ Test, Shimadzu Co.). The failure mode was determined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. One-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni correction was used to analyze the data (P < .05).
The bond strength of the water-washed dentin surfaces in the calcium silicate-based sealer groups did not differ significantly from those of the control surfaces but the PA-pretreated surfaces exhibited relatively low-bond strength. The AH Plus-treated group had lower bond strength than the control group when no PA treatment was applied, but PA treatment restored the bond strength. The adhesive failure mode was most frequently found in the AH Plus group without PA etching.
When a water-soluble calcium silicate-based sealer is used, sufficient bond strength can be obtained by washing with water alone, with no need for PA use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36965766/

The long-term success of the restoration depends on the bond strength of the restoration to the tooth and other materials; thus, surface treatment of the restoration is necessary to achieve this. But such treatment may affect the restoration strength. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of various surface treatments on the surface roughness (Ra) and the biaxial flexural strength of two CAD-CAM resin-matrix ceramics.
Thirty-six-disc-shaped specimens, each measuring 1.2 mm in thickness and 12 mm in diameter, were machined from two resin-matrix ceramic blocks (Lava Ultimate and Cerasmart) (n = 18). Based on the surface treatments, each material was divided into 3 groups: control (no treatment), 50-μm Al
No significant differences in flexural strength or Ra were found for Lava Ultimate among the surface treatment groups. For Cerasmart, only the sandblasting group showed significantly higher Ra values than the control group. Also, the Ra values for the sandblasting group were significantly higher than those for the acid etching group. The flexural strengths of the sandblasting and acid etching groups for Cerasmart were statistically similar, and both were significantly lower than the control group.
Although all of the applied surface conditioning techniques improved Ra, they had a negative impact on the flexural strength of resin-matrix ceramics. Thus, clinicians should utilize the appropriate surface treatment techniques, taking into account their effects on the surface roughness and mechanical properties of resin-matrix ceramics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36964539/

Applying cross-linking or antioxidant agents may help reverse this detrimental effect and improve adhesion to dentin. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) pretreatment and the time of adhesive bonding (24 hours vs 1 month) on the shear bond strength (SBS) of All-Bond Universal (ABU) to irradiated dentin using etch-and-rinse (ER) and self-etching (SE) modes. Flat dentin surfaces prepared from 96 extracted intact human molars were divided into 8 groups (n = 12) and bonded with ABU. In the control (CO) groups (CO/ER and CO/SE), bonding was performed on nonirradiated dentin; in the irradiated (IR) groups (IR/ER and IR/SE), bonding was performed on irradiated dentin; in the irradiated pretreated groups (IR/EGCG/ER and IR/EGCG/SE), irradiated dentin received a 0.1% EGCG pretreatment before bonding; and in the irradiated delayed bonding (DL) groups (IR/DL/ER and IR/DL/SE), bonding on irradiated dentin was performed 1 month after completion of radiotherapy. The irradiation protocol consisted of a total dose of 60 Gy with 2-Gy exposure applied 5 days per week for a period of 6 weeks. After bonding procedures were completed, the specimens were stored in 100% humidity at 37°C for 24 hours and then the SBS was tested in a universal testing machine. Data were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance and Tukey tests. There was a statistically significant difference among the 8 groups (P < 0.001). Irradiation diminished the SBS in the IR/ER and IR/SE groups compared with their controls (P < 0.001). Pretreatment with EGCG significantly increased the SBS in the IR/EGCG/ER group only (P < 0.001). The difference between the IR/ER and IR/DL/ER groups was not statistically significant, and the difference between the IR/SE and IR/DL/SE groups was marginally significant (P = 0.056). Pretreatment with EGCG after acid etching restored the SBS of ABU to irradiated dentin, resulting in an adhesive performance equivalent to that observed with nonirradiated dentin.

The literature was electronically searched in PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, Wiley, Scopus, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations databases to select relevant articles that evaluated the bond strength between contaminated zirconia and resin cements. A manual search was performed by scanning the reference lists of included studies.
All articles were published online before April 2022 and in English. Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD) between uncontaminated zirconia and various cleaning methods in two aging conditions (short- and long-term). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I-square statistics. The risk of bias of all included studies was assessed. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
Of the 1181 studies, 25 studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analyses. In short-term aging condition, cleaning contaminated zirconia with water, alcohol, or acid etching reported significantly lower bond strength than uncontaminated zirconia. For long-term aging condition, cleaning contaminated zirconia with water, cleaning agents, alcohol, or acid etching reported significantly lower bond strength than uncontaminated zirconia. Alumina air-abrasion or cleaning with sodium hypochlorite were comparable to uncontaminated zirconia for both short- and long-term aging conditions.

Resultados: A resistência de união à microtração de G1 foi significativamente menor que G2 e G3. O adesivo AU teve um desempenho pior que o sistema SBU, com exceção do G5. Falhas coesivas e mistas predominaram em G1 e G2 enquanto G3 e G5 apresentaram predominância de falhas adesivas. Conclusões: Os adesivos universais representam uma inovação interessante, mas ainda há dúvidas sobre seu desempenho, principalmente em relação aos diferentes protocolos fornecidos pelos fabricantes.

The new self-etch monomers based on phosphonic acid functional groups were synthesized through a two-step procedure. First, phosphoric anhydride, poly-phosphoric acid, and polyethylene glycol were reacted to produce phosphate ester precursor (P-PEG-P). Next, allyl 2, 3-epoxypropyl ether was reacted with P-PEG-P to synthesize allyl self-etch monomer. Glycidyl methacrylate was also reacted with P-PEG-P to synthesize a methacrylate self-etch analogue monomer. The monomers were characterized using FTIR and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The viscosities of monomers were measured using a rheometer. The degree photopolymerization conversion of monomers was measured using FTIR spectroscopy. The pH assay was performed by a digital pH-meter. The etching behavior of the monomers on human teeth was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to evaluate the possible interaction of the monomers with tricalcium phosphate (TCP). The solubility of synthesized monomers was examined in ethanol, acetone, and water. The hydrolytic stability of cured resins in artificial saliva during 4 months was also surveyed. The synthesis of new self-etching monomers was successfully confirmed by spectroscopy analyses. The results represented appropriate viscosity of self-etching monomers around 1 (Pa s). The resin containing methacrylate monomer exhibited its degree of conversion is more than that of allyl monomer (p < 0.05). The allyl and methacrylate self-etch monomers exhibited pH values of 1.2 and 1.3, respectively. SEM micrograph verified that the synthesized monomers were able to suitable etching of the enamel human premolar teeth. The data obtained from TGA tests revealed that thermal stability of (TCP) containing monomers is enhanced. Also, the monomers exhibited an excellent solubility in polar solvents, but when they are mixed with TCP, they are not, anymore, dissolved in these solvents. Furthermore, the allyl monomer showed higher hydrolytic stability than the methacrylate monomer. The new photo-polymerizable acidic monomer based on allyl functionality showed enhanced hydrolytic stability compared to methacrylate-based monomer.

Surface microhardness (Knoop) was evaluated before and after etching, and microtensile bond strength was evaluated after application of a two-step adhesive system (Adper Single Bond 2, 3M ESPE) at 24 hours and 12 months storage time points. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test showed a decrease in the microhardness values for both substrates after application of each acid (p<0.0001). The reduction percentage was significantly higher for enamel treated with phosphoric acid (59.9%) and glycolic acid (65.1%) than for ferulic acid (16.5%) (p<0.0001), and higher for dentin that received phosphoric acid (38.3%) versus glycolic acid (27.8%) and ferulic acid (21.9%) (p<0.0001). Phosphoric and glycolic acids led to homogeneous enamel demineralization, and promoted the opening of dentinal tubules, whereas ferulic acid led to enamel surface demineralization and partially removed the smear layer. The adhesive-enamel interface showed micromechanical embedding of the adhesive in the interprismatic spaces when phosphoric and glycolic acids were applied. Ferulic acid showed no tag formation.

These specimens were subjected to micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) testing at 24 hours, 6 months, and 20 months, after 30 seconds of pretreatment with CHX or W, followed by self-etching and bonding (Adper Single Bond Universal, 3M ESPE). Modes of failure were assessed using optical microscopy (40×) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results were analyzed by 3-way ANOVA and Tukey's statistical tests (α=0.05).
Substrate (p<0.001), pre-treatment (p=0.0413), and time (p<0.0001) were statistically significant. The sound-dentin group in initial time (W=39.27/CHX=40.55) yielded the higher μTBS values (MPa) in comparison with altered substrates pre-treated with CHX (E-CHX=19.84; C-CHX=18.24) after 20 months, which showed the lowest values. Under SEM analysis, heterogeneous patterns appeared in the hybrid layer of the CHX-treated group, particularly in the altered substrates.
Bond strength to dentin decreased over a period of 20 months using UA with 10-methacryloyloxydecyl-dihydrogen phosphate (MDP) in self-etching mode. Substrates altered by erosion or caries have impaired adhesion and associated clinical use of UA with MDP and CHX should be avoided.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36656311/

One-step self-etching adhesives with various weight percentages of silver 2-ethylhezanoate (0%, 0.05%, 0.10%, and 0.20%) were obtained by in-situ synthesis; the sizes and distribution of the AgNPs in resin were observed. The antibacterial effects of dentin-resin specimens were assessed by various test methods after being aged for 1 week to 1 year. The microtensile bond strength (μTBS) and interfacial nanoleakage (NL) were evaluated using extracted human teeth after being aged for 1 day and 1 year.
Uniform distribution of AgNPs in resin was observed in all experimental groups, and the average size was 4.71 nm-4.81 nm. All groups containing AgNPs showed significant antibacterial differences from the control group (P<0.05) over the ageing of 1 year. Although the increase of concentration tended to improve antibacterial activity, significant differences were not observed between the 0.10% and 0.20% groups (P>0.05). No significant differences were observed between all experimental groups and the control group in μTBS testing and NL testing at 1-day and 1-year time points (P>0.05).
0.10% AgNPs synthesized in situ might be appropriate to impart a long-term antibacterial ability to the one-step self-etching adhesive, without affecting its adhesive performance.
This study suggests that in-situ synthesis of AgNPs is an effective method to improve the antibacterial ability of dental adhesives with the potential to inhibit secondary caries.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36626977/

No cavity preparation was performed. After 2 years, the restorations were evaluated using the modified USPHS criteria for retention, marginal adaptation/ staining, postoperative sensitivity and secondary caries. The results were analyzed using Fisher's exact test and Kruskal-Wallis test.
All groups showed 100% retention rate, except G1, who lost two restorations (p > 0.05). Regarding marginal adaptation, G1 showed greater deficiency, as only eight restorations (40%) remained intact (p < 0.05). Regarding marginal staining, G1 and G2 showed higher rate, as only 12 restorations (65%) in each one were free of staining (p < 0.05). All groups showed similar results for postoperative sensitivity and secondary caries (p > 0.05).
The association of HEMA and 10-MDP monomers in the self-etching adhesives did not influence the clinical performance of the NCCL restorations with respect to retention, postoperative sensitivity, and incidence of secondary caries. However, positively influenced the marginal adaptation and marginal staining at the 2-year follow-up.

The performance of the restorations was assessed in terms of longevity (survival) and esthetics (success) over a 20-month period. The secondary objective was to employ a novel digital method to quantify preoperative tooth structure loss. Sixty-one fractured maxillary incisors in 55 patients were included in the study. The teeth were photographed with a digital single-lens reflex camera equipped with a macro ring flash. The amount of lost tooth structure was calculated with digital photography software. The teeth were restored with a nanohybrid composite resin and self-etching adhesive system bonding agent. To assess esthetics, color change in the blue-yellow axis (Δb*) of the composite resin restoration was evaluated digitally with the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) L*a*b color system. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess Δb*, and a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess the longevity of the restorations. The study findings showed a statistically significant difference between pretreatment and posttreatment b* values (P < 0.05), but the difference was too small to be clinically perceptible to the human eye. A total of 5 restorations (9.8%) failed. The remaining restorations survived for a mean (SD) period of 18.6 (4.4) months. The log-rank test did not show any significant association between the amount of residual tooth structure and success of the restoration.

The average age of the 86 individuals included in this study was 17 years 4 months. After the removal of the orthodontic appliances, the lingual retainers, which were made of six-stranded stainless steel wire, were bent and bonded onto the lingual surface of all mandibular anterior teeth. The study was performed using a split-mouth design. In the study group, the SEP was administered to the teeth's lingual surfaces. In the control group, they were etched using 37% phosphoric etchant liquid gel. After etching, the primer was applied. The adhesive resin was applied and the retainer was fitted. The patients were re-evaluated over 24 months. The first bond failures and the amount of adhesive remaining on the tooth were recorded as the adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the bond failure rates (P = 0.231) and ARI scores between the groups (P = 0.162). The survival rates of the retainers were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier test (P = 0.237). The significance level was P < 0.05.
The bond failure rates, ARI scores, and survival rates did not differ significantly between the groups.
The results of this study demonstrated that an SEP can be used successfully in mandibular lingual retainer bonding. In situations where saliva isolation is difficult, bonding a fixed lingual retainer with SEP is recommended.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36581875/

A thorough search of Internet databases was conducted without language restrictions, and the search ran up to and including April 2022. The illegible records citations were checked for more relevant clinical studies.
The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared self-adhesive luting resins with total-etch, selective-etch, or self-etch adhesives regarding postoperative sensitivity, incidences of debonding, and survival rates of indirect restorations. From 1732 records, 9 RCTs met the eligibility criteria. Three RCTs compared total-etch adhesive to self-adhesive luting resin for intracoronal restorations, one RCT compared selective etch to self-adhesive luting resin for inlays, and 5 RCTs compared self-adhesive to other protocols for partial ceramic crowns. Postoperative sensitivity showed a non-statistically significant difference between SA and other adhesive protocols, SA revealed a non-statistically significant difference in debonding and survival to TE, but a lower statistically significant difference to Sle, SleSA, and SE.
Postoperative sensitivity might not be affected by the adhesive protocol. In relatively short observation, TE revealed comparable survival to SA for intracoronal restorations. SE and Sle exhibited the best clinical outcomes, followed by SleSA. Selective etch, and self-etch adhesives are preferable to self-adhesive resins.

Specimens of PICN (n=10) and ZLS (n=10) were submitted to four surface treatment groups: 1) 5% hydrofluoric acid etching (HF) + silanisation (SI); 2) Air abrasion (AB)+HF+SI; 3) HF + universal adhesive (UA); 4) AB+HF+SI+UA. The treated specimens were bonded with resin cement cylinders and tested in SBS after 24 h and one year of water storage. Data were assessed by ""analysis of variance"" (ANOVA) and Tukey test (α=0.05) and failure modes were classified. No significant differences were observed among treatments at each evaluation time (p>0.05). SBS decreased after one year of storage, except for PICN treated with HF+UA (p=0.068). Air-abraded groups displayed a lower SBS reduction for ZLS. PICN and ZLS exhibited predominantly adhesive and mixed failures, but at one year, PICN cohesive failures increased. In conclusion, HF+UA is an effective surface treatment for PICN, while the combination AB+HF+SI+UA was more appropriate for ZLS.

Each group was further divided into 6 subgroups according to universal adhesives - SBU (Single Bond Universal), OPU (OptiBond Universal), CBQ (Clearfil Universal Bond Quick) - and etching mode, either etch-and-rinse (ER) or self-etch (SE). Following adhesive application, composite was placed in two increments and light cured. The specimens were stored in distilled water at 37°C for 24 h. The µTBS test was performed using a universal testing machine. Failure mode was assessed using a light microscope. The data were statistically analyzed using three-way ANOVA followed by Scheffe's test (p < 0.05). The resin-dentin interface was observed using scanning electron microscopy.
Significantly lower bond strength was observed when the universal adhesives were bonded to contaminated dentin in SE mode (p < 0.05). In contrast, the µTBS of the universal adhesives in ER mode was not affected by contamination (p > 0.05). The µTBS of CBQ to contaminated dentin was significantly lower than that of the other adhesives. Observation of the resin-dentin interface revealed limited resin penetration when the universal adhesive was applied in SE mode on contaminated dentin.

We evaluated the effect of hot-etching with 9% hydrofluoric acid (HF) gel using the Zirconia Etchant Cloud System on zirconia surfaces and the consequent shear bond strength (SBS) of different resin cements to such surface-treated zirconia ceramics. Materials and Methods: Forty-five zirconia specimens were randomly assigned to surface-treatment groups (n = 15/group): no treatment (control, CT); sandblasting with 110-μm Al2O3 at an air pressure of 1 bar for 10 s (SB); hot-etching with 9% HF gel (HE). Post-treatment, specimens were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface roughness (SR) analysis. After treatment, self-adhesive resin cements (Maxcem Elite, MAZIC Cem, RelyX U200, 3M ESPE: Maplewood, MN, USA) were bonded to zirconia specimens, which were stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 h. All specimens were then subjected to SBS testing, using a universal testing machine, until failure. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s post hoc test (α = 0.05). Results: In the SEM images, roughness was greater in SB than in HE specimens. Ra and Rt values were highest in SB, followed by HE, and CT specimens.

To compare the bond failures of different orthodontic materials based on the results of available clinical studies.
A systematic search of clinical trials was performed in the Cochrane, Embase, and Pubmed databases with no limitations. The list of investigated techniques contained conventional acid-etch primer (CM-AEP), self-etch primer (SEP), self-cure resin (SCR), and simple or resin-modified glass ionomer (RM-GIC) materials and procedures.
Clinical studies reporting the failure rate of bonded brackets after using direct adhesive techniques on buccal sites of healthy teeth were included.
Bracket failure rates from eligible studies were extracted by two authors independently. Risk ratios (RRs) were pooled using the random-effects model with DerSimonian-Laird estimation.
Thirty-four publications, involving 1221 patients, were included. Our meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in the risk of bracket failures between SEP and CM-AEP. After 6, 12, and 18 months of bonding, the values of RR were 1.04 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.67-1.61], 1.37 (95% CI, 0.98-1.92), and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.72-1.20), respectively. At 18 months, bracket failure was 4.9 and 5.2% for SEP and CM-AEP, respectively. Heterogeneity was good or moderate (I2 < 42.2%). The results of RM-GIC at 12 months indicated a 57% lower risk of bracket failure using SCR as compared with RM-GIC (RR: 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24-0.61). At 18 months, bracket failures for SCR and RM-GIC were 15.8 and 36.6%, respectively (RR: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.37-0.52, I2 = 78.9%), demonstrating three to six times higher failure rate than in the case of etching primer applications.
A major limitation of the present work is that the included clinical trials, with no exceptions, showed variable levels of risk of bias. Another possible problem affecting the outcome is the difference between the clustering effects of the split mouth and the parallel group bracket allocation methods.
The results revealed no significant difference between SEP and CM-AEP up to 18 months after application. RM-GIC had much worse failure rates than acid-etching methods; additionally, the superiority of SCR over RM-GIC was evident, indicating strong clinical relevance.

As far as we know, there still remains no related meta-analysis. To evaluate the efficacy of Er:YAG and Er,Cr:YSSG lasers etching on shear bond strength (SBS) of brackets bonded to enamel. The meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, conducted with literature search.
Twelve relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included.
The pooled analysis of SBS showed that there were no significant differences between erbium family lasers and acid etching. In the mass, we noticed they did not achieve statistical significance in the lasers etching and acid etching. However, pooled analysis of 5 studies showed the SBS bonding to enamel was lower in Er,Cr:YAG laser group compared with acid group. As a whole, there were statistical significance between erbium lasers groups and acid etching group in adhesive remnant index (ARI) aspects, which less adhesives remained can reduce damage to enamel.

This study evaluated the effect of dentin biomodification with a PA acid etchant on MMP activity, adhesive interface morphology and resin-dentin microtensile bond strength. Sound extracted human molars were flattened to expose dentin and acid-etched for 15 s according to the groups: EXP - experimental phosphoric acid; EXP+PA - experimental phosphoric acid 10% PA; TE - total-etching system; SE - self-etching system. Samples were restored with composite resin and stored in distilled water (37ºC). MMP activity and interface morphology were analyzed after 24 h by in situ zymography (n=6) and scanning electron microscopy (n=3), respectively. The resin-dentin microtensile bond strength (μTBS) was evaluated after 24 h and 6 months storage (n=6). Significantly higher MMP activity was detected in etched dentin compared with untreated dentin (p<0.05), but no difference among acid groups was found. Resin tags and microtags, indicative of proper adhesive system penetration in dentinal tubules and microtubules, were observed along the hybrid layer in all groups. There was no difference in μTBS between 24 h and 6 months for EXP+PA; moreover, it showed higher long-term μTBS compared with TE and EXP (p<0.05). The results suggest that 15 s of biomodification was not sufficient to significantly reduce MMP activity; nonetheless, EXP+PA was still able to improve resin-dentin bond stability compared with total- and self-etching commercial systems.
A proantocianidina (PA) é um biomodificador dentinário promissor devido a sua capacidade de estabilizar as fibrilas colágenas contra a degradação por metaloproteinases da matriz (MMPs); no entanto, o protocolo mais eficaz para a incorporação de PA em procedimentos adesivos ainda não está claro. Este estudo avaliou o efeito da biomodificação da dentina com um condicionador ácido contendo PA na atividade de MMPs, morfologia da interface adesiva e resistência à microtração resina-dentina. Molares humanos extraídos foram lixados para exposição da dentina e condicionados com ácido por 15 s de acordo com os grupos: EXP - ácido fosfórico experimental; EXP+PA - ácido fosfórico experimental com 10% PA; TE - sistema total-etch; SE - sistema self-etch. As amostras foram restauradas com resina composta e armazenadas em água destilada (37ºC). A atividade de MMP e morfologia da interface foram analisadas após 24 h por zimografia in situ (n=6) e microscopia eletrônica de varredura (n=3), respectivamente. A resistência à microtração resina-dentina (μTBS) foi avaliada após 24 horas e 6 meses de armazenamento (n=6). Atividade de MMP detectada na dentina condicionada foi significativamente maior em comparação com a dentina não tratada (p <0,05), mas não houve diferenças entre os diferentes ácidos. Tags e microtags de resina, indicativos de uma penetração adequada do sistema adesivo nos túbulos e microtúbulos dentinários, foram observadas ao longo da camada híbrida em todos os grupos. Não houve diferença entre os valores de μTBS de 24 h e 6 meses para EXP+PA; além disso, EXP+PA apresentou maiores valores de μTBS após 6 meses em comparação com TE e EXP (p <0,05). Os resultados sugerem que a biomodificação por 15 s não foi suficiente para reduzir significativamente a atividade de MMP; apesar disso, EXP + PA foi capaz de melhorar a estabilidade da interface resina-dentina em comparação com sistemas total- e self-etch comerciais.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36043570/

The study included 34 upper first human molars. After etching for 20seconds by using 35% orthophosphoric acid (Ultra-Etch, Ultradent Products Inc., USA) and then rinsed with distilled water for 15seconds, the adhesive (Transbond™XT, 3M™, USA) was applied and cured with the polymerization lamp (Bluephase Style, Ivoclar Vivadent, Liechtenstein) for 10seconds. Ceramic brackets (Damon® Clear™, Ormco, USA) were placed by composite (Transbond™XT, 3M™, USA) on the buccal surface of the molars. Following 24-hour storage of the samples in distilled water (WB-12, Phoenix Instrument, Gabsen, Germany) at 37°C, the brackets were debonded using a debonding plier (Damon Clear Debonding Plier, Ormco, USA). ARI and a modified ARI-scoring system were used. Three independent observers scored the ARI with the naked eye under 10x, 20x, and 32x magnifications using Stereomicroscope Stemi DV4 (Zeiss, Germany). Afterward, the digital microscope VHX-5000 (Keyence, Japan) under 50x magnification was used for the quantitative analysis of the adhesive remnants by just one evaluator. The Fleiss' Kappa-coefficient test was used to assess interrupter reliability.
Fleiss' Kappa-coefficient test show that the highest amount of agreement between observers is observed using the naked eye for both of the scoring methods P<0.001. Increasing the magnification led to the moderate decrease of inter-observer agreement. For evaluations with naked eye, a higher agreement is observed for the modified ARI score compared to the ARI scored. The agreement between the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the ARI score rose with increasing magnification.
The assessment of adhesive remnants should be done either with naked eye or under 10x magnification, as they showed the highest rate of intra-observer agreement.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35970731/

Etch-and-rinse followed by adhesive was applied to group 1, and a self-etch adhesive was applied to group 2. Er,Cr:YSGG laser (3 mJ, 100 Hz, 100 ns), (3 mJ, 100 Hz, 150 μs), and (20 mJ, 100 Hz, 150 μs) were applied to groups 3-4, 5-6, and 7-8, respectively. The laser preparation was followed by self-etch adhesives or adhesives treatment. When the composite resin had been built up on the samples, the shear bond strength was tested, and the data were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Groups prepared with nanosecond-pulse laser showed significantly higher bond strength values than the microsecond-pulse laser groups and self-etch mode group, and the SEM photographs also showed more dentinal tubules and no damage in the ablation area. The shear bond strength of long pulse laser ablated was comparable to that of self-etching system when it was combined with a self-etch adhesive at low energy, but higher energy laser degraded shear bond strength.

After sample size calculation, a sum of 40 non-carious, non-traumatically extracted and sound human premolar teeth were collected and the enamel surface was prepped by etching, washing, and drying. The enamel surface was primed with a bonding agent and light cured, later brackets were bonded via composite. After bonding, bracket debonding was begun using a Weingart plier and the enamel surface was reconditioned before rebonding. Samples were divided into four (n=10) reconditioning groups at random and subjected to SB with 90-μm alumina particles group 1, Er, Cr: YSGG laser group 2, 37% PA (control) group 3, and RF group 4 respectively. After reconditioning, brackets were rebonded to the enamel surface via an adhesive system and composite. Later, samples were exposed to the universal testing machine for SBS analysis, and bond failure analysis was performed by using an adhesive remnant index (ARI). Statistical analysis was executed by one-way ANOVA and Post Hoc Tukey multiple comparison tests at a statistically significant level of p ˂ 0.05.
The SBS analysis showed that the highest SBS of rebounded brackets was exhibited by 37% phosphoric acid (control) and the lowest SBS by sandblasting enamel surface with 90-μm alumina particles for enamel prior rebonding. However, Er, Cr: YSGG laser and RF activated by PDT validated comparable SBS results to control (p>0.05). Contrarily, sandblasting with 90-μm alumina particles showed a statistically significant difference from other analyzed reconditioning groups (p<0.05). Deliberating failure rate analysis by ARI index, the most eminent failures predicted among groups were scored between 0 and 1 except for sandblasting which majorly resulted in a score of 2 showing cohesive type failure.

A PubMed search was performed related to NCCL morphology, progression, prevalence, etiology, pathophysiology, and restoration.
NCCLs form as either rounded (saucerlike) depressions with smooth, featureless surfaces that progress mainly in height or as V-shaped indentations that increase in both height and depth. Prevalence ranges from less than 10% to over 90% and increases with age. Common locations are the facial surfaces of maxillary premolars. They have a multifactorial etiology due to personal habits such as excessive horizontal toothbrushing and consumption of acidic foods and drinks. Occlusal factors have been identified as contributing to the prevalence of NCCLs in some studies, whereas other studies indicate there is no relationship. The concept of abfraction has been proposed whereby mechanical stress from occlusal loading plays a role in the development and progression of NCCLs with publications supporting the concept and others indicating it lacks the required clinical documentation. Regardless of the development mechanism, demineralization occurs and they are one of the most common demineralization diseases in the body. Treatment should be managed conservatively through preventive intervention with restorative treatment delayed until it becomes necessary due to factors such as lesion progression, impact on patient's quality of life, sensitivity, poor esthetics, and food collection may necessitate restoration. Composite resins are commonly used to restore NCCLs although other materials such as glass ionomer and resin-modified glass ionomer are also used. Sclerotic dentin does not etch like normal dentin and therefore it has been recommended to texture the dentin surface with a fine rotary diamond instrument to improve restoration retention. Some clinicians use mechanical retention to increase retention. Beveling of enamel is used to increase the bonding area and retention as well as enhance the esthetic result by gradually creating a color change between the restoration and tooth. Both multistep and single-step adhesives have been used. Dentin etching should be increased to 30 seconds due to the sclerotic dentin with the adhesive agent applied using a light scrubbing motion for 20 seconds but without excessive force that induces substantial bending of a disposable applicator. Both flowable and sculptable composite resins have been successfully used with some clinicians applying and polymerizing a layer of flowable composite resin and then adding an external layer of sculptable composite resin to provide enhanced resistance to wear. When caries is present, silver diamine fluoride has been used to arrest the caries rather than restore the lesion.
Noncarious cervical lesions (NCCLs) form as smooth saucerlike depressions or as V-shaped notches. Prevalence values as high as 90% and as low as 10% have been reported due to habits such as excessive toothbrushing and an acidic diet. Occlusal factors have been proposed as contributing to their presence but it remains controversial. Publications have both supported and challenged the concept of abfraction. They are one of the most common demineralization diseases in the body. Conservative treatment through prevention is recommended with restorative treatment delayed as long as possible. When treatment is needed, composite resins are commonly used with proposed restorative guidelines including texturing the sclerotic dentin, beveling the enamel, potential use of mechanical retention, 30 seconds of acid etching, and use of either multistep or single-step adhesives in conjunction with a light scrubbing motion for 20 seconds without excessive force placed on disposable applicators.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35920595/

Different approaches are thus needed. The objective of this review was to determine whether the use of collagen-depletion strategies after acid-etching procedures may improve the bond strength of resin-based materials to dentin. A systematic review was planned following 2021 PRISMA statement guidelines, with a search strategy performed in five electronic databases: PubMed/Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, SciELO and IADR Abstract Archive (last search: 17/01/2022). Inclusion criteria encompassed studies which evaluated a collagen-depletion strategy in acid-etched human dentin and tensile/shear bond strength tests. Risk of bias assessment was carried out by two reviewers, working independently on an adapted five-domain risk of bias (RoB) checklist for laboratory studies. Results were synthesized qualitatively, as a meta-analysis was not possible due to limited number of studies and their RoB. A total of eight studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review after inclusion/exclusion criteria application. Out of these, two evaluated the effect of using NaOCl followed by an antioxidant, and the remaining six evaluated different enzymatic treatments (bromelain, chondroitinase ABC, papain, and trypsin). None of the studies reported a decrease of bond strength when a collagen-depletion strategy was used, in comparison to traditional hybrid layers (control). All enzymatic treatment studies which respected the inclusion criteria improved the bond strength to dentin. Some specific collagen-depletion strategies seem to play a favorable role in improving immediate bond strengths to dentin. Further research with sound methodology is required to consolidate these findings, since limitations in RoB and a low number of studies were found. The assessment of further proteolytic agents and long-term outcomes is also required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35906302/

This study aimed to assess the shear bond strength of a self-adhesive composite containing TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles for orthodontic bracket bonding.
This in vitro, experimental study was done on 70 extracted human premolars divided into 7 groups. Six groups of Vertise Flow self-adhesive composite samples were prepared: without any nanoparticles, with 0.5% and 1% TiO2 nanoparticles, 0.5% and 1% SiO2 nanoparticles, and 1% mixture of TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles so that nano-hybrid composites were prepared. Metal brackets were bonded with these samples as well as Transbond XT as the control group. The shear bond strength of the brackets to enamel was measured using a universal testing machine. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) score was also determined by a stereomicroscope. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, Tukey's test and Kruskal-Wallis test.
The shear bond strength of the groups was significantly different (p=0.000). Pairwise comparisons revealed that the bond strength of Transbond XT group was significantly higher than others (p<0.05), followed by the 1% TiO2 group with significant differences with Vertise Flow and 0.5% TiO2 groups. The lowest value belonged to Vertise Flow with no nanoparticles. The ARI scores was different in the control group (p=0.000).
Adding TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles to Vertise Flow self-adhesive composite not only did not adversely affect its shear bond strength, but also slightly increased it. Overall, the self-adhesive nano-hybrid composite containing TiO2 and/or SiO2 nanoparticles, following an additional etching step would be acceptable for bracket bonding and can be used clinically to benefit from the antimicrobial activity of these nanoparticles.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35851232/

The dentin specimens were conditioned by EDTA (Ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid) and divided into: (DBG) borate glass resin, (DRS) resin adhesive; (DDA) group had a dentin-desensitizing agent VivaSens (VivaDent, Liechtenstein) and (DC) control group. The treated enamel/dentin specimens had their SBS to composite. The enamel/dentin specimens were exposed to 1% citric acid (18 min). Enamel/dentin specimens were examined by (SEM/EDS) scanning-electron-microscope equipped with electron-dispersive-spectroscopy and (FTIR/ATR). Analysis-of-Variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the SBS and Wilcoxon-signed-rank test was used to compare the enamel/dentin areas protected by the applied agents before/after erosion (p = 0.05).
There was no significance difference in SBS among all groups except for (DDA) group that showed significant decrease p < 0.05. (EBG) and (DBG) groups were the only groups significantly protected enamel and dentin from erosion p < 0.05. FTIR/ATR showed that erosion altered the chemical structure of (DRS), (DDA), and (DC) groups but did not affect the other enamel/dentin groups. Degree of conversion of the borate-adhesive system was acceptable.
The Borate adhesive system released calcium and phosphate compounds that decreased the erosive activity of the citric acid resulting in protecting simulated dentin-hypersensitive areas and enamel from erosion without affecting the SBS to resin-composite.
A Borate adhesive system can be adopted as a therapeutic agent in a fully integrated program for protecting dentin-hypersensitive areas and in enamel next to orthodontic fixed appliances.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35781000/

Ninety-nine NCCLs were restored at 18 participants. NCCLs were divided into three different universal adhesive groups: Clearfil Universal Bond (CU) (n = 31), iBOND Universal (IU) (n = 33), and G-Premio Bond (GP) (n = 35). Prior to the adhesive procedures, selective enamel etching was performed with 37% phosphoric acid in all experimental groups. Adhesive systems were applied following the manufacturers' instructions, and the lesions were restored with a highly filled flowable resin composite (G-ænial Universal Flo). Restorations were finished and polished immediately after placement. All restorations were scored with regard to retention, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, sensitivity, surface texture, and color match using modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria after 1 week (baseline) and 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 60 months. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square and McNemar's and Kaplan Meier tests. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.
After 60 months, the recall rate was 72.2%. Survival rates of CU, IU, and GP restorations were 87%, 85.2%, and 96.5%, respectively. Five CU (25%), 8 IU (34.8%), and 12 GP (42.9%) restorations exhibit bravo scores for marginal adaptation. However, no differences were seen among them. CU showed lower bravo score than IU and GP for marginal discoloration (CU, 0%; IU, 26.1%; GP, 32.1%). Two CU, 7 IU, and 6 GP restorations showed bravo scores for surface texture, and 2 (9.1%) CU and 1 (3.3%) GP restorations were scored as bravo score for color match (p > 0.05).
The tested universal adhesives showed similar success rates during the 60-month follow-up. However, CU showed better clinical performance than IU and GP in terms of marginal adaptation and discoloration.

This study aimed to determine the effect of FI on the seal ability of self-etch adhesive in human dentin using dentin permeability test and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
The experiments were divided into 2 series: series 1 was performed on 28 extracted intact third molars and series 2 was performed on 28 extracted carious third molars (ICDAS 4 and 5). In each series, 20 teeth were used for dentin permeability test and 8 teeth were used for SEM study. For dentin permeability test, the specimens were divided into dentin without FI (control) and dentin with FI (experimental) subgroups. Hydraulic conductance (HD) of dentin was measured before and after adhesive treatment, and calculated for the percentage decrease of HD in each subgroup. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey test were used for statistical analysis. SEM study was used to assess the seal ability of self-etch adhesive and penetration of fluoride ions into dentinal tubules.
HD after self-etch adhesive treatment reduced by 57.75 ± 17.99% in intact dentin with FI, 46.60 ± 17.03% in intact dentin without FI, 45.00 ± 15.30% in caries affected dentin without FI, and 37.28 ± 14.72% in caries affected dentin with FI. There was no significant difference in percentage decrease of HD between dentin without FI and dentin with FI (P = 0.742); meanwhile, intact dentin with FI had significant greater percentage decrease than caries affected dentin with FI (P < 0.05). SEM findings showed FI produced more particle formation and deeper precipitation in intact dentin than those in caries affected dentin.
FI did not affect the seal ability of self-etch adhesive in human dentin when compared to without FI. However, FI could augment the seal ability of the self-etch adhesive in intact dentin better than that in caries affected dentin.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35366856/

Considering that practitioners still misdiagnose teeth affected by MIH, there is an urge for more knowledge about this topic in order to propose a more adequate and conservative treatment. The purpose of this study was to report the clinical challenges regarding the restorative management of a patient with MIH. A 13-year-old girl sought dental treatment, complaining about hypersensitivity in posterior teeth. Under clinical exams, notable enamel alterations mainly affecting posterior teeth (including molars) presented particular characteristics frequently attributed to MIH, and visible stains on maxillary central incisors were present. Because the mineral and organic content of MIH-affected enamel differ from sound enamel, it may imply special care for bonding of a restorative material. Thus, in order to promote a minimally invasive approach, selective removal of carious tissue and restoration with microhybrid composite resin was conducted after application of a universal bonding system used as self-etching strategy.

Shear bond strength of two resin composite cements (an adhesive cement: Panavia V5 [PV5] and a self-adhesive cement: RelyX Universal [RUV]) to human enamel, dentin, and a variety of restorative materials (microfilled composite, composite, polymer-infiltrated ceramic, feldspar ceramic, lithium disilicate and zirconia) was measured. Thermocycle aging was performed with selected material combinations.
For both cements, the highest shear bond strength to dentin was achieved when using a primer (PV5: 18.0 ± 4.2 MPa, RUV: 18.2 ± 3.3 MPa). Additional etching of dentin reduced bond strength for RUV (12.5 ± 4.9 MPa). On enamel, PV5 achieved the highest bond strength when the primer was used (18.0 ± 3.1 MPa), while for RUV etching of enamel and priming provided best results (21.2 ± 6.6 MPa). Shear bond strength of RUV to restorative materials was superior to PV5. Bonding to resin-based materials was predominantly observed for RUV.
While use of RUV with the selective-etch technique is slightly more labor intensive than PV5, RUV (with its universal primer) displayed a high-bonding potential to all tested restorative materials, especially to resin.
For a strong adhesion to the tooth substrate, PV5 (with its tooth primer) is to be preferred because etching with phosphoric acid is not required.

There was no significant difference in bond strength with Clearfil SE Bond and Clearfil tri-S Bond between the cavity wall and cavity floor (p > 0.05).
The findings suggested that the strength of bonding to the cavity floor and cavity wall was affected by C-factor regardless of the adhesive system. Bonding to flat wall was higher than flat floor regardless of the adhesive system. Self-etching system provided uniform bond to the cavity wall and cavity floor dentin.

Fifty human molars with dentine carious lesions were excavated selectively using Carisolv
At T0 there was no difference in bond strength between the tested materials (p>0.05). At T1, EXP-SE and EXP-ER were the only materials to show no significant reduction in bond strength (p<0.05). The SEM showed a clear presence of minerals deposited on the dentine surface after bonding in the EXP-SE and EXP-ER groups. The specimens restored with RMGIC showed no exposure of the dentine surface after failure. The OPT and UA-SE specimens showed clear signs of degradation at the interface. Confocal microscopy imaged mineral precipitation at the interface of the EXP groups.
Conventional adhesives may have inadequate bonding performance with evident degradation at the dentine-bonded interface over time. Although the RMGIC may present a drop in bond strength after prolonged storage, the bonding interface may result less affected by degradation over time. Innovative ion-releasing adhesives may remineralise the caries-affected dentine and achieve a stable bond over time.

Sixty-four sound human molars were collected and randomly allocated in 4 main experimental groups (n = 16) according to the adhesive system employed and subsequently divided into two subgroups depending on their application mode SE or ER (n = 8): ZipBond X (ZBX-SE; ZBX-ER), Prime and Bond Active (PBA-SE; PBA-ER), Clearfil Universal Bond Quick (CBQ-SE; CBQ-ER) or Scotchbond Universal (SCH-SE; SCH-ER). The specimens were cut into sticks with a cross-sectional area of approximately 0.9 mm
ZBX, PBA and SCH exhibited greater μTBS values than CQB at 24 h in both SE and ER modes (p < 0.05). CQB showed a significant decrease in μTBS values after ageing both when used in SE and ER mode (p < 0.05). ZBX-ER exhibited no significant differences in the μTBS test after ageing (p > 0.05), while a significant drop in μTBS was seen in SCH-ER and APB-ER after 10-month ageing (p < 0.05). Clear signs of degradation were evident in the resin-dentine interface created with CQB regardless of the application mode or the ageing time. In APB-ER and SCH-ER groups, such signs of degradation were evident after ageing in AS. ZBX showed slight dye infiltration both when used in ER and SE mode.
The long-term bonding performance of modern universal adhesives is usually influenced by the adhesive strategy employed; self-etching application should be prioritised during dentine bonding. Moreover, the use of shortened bonding protocols may compromise the quality of the resin-dentine interface and the bonding performance of most modern universal adhesives.
The use of etch-and-rinse bonding procedures, as well as ""shortened"" application protocols should be eluded when using modern universal adhesives in dentine. However, new generation universal adhesives based on innovative chemical formulations may probably allow clinicians to achieve long-term bonding performance with such simplified system also when employed in ER mode.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35149904/

One conventional cement (Panavia V5) served as a control. After preparation, the samples were subjected to thermocycling as a method of artificial aging of dental materials applied to simulate long-term use in oral conditions. Shear bond strength was evaluated according to PN-EN ISO 29022:2013-10 and failure modes were observed under a light microscope. Statistical analysis was performed. The study demonstrated that a combination of ceramics and cements directly impacts the bond strength. The highest bond strength was observed in Panavia V5, lower in Panavia SA and Maxcem Elite and the lowest-in RelyX U200.

Seventy extracted human maxillary central incisors were scanned and reconstructed into three-dimensional models. The extracted teeth were then embedded and randomly divided into seven groups (n = 10 per group). Based on digital analyses of the three-dimensional models, guided tooth preparation and bonding procedures were performed individually to form seven different percentages (100%, 80%, 60% 50%, 40%, 20% and 0%) of remaining enamel thickness on the bonding surface. Finally, the SBS test was performed, and the data were statistically analysed by one-way ANOVA with LSD post hoc test (α = 0.05).
The complete enamel surface exhibited the highest SBS (19.93 ± 4.55 MPa), followed by 80% enamel (19.03 ± 3.66 MPa), 60% enamel (18.44 ± 3.65 MPa), 50% enamel (18.18 ± 3.41 MPa), 40% enamel (17.83 ± 3.01 MPa) and 20% enamel (11.32 ± 3.42 MPa) group. The lowest SBS (9.63 ± 3.46 MPa) was detected in 0% enamel group. No significant difference was observed among the 40-100% enamel groups, while the 20% or 0% enamel group demonstrated a significantly lower mean SBS than the 40% enamel group (p < 0.05).
The SBS value of CLVs bonded to 100% enamel on the finishing surfaces (nearly 20 MPa) was twice that which bonded to 0% enamel (nearly 10 MPa). Bonding to 100% enamel is the most reliable treatment. When dentin exposure is inevitable, enamel should be preserved as much as possible to maintain good bonding.

Saliva was applied at different stages in the bonding process, and was investigated to be remedied by water rinsing and/or air drying. Uncontaminated tooth surfaces were used as controls. Bonding procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and a polymer-based composite was placed. The bond strength was measured by a micro-tensile test. Except for the etch-and-rinse approach having contamination with saliva after etching, followed by air drying, all salivary contamination regimens resulted in a substantial number of specimens not surviving the test, and the bond strength value of these was therefore set to 0 MPa for the purposes of the statistical analysis. Water rinsing after etching and salivary contamination did significantly reduce the bond strength. Contamination after priming showed the lowest bond strength. For the self-etch approach, saliva contamination before the adhesive procedure, followed by air drying, significantly reduced the bond strength, while contamination followed by water rinsing or air drying did not statistically significantly reduce the strength.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935213/

Class I and class II resin composite restorations (n = 220) at least 3 mm deep were inserted in 55 subjects. The universal adhesive was applied using the SE (self-etch strategy on dentin with selective enamel etching) or the ER strategy, with or without prior application of a glutaraldehyde-based desensitizer (Gluma Desensitizer - GL) to form groups SEGL and ERGL. A bulk-fill resin composite (Tetric NCeram Bulk Fill) was used for all restorations. Spontaneous POS was assessed 7 days after the restorative procedure using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). After 7, 14, and 30 days of completing each restoration, the subjects were reassessed to evaluate POS caused by stimulation with an air blast, horizontal and vertical percussion. In addition, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, fracture, and recurrence of caries were evaluated using the FDI (World Dental Federation) criteria after 7 days and at 12 months.

Fifteen orthodontic patients were selected for the study. For each patient, the teeth were rinsed and dried, and brackets were bonded with composite (Transbond XT) and RMGIC (Vitremer Core Buildup/Restorative). At the conclusion of orthodontic treatment, their brackets were removed. Dental replicas were made of epoxy resin in initial conditions (before bonded) and after polishing with an aluminum oxide disc system. Adhesive remnant index (ARI) and surface roughness was measured on the dental replicas and data were evaluated statistically by Mann-Whitney and paired t-test, respectively. No bracket debonding occurred during patients' treatment periods. It was verified that the ARI values of the two maxillary central incisors were similar (p = 0.665). For both bonding materials, the ARI value of 3 was predominant. After polishing, surface roughness was similar in the composite and RMGIC groups (0.245 μm and 0.248 μm, respectively; p = 0.07). In both groups, enamel surface roughness values were significantly lower after polishing compared with the initial condition (p < 0.001). RMGIC promoted efficiency in cementing brackets without fail during treatment; the choice of composite or RMGIC materials was not a factor that influenced the roughness of the enamel surface, however, polishing led to smoother surfaces than those found at the beginning of the treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877976/

A 'tug-of-war' direct encounter design was employed to compare the enamel bond strengths of two universal adhesives and their different application modes simultaneously under the same tensile load applied to double-sided bonded specimens. Clearfil Universal Bond (CU; Kuraray, Kurashiki, Japan) and Scotchbond Universal Adhesive (SB; 3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) were applied in self-etch (S) and etch-and-rinse (E) mode on 110 human molar samples to perform two experiments. Experiment 1 compared the enamel bond strengths of the combinations of adhesive application modes utilising µTBST. The data were analysed using a Welch analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a Games-Howell test. Experiment 2 employed DµTBST to determine the suitability of the new double-sided bonded assembly and ascertain which of the adhesive application mode combinations was superior. The data were analysed using a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, followed by pairwise comparisons with a Mantel-Cox log-rank test. The level of significance was set at P ˂ 0.05.
The µTBST results did not show significant differences for CUE vs CUS, SBE vs SBS, CUS vs SBS and CUS vs SBE (P ˃ 0.05); however, from DµTBST, the survival distributions for the interventions were statistically significantly different (χ2(3) = 145.130, P ˂ 0.0005), indicating the superiority of universal adhesive CU over SB and application mode E over S with certainty.
DµTBST was able to add more discerning outcomes to the µTBST results, indicating that the new technique could become a valuable adjunct to the conventional method.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34491010/

Conventional etching (CE) or SE was applied prior to pit and fissure sealants bonding. Enamel conditioned surfaces were evaluated by SEM at × 500, × 1000, and × 2000 magnification to determine etching patterns. Subsequently, 25 PFS blocks (3 × 2 × 1.5 mm) p/g were bonded to enamel surface. Samples were stored in water at 37 °C for 24 h, previous to SBS and ARI test. One-way ANOVA and Tamhane statistic tests were used for SBS; while Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis were employed for ARI (p ≤ 0.05).

Significant differences in SBS and ARI assessments were found. All experimental groups showed type 1 etching pattern.
The etching pattern was less pronounced in self-etching groups, which showed an equal or superior in vitro performance compared to conventional etching agents. The clinical use of self-etching agents could be recommended before pit and fissure sealants application in new dental protocols.

Six bonded teeth per group were sectioned into sticks for µTBS testing. Statistical analyses were performed using 3-way ANOVA followed by Duncan's test (p < 0.05). Additional teeth were prepared to observe the interaction between the dentin smear layer obtained from each bur with adhesives under different application modes using ﻿transmission electron microscop﻿y (TEM).
Active application significantly increased the dentin bond strength of SE2, irrespective of the kind of bur used (p < 0.05). The highest bond strength of SBU was observed when bonded to superfine-grit diamond bur-cut dentin with the active application. There was, however, no influence of the tested factors on GPB group (p > 0.05). TEM observation showed that active application promoted dentin smear layer dissolution in all adhesive groups.
Bond strengths of self-etching adhesives to dentin are influenced by bur-cut smear layers and mainly by application mode of adhesive materials.

The characteristic 54.7° sidewall etch angle obtained via KOH etching of (100) orientation silicon wafers has been used to create a novel microneedle design. The KOH simultaneously etches both the front and back sides of the wafer to produce V shaped grooves, that intersect to form a sharp pyramidal six-sided microneedle tip. This method allows fabrication of solid microneedles with different geometries to determine the optimal microneedle length and width for effective penetration and minimally invasive drug delivery. A modified grooved microneedle design can also be used to create a hollow microneedle, via bonding of two grooved microneedles together, creating an enclosed hollow channel. The microneedle arrays developed, effectively penetrate the skin without significant indentation, thereby enabling effective delivery of active ingredients via either a poke and patch application using solid microneedles or direct injection using hollow microneedles. This simple, scalable and cost effective method utilises KOH to etch the silicon wafer in-plane, allowing microneedles with variable length of several mm to be fabricated, as opposed to out-of-plane MNs, which are geometrically restricted to dimensions less than the thickness of the wafer.

Ninety caries-free human third molars were divided into three surface groups: enamel, dentin, and NaOCl-treated dentin. (n = 30/group) Each group was divided into three subgroups (n = 10/group) of luting resin materials with etch-and-rinse; self-etch and self-adhesive systems. Resin composite blocks and sticks were fabricated and adhered onto dentin and enamel surfaces. The bond strength values were evaluated with micro shear test and statistical analysis were made. On the other hand, teeth were sectioned with a slow-speed saw into multiple beams. After thermocycling, samples were kept in 50% silver nitrate solution. Samples were analyzed with SEM in back-scattered mode. According to the micro-shear bond tests, higher bond strength values were observed in etch-and-rinse system. Bond strength values in self-adhesive and etch-and-rinse groups were significantly higher than self-etch groups in dentin surface and dentin surface treatment with NaOCl. Back-scattered scanning electron microscope results showed that, different degradation mechanism was observed. The present study indicates that, due to the acid etching in dentin, collagen biodegradation was observed within the hybrid layer. On the enamel surfaces, resin degradation was related with resin monomers in adhesive systems.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33931911/
33847469,Effect of different surface treatment on the repair bond strength of feldspathic porcelain.,Dental and medical problems,2021,"Valian A, Salehi EM, Mahmoudzadeh M, Dabagh NK","Considering the use of silane-containing universal adhesives to enhance the repair bond strength of porcelain restorations, a question arises whether the application of these adhesives eliminates the need for a separate application of silane or not.
This study aimed to assess the effect of various kinds of surface treatment, including hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching, the application of bis-silane and the use of universal adhesives, on the repair bond strength of feldspathic porcelain.
In this experimental in vitro study, 70 porcelain disks were fabricated and divided into 7 groups (n = 10) for the following types of surface treatment: C (control group) – HF etching + silane + Porcelain Bond; HSB – HF etching + Single Bond; HSSB – HF etching + silane + Single Bond; HAB – HF etching + All Bond; HSAB – HF etching + silane + All Bond; HFB – HF etching + FuturaBond®; and HSFB – HF etching + silane + FuturaBond. After applying different kinds of surface treatment, the specimens were light-cured and the Filtek® Z250 composite was bonded to the treated surfaces. The specimens were incubated in distilled water at 37°C for 24 h, and then underwent 5,000 thermal cycles. The repair bond strength of porcelain was measured and the mode of failure was determined under a stereomicroscope. Data was analyzed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s test.
Differences between the groups in the porcelain repair bond strength were significant (p < 0.0001). Bond strength for Single Bond (p < 0.001) and All Bond (p < 0.001) along with silane was significantly higher than for the application of these adhesives without a separate silane application step. This difference was not significant for FuturaBond. Mixed failure was the dominant mode of failure in all groups.
The application of silane, irrespective of the use of universal adhesives with or without silane, increased the porcelain repair bond strength. Thus, a separate silane application step following HF etching and the use of universal adhesives with or without silane can enhance the repair bond strength of feldspathic porcelain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33847469/

The buccal right and left halves of 27 extracted human teeth were randomly allocated to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or micro-computed tomography (μCT) for evaluation. The buccal surfaces were pumiced, etched with 37% phosphoric acid gel etchant for 15 seconds, rinsed, and air dried. Each tooth was divided into three regions (incisal, middle, and cervical) and viewed after etching at 1200× magnification with SEM. The μCT scans were taken before and after etching to calculate apparent and material mineral densities.
SEM showed greater aprismatic enamel and poorer etch quality (ie, significantly less percentage enamel) for the posterior than anterior teeth and for the cervical region than for the incisal and middle regions of all teeth. Although there were no density differences prior to etching, μCT demonstrated that etching increased material density significantly more for the anterior than posterior teeth. Prior to etching, the enamel in the cervical regions was significantly less dense than the enamel in the middle or incisal regions. Etching significantly increased the material density of all three regions, which decreased initial regional differences. After etching, the apparent density of the cervical region remained significantly lower than the densities of the other two regions.
Based on SEM and μCT, there is greater aprismatic enamel and inferior etch quality in the cervical regions of all tooth types and is clinically significant in explaining the failure of sealant retention and the propensity for white spot lesions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33760026/

Forty posterior human extracted teeth were used. After mesiodistal sectioning of the teeth crowns, the samples were randomly divided into two groups-in the first group (E), bonding was performed on the enamel after roughening and in the second group (D), the enamel was removed and bonding was performed on the dentin. These groups were further randomly divided into two subgroups according to the type of etching (n = 20 each). In the acid-etched groups (EA and DA), the surfaces were etched with 37% phosphoric acid. In the laser-conditioned groups (EL and DL), the surfaces were conditioned with Er,Cr:YSGG laser. Total-etch adhesive system was used to bond all the 80 specimens resin composite. The composite was vertically light-cured, and the specimens were subjected to a shear bond strength test. Modes of bond failure were determined with a stereomicroscope.
The highest shear bond strength was observed for the DA group (16.25 ± 1.10 MPa, p < 0.0001), whereas the lowest was observed for the DL group (8.56 ± 0.67 MPa). The adhesive failure mode was the most frequently observed in all groups.

33601300,Effect of myricetin on odontoblast-like cells and its potential to preserve resin-dentin Bonds.,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2021,"Baldion PA, Cortes CC, Castellanos JE, Betancourt DE","Stabilization of the resin-dentin interface to increase the durability of adhesive dental restorations is a challenging task. The use of naturally occurring collagen crosslinking agents has been proposed to prevent degradation of the hybrid layer. Myricetin (MYR) is a flavonoid with a wide variety of beneficial effects and it has been used for the treatment of different systemic pathologies. The chemical structure of MYR makes it a powerful antioxidant, an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, and a collagen cross-linker. This study presents MYR as a novel treatment in operative dentistry to stabilize the resin-dentin interface by inhibiting MMPs and crosslinking the collagen. Viability tests carried out using a resazurin assay showed that MYR had no cytotoxic effects on human odontoblast-like cells and the phenotype was preserved. Fluorometric MMP activity assay and fluorescence microscopy revealed that the MMPs in the demineralized dentin were effectively inhibited by the application of MYR (600 μM for 120 s). A microtensile bond strength test was performed immediately and after six months of storage. The bond strength to dentin was not affected by MYR and was preserved over time. Demineralized dentin beams were evaluated to determine the dentin biomodification using microtensile strength and elastic modulus assays. MYR improved the biomechanical behavior of the demineralized dentin similarly to glutaraldehyde, a recognized crosslinking agent. These findings indicated that MYR acts as an MMP inhibitor, collagen cross-linker, and preserver of the bond strength. Furthermore, MYR is an ethanol-soluble molecule with a lower molecular weight than the other polyphenols; hence, it can be applied for a short time and diffuses deeply through the dentin without any associated cytotoxicity. This molecule has beneficial effects on the biological and mechanical behavior of the resin-dentin interface and may be used to effectively stabilize the hybrid layer in a clinical setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33601300/

Plaque accumulation around the bracket plays a critical role and could cause various degrees of white spot lesions (WSLs) on the surface of teeth. The 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) polymer is a biological polymer with protein repellent and an anti-bacterial adhesion effects. In this study, the enamel shear bond strength (SBS) and protein repellent property in vitro of self-etching orthodontic adhesive with MPC were evaluated. It was found that the self-etching adhesive with 0-7.5%MPC met the orthodontic clinical requirement on the SBS values at three different points of time. The incorporation of 7.5%MPC significantly reduced the bacterial adhesion and total microorganism of the yield biofilm. Moreover, the MTT assay showed that the amount of plaque metabolism in 7.5%MPC was the lowest among the groups. To conclude, the novel protein repellent self-etching adhesive was able to inhibit biofilm formation efficiently and minimize enamel demineralization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33518689/

Samples of sound and artificial caries-affected human dentin were treated or not with 38% SDF and restored with an etch-and-rinse or a self-etch bonding system. For the cleaning part, water, aluminum oxide, and pumice paste were used after SDF application to determine whether SDF affected the bond strength to dentin. Fracture mode was evaluated under scanning electron microscope. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA.
SDF application resulted in the lowest MBS for the self-etching adhesive system on caries-affected dentin (P< 0.05). Cleaning with pumice slurry maintained the MBS in SDF groups when compared to the control groups (not treated with SDF). Fracture evaluation showed more adhesive failures on adhesive systems groups. EDX analysis showed no silver particles when pumice paste was used for cleaning.

The mean SBSs in MPa for the four groups were respectively: A: 9.640 (±3.69), B: 10.261 (±3.03), C: 9.689 (±2.48), D: 8.412 (±3.02). No statistically significant differences were neither found through one-way ANOVA to exist between the group means (P: 0.715), nor for the ARI score frequence through Chi
1. SBSs of all adhesives and ARI score distributions did not present any significant differences when used to bond stainless steel molar tubes. 2. All adhesives presented with acceptable shear bond strengths for clinical use. 3. Maxcem Elite under the tested conditions presented the greatest and G-Premio the least number of enamel fractures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33246877/
33200282,Is it possible for a simultaneous biomodification during acid etching on naturally caries-affected dentin bonding?,Clinical oral investigations,2021,"Hass V, da Maceno Oliveira TB, Cardenas AFM, de Siqueira FSF, Bauer JR, Abuna G, Sinhoreti MAC, de Souza JJ, Loguercio AD","This study investigated the ability of modified phosphoric acids containing chlorhexidine (CHX) or grape seed extract (GSE) for promoting simultaneous biomodification during acid etching on bonding properties in caries-affected dentin (CAD).
Thirty-two human molars (8 with sound dentin [SD] and 24 naturally CAD) were selected for the study. The SD and CAD were initially exposed, then randomized and etched according to the following groups: (1) SD (SD-CT) and CAD (CAD-CT) both with 37% phosphoric acid, (2) CAD with 2% CHX containing 37% phosphoric acid (CAD-CHX), and (3) CAD with 2% GSE containing 10% phosphoric acid (CAD-GSE). The bonding procedure and composite build-ups were performed after acid etching. Subsequently, they were sectioned in resin-dentin specimens. The specimens were submitted for chemical profiling by micro-Raman, microtensile bond strength (μTBS), failure mode with chemical characterization by FEG/SEM-EDX, and in situ zymography by CLSM. The data from μTBS and CLSM were statistically analyzed (1-way ANOVA and Tukey's test; α = 0.05).
The highest μTBS results were shown for SD-CT in comparison with all CAD groups (p < 0.001), and the lowest for CAD-CT and CAD-CHX (p < 0.001). The etching with CHX did not increase the μTBS for CAD when compared with CT (p = 0.52). However, the etching with GSE improved significantly the μTBS for CAD when compared with CT and CHX (p < 0.001). The chemical profile detected chemical and structural changes in collagen peaks for CAD-CT, which were not detected when the CAD was etched by modified acids. Also, the poorest hybridization ability was detected in CAD for CT, which was significantly improved with modified acids, especially the GSE, as evaluated by chemical profile and failure mode. A significant reduction of MMP activity on CAD was promoted by modified acids in comparison with CT (both p < 0.001).
The GSE-containing acid was able to promote biomodification during the acid etching, increasing the bonding properties and reducing the activity of the MMPs within the hybrid layer.
The use of GSE-containing phosphoric acid can be a promising alternative to improve the bonding performance on caries-affected dentin, since it is capable of biomodifying the dentin during the acid etching, without adding any extra step in bonding procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33200282/

The purpose of this study was to evaluate enamel surface roughness and to observe the enamel-adhesive interface after acid-base challenge using three different self-adhesive resin cements combined with universal adhesives.
Three self-adhesive resin cements: PANAVIA SA Luting Cement Plus (SA), Calibra Universal (CA) and MaxCem Elite Chroma (MC) which in conjunction with the particular universal adhesives: Clearfil Universal Bond Quick (UQ), Prime&Bond Universal (PB) and Optibond Universal (OB) were tested. Thirty enamel surfaces from caries-free human premolars were ground and bonded with the tested self-adhesive resin cements combined with universal adhesives. The surface roughness test (Sa) with or without applying adhesives was performed with 3D-CLSM. The interface of the bonded specimens after acid-base challenge was also examined by SEM.
The Sa of OB was significantly higher than those of PB and UQ. There were statistically significant differences among all of the groups (p < 0.05). An acid-base resistant zone (ABRZ) was observed in all groups, however, formation of the ABRZ was material dependent.
OB provided most etching performance to enamel of human premolars and MC group with OB presented durability against acid-base challenge.

Dentin specimens were prepared using freshly extracted intact primary molars and divided randomly into four groups based on the surface treatment applied. The control and etchant groups received no treatment and conventional acid etching treatment, respectively, while the energy and frequency groups received laser surface treatment with variable energy (50-300 mJ) and frequency (5-30 Hz) parameters. The morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy. The surface-treated dentin slices were bonded to resin tablets, followed by thermocycle treatment. The shear strength was determined using a universal testing machine and de-bonded surfaces were observed using a stereomicroscope.
SEM observation showed that the surface morphology of the dentin slices changed after etching as well as after Er:YAG laser pre-treatment with different energy and frequency values. The dentin tubules opened within a specific energy (50-200 mJ) and frequency (5-20 Hz) range. Beyond this range, the intertubular dentin showed cracks and structural disintegration. Shear strength tests showed no significant changes after acid etching. The shear strength increased significantly (P < 0.05) after Er:YAG laser pre-treatment compared with that of the control group. The shear strength increased within the same energy (50-200 mJ) and frequency (5-20 Hz) range as the tubule opening, but not significantly (P > 0.05). The most common mode of interface failure was adhesive (interface) failure, followed by mixed and resin cohesive failure.
Pre-treatment using Er:YAG laser opens the dentinal tubules without the formation of a smear layer and improves the bonding strength between the primary teeth dentin and the resin composites.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33172456/

Objectives: The objective of this multicenter, double-blind, split-mouth randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the clinical performance of a new dual-cure universal adhesive system (Futurabond U, Voco GmBH) when applied using different strategies over a period of 18 months.Methods and Materials: Fifty patients participated in this study. Two hundred non-carious cervical lesions were restored using the adhesive Futurabond U according to four adhesive strategies (n=50 per group): only self-etch (SEE), selective enamel etching + self-etch (SET), etch-and-rinse with dry dentin (ERDry), and etch-and-rinse with wet dentin (ERWet). After the adhesive application, cavities were restored using Admira Fusion composite resin. These restorations were evaluated according to FDI World Dental Federation criteria for the following characteristics: retention/fracture, marginal adaptation, marginal staining, postoperative sensitivity, and caries recurrence.Results: After 18 months, only four patients (12 months: one patient, n=4 restorations; and 18 months: three patients, n=12 restorations) were not evaluated. Fourteen restorations were lost after 18 months of clinical evaluation (four for SEE, three for SET, three for ERDry, and four for ERWet). The retention rates for 18 months (95% confidence interval) were 92% (81%-97%) for SEE, 94% (83%-97%) for SET, 94% (83%-97%) for ERDry, and 92% (81%-97%) for ERWet (p>0.05). Thirty-eight restorations were considered to have minor discrepancies in marginal adaptation at the 18-month recall (13 for SEE, 13 for SET, six for ERDry, and six for ERWet; p>0.05). Fourteen restorations were detected as a minor marginal discoloration at the 18-month recall (six for SEE, six for SET, one for ERDry, and one for ERWet; p>0.05). However, all were considered clinically acceptable. No restorations showed postoperative sensitivity or caries recurrence at the time.Conclusion: The clinical performance of the Futurabond U did not depend on the bonding strategy used, and it was considered reliable after 18 months of clinical evaluation, although more marginal discrepancy was observed in the self-etch group.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33170938/

The study included 156 human third molars in 16 subgroups (2×4×2) under two main groups (sealant type): Group A- hydrophobic resin sealant, 3M Clinpro™ Sealant; Group B- hydrophilic resin sealant, Ultraseal XT Hydro. Each group was then divided according to the type of surface conditioning; 1- Er,Cr:YSSG laser etching, 2- acid-etching, 3- acid-etching+etch-and-rinse adhesive (Prime&Bond® One Select) and 4- self-etching adhesive (Clearfil™ SE Bond). After contaminating the conditioned occlusal enamel surfaces with artificial saliva, fissure sealant was applied in half of the specimens (a), whereas in the other half, (b) the respective surface conditioning was repeated and then fissure sealant was placed. Following thermocycling, the samples were immersed in basic fuchsin, sectioned, and dye penetration was quantitatively assessed with ImageJ. Two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc tests were used for statistical analyses (p<0.05).
The least microleakage was observed in A3b and A3a, whereas B4b and B4a were the subgroups with the highest microleakage. Following saliva contamination, when surface conditioning was not re-applied, the effects of fissure sealant types and surface conditioning were significant (p=0.005 and p<0.001, respectively). However, their interaction was insignificant (p=0.173). When surface conditioning was re-applied after saliva contamination, the effects of type of fissure sealant and surface conditioning (p=0.000, for both) and their interaction (p=0.004) were significant.
3M Clinpro™ Sealant was superior to Ultraseal XT Hydro. Re-application of Er,Cr:YSSG laser and the self-etching adhesive did not affect the microleakage of both fissure sealants. Without re-application, acid-etching+etch-and-rinse adhesive was superior to acid-etching only. However, both of them were similarly successful when they were re-applied following saliva contamination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33167017/

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, relevant articles published until the end of October 2019 were retrieved from PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The inclusion criteria were in vitro studies on the effect of laser on SBS of metal brackets to the enamel in comparison with acid-etching, and studies published in English to the end of October 2019. After assessing the eligibility criteria and quality, a total of 18 studies were statistically analysed using STATA software.
The SBS of 554 human tooth specimens in the test group (subjected to irradiation of different laser types) was compared with the SBS of 313 tooth specimens in the control group (etched with phosphoric acid). The meta-analysis showed that laser etching decreased the SBS of brackets by 1.39MPa, compared with phosphoric acid etching, and this reduction was statistically significant (P<0.05). The Er:YAG group, however, showed 0.6MPa higher SBS than phosphoric acid etching group, but this increase was not statistically significant.
Laser etching yields lower SBS than acid etching; even though different laser types have different effects on SBS. Thus, the conventional acid-etching technique is still recommended for enamel etching prior to the bonding of orthodontic metal brackets.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33144060/

Lingual surfaces of 30 human teeth were sandblasted with 2 different distances: 1, 2mm and 3 different durations: 1, 2, 3s and photographed using a light microscope. The cavity depth and diameter of the sandblasted teeth were measured on the light microscope's pictures. A pilot study was performed to minimize possible combinations of sandblasting durations and distances. To validate the measurement method, sandblasted teeth were ground cut for comparison. Inter-examiner reliability was assessed with Bland-Altman analysis. Mann-Whitney U-test was used to detect cavity and diameter changes for every sandblasting duration and NTD combination.
From the pilot study sandblasting durations 1,2 and 3s and NTD<2mm were chosen. The cavity diameter of the sandblasted area did not change with increased sandblasting duration nor NTD (P>0.05). The cavity depth of the sandblasted area increased statistically with an increased sandblasting duration (P<0.05) but did not increase with an increase NTD (P>0.05). The 95% limits of inter-examiner agreement were narrow.
All distance and duration combinations tested caused enamel damage. Sandblasting duration had greater impact on the cavity depth than the NTD. The blasting duration should, therefore, not exceed 2s and the NTD should be held at maximum 2mm to minimize the risk of unintentional spread.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33093007/

The present study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the microleakage of cavities prepared by Er,Cr:YSGG lasers with that by traditional burs. In addition, the effect of acid etching on the adhesive potential of self-etch and etch-and-rinse adhesives was assessed after laser preparation.

Superficial occlusal dentin surfaces obtained from sectioned third molars were ground with SiC paper (600-grit; 1 minute; N-normal dentin) or subsequently submitted to an initial erosive challenge (Coca-Cola; 5 minutes). They then received one of the following treatments: application of a placebo (P), a 0.12% CHX digluconate, an EGCG at 400 μM, or a 10% PAC gel (vehicle: hydroxyethylcellulose, propylene glycol, methylparaben, imidazolidinyl urea, and deionized water; active principle: as per the experimental groups when applicable) or no treatment (C: control). Initially demineralized dentin was also submitted to pH cycling (Coca-Cola; 5 minutes, 3×/day, 5 days) to simulate eroded dentin (E).

For that, this study assessed the resin-dentin bond strength and the in situ gelatinolytic activity profile at the adhesive interface at initial and after 6 month of storage. One hundred and two sound human third molars were prepared and randomly divided into 3 groups according to the adhesive strategy: SB (two-step etch-and-rinse adhesive, Adper Single Bond 2, 10-MDP-free control group); SU-ER (Adper Single Bond Universal, 10-MDP containing universal adhesive applied on etch-and-rinse mode); and SU-SE (SU applied on self-etching mode).

As bracket rebonding is associated with reduced shear bond strength, the aim of the present investigation is to analyse the effect of different innovative rebonding systems to identify optimised rebonding protocols for orthodontic patient care.
Metallic brackets were bonded to the frontal enamel surfaces of 240 bovine lower incisors embedded in resin bases. Teeth were randomly divided into two major experimental groups: in group 1 a hydrophilic primer (Assure™ PLUS) was compared to commonly used orthodontic adhesives (Transbond XT™, BrackFix®, Grengloo™) and a zero control. In group 2 different rebonding systems were analysed using a hydrophilic primer (Assure™ PLUS), a methyl methacrylate-consisting primer (Plastic Conditioner) and a conventional adhesive (Transbond XT™). All teeth were tested for shear bond strength according to the DIN-13990 standard, the Adhesive Remnant Index and enamel fracture rate.
The hydrophilic primer enhanced shear bond strength at first bonding (Assure™ PLUS 20.29 ± 4.95 MPa vs. Transbond XT™ 18.45 ± 2.57 MPa; BrackFix® 17 ± 5.2 MPa; Grengloo™ 19.08 ± 3.19 MPa; Meron 8.7 ± 3.9 MPa) and second bonding (Assure™ PLUS 16.76 ± 3.71 MPa vs. Transbond XT™ 13.06 ± 3.19 MPa). Using Plastic Conditioner did not seem to improve shear bond strength at rebonding (13.57 ± 2.94). When enamel etching was left out, required shear bond strength could not be achieved (Plastic Conditioner + Assure™ PLUS 8.12 ± 3.34 MPa; Plastic Conditioner: 3.7 ± 1.95 MPa). Hydrophilic priming systems showed decreased ARI-scores (second bonding: 2.63) and increased enamel fracture rates (first bonding: 55%; second bonding 21,05%).

Surfaces of polished enamel were etched with phosphoric acid and then subdivided into two regions. Bracket bonding resin was thinly applied to one region. After 24-hr immersion in artificial saliva, the bonding resin on the enamel surfaces was removed by grinding with tungsten carbide bur at low-speed, followed by polishing with one of four different polishing systems: (a) nonfluoridated paste (NF); (b) fluoridated paste (F); (c) S-PRG filler-containing paste (S-PRG); or (d) nonfluoridated plus S-PRG filler-containing paste (NF + S-PRG) (n = 15).

Representative specimens were examined with scanning electron microscope. In all specimens, the mechanical properties of the enamel surfaces were markedly degraded by acid etching. However, the mechanical properties of both regions (etched and resin-infiltrated enamels) showed recovery after polishing and 7-day immersion. Polishing with NF + S-PRG paste led to significant recovery of mechanical properties compared to polishing with NF or S-PRG paste alone, and remineralization was equivalent to that seen with F paste. Porous etched enamel surfaces were filled with a remineralization layer after each polishing procedure and 7-day immersion in all polishing groups.

The bond strength was evaluated using a shear strength test according to the PN-EN ISO 29022:2013-10. Evaluation of the differences was performed using the Statistica software. Failure modes were analyzed using a light microscope.
All the studied cements differed (regardless of the ceramic type) in the bond strength. The highest bond strength was observed in Panavia V5, lower - in RelyX U200 and Panavia SA, and the lowest - in Maxcem. For IPS e.max ZirCAD, it was observed that compared to Panavia V5, the other cements were characterized by a significantly higher bond strength. For the IPS Empress CAD and the IPS e.max CAD, Panavia V5 displayed the highest bond strength. For all the studied self-adhesive cements, the failure of adhesion between the cement and dentin was predominant mode.
Significant differences were found in the shear bond strengths of the CAD/CAM ceramics luted to dentin using tested self-adhesive and conventional cements. The bond strength depended on the combination of ceramic and cement. The IPS e.max ZirCAD had the highest bond strength to dentin after cementation with RelyX U200, while the IPS Empress CAD and IPS e.max CAD - with Panavia V5.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32868946/

Sound human molar teeth (n = 30) were used for microleakage evaluations. Specimens with 60 standardized Class V cavities were divided into five groups according to the adhesive modes of universal adhesive, Adhese Universal (n = 12). Group 1-etch-and-rinse mode with phosphoric acid; Group 2-etch-and-rinse mode with Er,Cr:YSGG laser; Group 3-selective-etch mode with phosphoric acid; Group 4-selective-etch mode with Er,Cr:YSGG laser; Group 5-self-etch. After restorations were performed with a resin composite, Tetric N-Ceram, the specimens were polished and subjected to thermocycling (10,000X). Following immersion in 0.5% basic fuschin for a day, the teeth were sectioned and the degree of microleakage was determined along the tooth-resin composite interface using a light microscopy(40X). Five specimens from each group were examined by scanning electron microscopy. The Kruskal-Wallis, Siegel Castello, and Wilcoxon tests were used for statistical analyses (α = .05). At the enamel margins, significant differences were obtained among the groups (p < .05). Significantly higher microleakage scores were detected in Group 5 in comparison with Groups 1, 2, and 3. There were no significant differences between different adhesive strategies at the dentin margins (p > .05). While analyzing enamel and dentin microleakage scores, no statistically significant differences were observed in Groups 4 and 5 (p > .05). The laser application time and the adhesive modes of universal adhesives could affect the microleakage at the enamel margins.

Forty extracted permanent human mandibular molar teeth were sectioned horizontally with a disc beneath the dentino-enamel junction to expose the coronal dentin surface and later finished with 600-grit silicon carbide paper to create a uniform flat surface. Forty Lithium Di-silicate Ceramic block cylinders were sliced in a saw cutting machine at 250 rpm under water-cooling to obtain the discs. The teeth and the ceramic discs were then randomly assigned to two groups on the basis of material used for luting the ceramic disk. Group I: Ceramic disc luted with tooth surface using Variolink II Dual cure Resin Cement, Group II: Ceramic disc luted with tooth surface using multilink speed self-adhesive self-curing resin cement. All ceramic discs were etched with 5% HF acid (IPS Ceramic Etching Gel, Ivoclar, Schaan, Liechtenstein) for 20 seconds, then rinsed thoroughly for 20 seconds and dried for 20 seconds. Ceramic specimens were luted on dentin surfaces with the application of 5 kg load. The samples were stored in 75% ethanol solution for 2 weeks at 37 degree Celsius for chemical aging. HPLC Analysis were performed to analyze the eluted monomer. After HPLC Analysis, Samples were then loaded using universal testing machine for the evaluation of shear bond strength between ceramic discs and the resin cements before and after the elution of monomers.
Under HPLC analysis, results showed that the peak release of monomer is Bis-GMA in both the groups. The shear force required to break the bond between the ceramic luted to tooth surface with the resin cements were more for Group I. Statistical results: The statistical analysis was done using ANOVA and paired t-test and it shows P value ≥0.05, hence the null hypothesis is rejected.
The monomer eluded from all the groups are identified as Bis-GMA, The eluded monomer decreases the bond strength between the resin cement and the ceramic due to water sorption, The Variolink II (dual cure) resin cement shows improved bond strength than the Multilink (self-cure self-adhesive) resin cement.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32769285/

After 7 d, when dentin was absent, 2SE and CLA achieved significantly higher cell viability. The presence of dentin resulted in a drastically higher cell viability for all materials, except 2SE and CLA. UNI had the lowest C=C conversion. The presence of dentin was a significant factor, which resulted in higher cell viability than what was seen for the material specimens per se.

After generating 4 groups according to the surface etching method (37% orthophosphoric acid, Er:YAG laser-contact handpiece/scanning handpiece (1 or 2 times of scanning)), ceramic discs were luted to the surfaces with adhesive resin cement (Variolink N, Vivadent Ets., Schaan/Liechtenstein). After etching and cementation, thermocycling of 5000 cycles (Sd Mechatronık Gmbh, Feldkirchen-Westerham, Germany) and SBS test (Servopulser EHFFD1; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) were performed respectively. The surface morphologies of 2 specimens, etched enamel and dentin, prepared for each group were examined with SEM analysis. Failure modes were determined under a USB digital microscope. Data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD test (α = 0.05). SBS values in dentin surfaces showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) among tested groups. The highest SBS among dentin groups was determined in the group which had 2 times etching by Er:YAG laser (11.42 MPa) by a scanning handpiece. No statistical differences were observed in the other dentin or enamel groups. Laser etching seems to be a viable alternative to acid etching on both enamel and dentin surfaces while double etching of dentin with a scanning handpiece can improve the adhesion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32696424/

To enhance tooth movement and broaden the spectrum of malocclusions that can be treated with aligners, composite resin attachments are routinely bonded with the acid-etch technique on multiple teeth, a process known to impose irreversible alterations of the enamel structure, color, gloss, and roughness. Additionally, this clinical setting introduces a unique scenario of different materials applied in a manner that involves the development of friction and attrition between the attachment and the softer aligner material, all performing in the harsh conditions of the oral environment, which impact the aging of these materials. The latter may give rise to alterations of the aligners and the composite attachments and potential intraoral release of Bisphenol A, a known endocrine disrupting agent. Furthermore, at the final stages of contemporary aligner treatment, the removal of multiple, sometimes bulky, composite attachments with a volume and surface far greater than the remnant adhesive after debonding of brackets, through grinding that might be associated with pulmonary effects for the patient or staff. Because of the extensive enamel involvement in bonding, the release of factors from the attachment-aligner complex during service, the aging of these entities in the oral environment, and the laborious debonding/composite grinding process coupled with the hazardous nature of aerosol produced during the removal of these bulky specimens, appropriate risk management considerations should be applied and an effort to confine the application of multiple composite specimens bonded to enamel to the absolutely necessary should be pursued.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32624347/

It has multifactorial etiology and may occur due to normal and abnormal tooth function and may also be accompanied by pathological wear, such as abrasion and erosion. The theory behind the abfraction is that the tooth flexure in the cervical area is caused due to occlusal compressive forces and tensile stresses. This results in the fractures in the hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals. It is also caused by the low packing density of the Hunter-Schreger band (HSB) at the cervical area. Unfortunately, there is a lack of evidence regarding the outcome of abfraction with or without intervention. The aim of this review is to collect clinical information from the literature and discuss the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical representation, and management. Also, search databases for clinical studies that describe the role of sclerotic dentine in non-carious cervical lesions (NCCLs) are becoming a clinical challenge.
The literature was searched that described the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical representation, and management of the abfraction lesions. Also, a specific question regarding the formation of sclerotic dentin in the NCCL lesion was described and searched for evidence that challenges etching, bonding, and successfully restoring NCCLs. The databases PUBMED, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, WEB of SCIENCE, and EMBASE were searched using the key terms. The inclusion criteria were the randomized controlled clinical trial, cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies that aimed at determining the role of sclerotic dentine in NCCLs and its effect on etching, bonding.
One clinical study was retrieved according to the PRISMA flowchart and PICO format. The longer etching time, total-etch adhesive system, and EDTA pre-treatment of the sclerotic dentin of cervical wedge-shaped defects could improve the bonding strength in lesions like NCCL's.

MMP inhibitors may be used to contain this process. Objective To evaluate the degree of conversion (DC%), dentin bond strength (µTBS) (immediate and after 1 year of storage in water), and nanoleakage of an experimental (EXP) and a commercial (SB) adhesive system, containing different concentrations of the MMP inhibitor GM1489: 0, 1 µM, 5 µM and 10 µM. Methodology DC% was evaluated by FT-IR spectroscopy. Dentin bond strength was evaluated by µTBS test. Half of beams were submitted to the µTBS test after 24 h and the other half, after storage for 1 year. From each tooth and storage time, 2 beams were reserved for nanoleakage testing. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test to compare means (α=0.05). Results All adhesive systems maintained the µTBS after 1 year of storage. Groups with higher concentrations of inhibitor (5 µM and 10 µM) showed higher µTBS values than groups without inhibitor or with 1 µM. The nanoleakage values of all groups showed no increase after 1 year of storage and values were similar for SB and EXP groups, in both storage periods. The inhibitor did not affect the DC% of the EXP groups, but the SB5 and SB10 groups showed higher DC% values than those of SB0 and SB1. Conclusions The incorporation of GM1489 in the adhesive systems had no detrimental effect on DC%. The concentrations of 5 µM GM1489 for SB and 5 µM or 10 µM for EXP provided higher μTBS than groups without GM1489, in the evaluation after 1 year of storage; whereas the concentration of inhibitor did not affect adhesive systems nanoleakage.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32348441/

Human molars were randomly divided into 12 experimental groups according to: 1. application of a silver diamine fluoride solution (carious dentinal lesion without silver diamine fluoride treatment [control], with 12% silver diamine fluoride [diamine 12%] or 38% silver diamine fluoride [diamine 38%]); 2. adhesives (Clearfil Universal Bond Quick [CUQ] and Scotchbond Universal [SBU]); 3. adhesive strategy (etch-and-rinse [ER] and self-etch [SE]). After restoration, the specimens were sectioned and submitted to µTBS testing. Sticks from each tooth were used for DC evaluation. To examine the changes induced by diamine before and after phosphoric acid treatment, SEM/EDX analysis was performed. Data from the µTBS and DC tests were analyzed using three-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (α = 0.05).
Both concentrations of diamine resulted in a statistically significantly higher mean µTBS compared to the control (p < 0.0001). Diamine 38% showed a statistically significantly higher mean µTBS for both adhesives in SE mode compared to diamine 12% (p < 0.0001). The application of diamine to carious dentinal lesions did not significantly influence the mean DC values for either adhesive (p = 0.72). SBU showed a higher mean DC compared to CUQ (p = 0.03). After diamine treatment, there was an increase in the Ca peak intensity and the presence of residual silver ions mainly when diamine 38% was applied along with the SE approach.
Independent of the adhesive application approach, the use of diamine may be a promising alternative to increase µTBS without jeopardizing the DC of the two adhesives in carious dentinal lesions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32322837/

Thirty teeth were selected and divided in three groups of ten teeth according to the different dentin substrate they had: (A) normal dentin, (B) caries-affected dentin and (C) dentin contaminated by metallic oxides. The experimental cavity preparation was realised exposing in each sample, portion of pathologic dentin and portion of sound dentin as control. Each cavity was restored with micro-hybrid composite, with total etching and a two-step adhesive system. Each sample was sectioned in two halves analysed with two SEM micro-morphological methods: direct observation and decalcification. SEM investigations were able to show the difference in thickness and morphology of the adhesive interface with the two different dentin variables. Caries affected dentin determined the formation of less distinctive resin tags with few micro-tags.

One hundred twenty extracted human molars were hemisectioned and embedded in epoxy. Specimens were polished to expose enamel or dentin surfaces and randomly assigned to 12 test groups (n = 20). The tested variables were (1) the type of bonded tissue (enamel or dentin); (2) the cement used; (3) whether the cement was applied with or without a primer; (4) and whether the primer was air dried or photopolymerized. Bonding jigs were used to apply the self-adhesive resin cement to the tooth surfaces. A 2-minute self-cure was followed by 20 seconds of light curing. Specimens were stored in water for 24 hours and then subjected to SBS testing in a universal testing machine. Fractured specimens were examined under a microscope to determine the modes of failure.

To overcome this problem, mussels underwent etching in the presence of acidic pH conditions (<3.0), and thiol chemistry was used to control the propensity of DOPA for oxidation. Similar strategies deployed by mussels are also actively utilized in dental adhesives which undergo etching in the presence of phosphoric acid derivatives to maximize the bonding strength and adapt thiol chemistries to minimize shrinkage stress. In view of the similarities between dental and underwater mussel adhesives, we employ in this study the strategy of mussel adhesion-the combination of DOPA and thiol chemistry with acid etching-to one of the most critical issues in dental adhesives, namely, the dentin bonding with zirconia. As a result, the adhesion bonding between zirconia and dentin, one of the most elusive problems in dentistry, has improved compared to the commercially available adhesive resin formulation. In addition, in view of the similar human oral and mussel adhesive environments, our findings will considerably contribute to the translation of the adhesive system inspired by mussels. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Mussels are effectively operated by creating an acidic environment when adhering with 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (DOPA)-thiol redox chemistry for underwater bonding. Similarly, in dental adhesives, phosphoric acid-based etching is used for dentin-bonding materials. In view of the similarity between dental adhesives and underwater mussel adhesives, the combination of DOPA and thiol chemistry with acid etching can be used to overcome one of the most critical issues in dentin medical adhesives. The proposed adhesion method produces high adhesion strengths compared to those currently used in dentin and zirconia adhesives.

Experimental aqueous solution of 37% ortho-phosphoric acid were prepared with the addition of 2% biomodification agents: Lignin (LIG) from industrial paper production residue, Cardanol (CARD) from cashew-nut shell liquid, and Proanthocyanidin (PAC) from grape-seed extract. Negative control (NC) was acid solution without cross-linker whilst commercial control (CC) was Condac 37 gel (FGM). Dentin specimens were assayed by FTIR after 15s etching to detect collagen cross-linking. Extracted third molars were used for μTBS (n=7) and fracture mode analysis of Optibond S (Kerr), tested after 24h or 1000 thermal cycles. NL was surveyed by SEM. Statistical analysis was performed with two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p<0.05).
FTIR confirmed cross-linking for all agents. μTBS of CC was the highest (46.6±6.2MPa), but reduced significantly after aging (35.7±5.2MPa) (p<0.001). LIG (30.6±3.7MPa) and CARD (28.3±1.8MPa) attained similar μTBS which were stable after aging (p>0.05). Fracture mode was predominantly adhesive. At 24h, all groups showed presence of silver uptake in hybrid layer, except CARD. After aging, CARD- and LIG-treated specimens exhibited little amount of silver penetration. CC, PAC and NC showed gaps, great nanoleakage at hybrid layer and presence of water channels in adhesive layer.
Altogether, ortho-phosphoric acid incorporated with LIG and CARD promotes stable resin-dentin bond strength with minor nanoleakage after aging, thereby achieving therapeutic impact without additional clinical steps.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31791738/
31750802,How Do the Etching Mode and Thermomechanical Loading Influence the Marginal Integrity of Universal Adhesives?,Operative dentistry,2020,"Kaczor K, Krasowski M, Lipa S, Sokołowski J, Nowicka A","This study evaluated the effect of etching mode and thermomechanical loading on universal adhesives.
Two universal adhesives, Peak Universal and Adhese Universal, were used in two etching modes as the experimental groups: Peak Universal etch-and-rinse (PER), Peak Universal self-etch (PSE), Adhese Universal etch-and-rinse (AER), and Adhese Universal self-etch (ASE). Two adhesives considered gold standards were used as control groups: OptiBond FL (OER) was used as a control group for the etch-and-rinse (ER) mode, and Clearfil SE Bond (CSE) was used as a control group for the self-etch (SE) mode. Standardized class V cavities were created on the buccal and lingual surface in 30 extracted caries-free human third molars. Each adhesive and resin composite was applied according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specimens were subjected to thermomechanical loading (TML) immediately after the fillings were placed. Before and after TML, replicas and photographs of the fillings were performed and evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. The Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis test was used for quantitative analyses, and Fisher exact test was used for qualitative analysis.
Adhese Universal achieved a significantly higher percentage of continuous margin in the enamel than Peak Universal for the two types of etching both before and after TML (except for the SE group after TML). In dentin, the greatest percentage of continuous margin was achieved for Adhese Universal in the ER group (100%) before TML and for both universal adhesives in the SE groups (61%) after TML. For both etching modes and both time points, Adhese Universal had a greater percentage of continuous margin than Peak Universal for the whole margin. For the ER approach, significant differences were observed both before and after TML, and for the SE approach, significant differences were observed before TML. TML did not cause a significant decrease in the percentage of continuous margin in the enamel, but the results were the opposite in dentin. A qualitative assessment using World Dental Federation criteria did not show statistically significant differences between the groups.
Scanning electron microscope assessment of marginal integrity showed that the evaluated factors such as etching mode and TML significantly influenced the marginal integrity of the universal adhesives. The replica method shows that laboratory and clinical assessment methods complement each other and give a broader view of marginal integrity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31750802/

Twenty-eight sound extracted human third molars were divided in four groups (n = 7), according to dentin treatment (conventional etching or etching followed by 10% NaOCl application) and adhesive systems (GB-Gluma 2Bond and OS-One-Step). After dentin treatments and adhesive application, a composite block was built-up on dentin surface and teeth were serially sectioned to obtain bonded sticks specimens. The sticks were submitted to three aging conditions: (24H) 24 hr in water (immediate), (SH) 3 hr of NaOCl accelerated-aging or (1Y) 1 year of water storage. Afterward, submitted to microtensile bond strength test (μTBS), failure modes and adhesive interfaces analyzes. Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test (α = .05). Dentin deproteinization before bonding significantly reduced μTBS for GB-treated group (p < .05), regardless the aging conditions. Water storage for 1 year (1Y) and NaOCl accelerated-aging (SH) decreased μTBS for both adhesives. Yet, the groups stored in NaOCl (SH) exhibited the lowest BS results (p < .05). Bond strength of deproteinized dentin was dependent on the adhesive system composition and NaOCl accelerated-aging promoted decreased bond strength and further degradation than water storage for 1 year.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31701615/

The adhesives were tested in different etching modes, etch-and-rinse (ER) or self-etch (SE), and under thermomechanical loading (TML). Two identical Class V cavities were prepared in each of 30 human third molar teeth, and resin-composite restorations were made. Before and after TML, replicas of the restorations were prepared. Gap formation and their frequency according to the modified classification of Blunck and Zaslansky and the width of the maximum marginal gap (MG) were separately evaluated in enamel and dentin. Gap frequency did not differ significantly only in the enamel before TML, despite the use of different adhesives or etching modes. At both timepoints, the highest MG values were obtained with the Peak Universal Bond self-etch (PSE) group in enamel (6.2 μm before TML, 12.2 μm after TML) and the Peak Universal Bond etch-and-rinse (PER) group in dentine (21.3 μm before TML, 35.5 μm after TML). After TML, there was a significant increase of gap frequency for Adhese universal self-etch (ASE) group and MG values for PER, PSE, ASE groups at the resin-enamel interface, and gap frequency and MG values for all groups at the resin-dentin interface. Universal adhesive with 10-MDP monomer have beneficial effect on the resin-dentin interface, while chlorhexidine may reduce the resistance of the universal adhesive system to oral cavity conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31682323/

The aim of our study was to compare the bonding of a metal orthodontic bracket ""in vitro"" under different types of healthy enamel surface preparations and with two bonding products: the composite and the Resin Modified Glass Ionomer Cement (RMGIC).
Premolars preserved in 1% thymol water were bonded on their vestibular and palatal/lingual surfaces with different techniques of bonding and surface preparation: Group 1: Etching+Bonding+Composite, Group 2: Etching+Fuji Ortho LC, Group 3: V-prep+Fuji Ortho LC, Group 4: V-prep+Fuji Ortho LC+Thermocycling. The SBS was measured in Newton on the universal testing machine and the sample was observed under an optical microscope with 10-fold magnification to note the adhesive remnant index score (ARI), before and after thermocycling.
120 premolars were used in this study. RMGIC bonding was significantly increased when the surface was prepared at V-prep (P<0.001). In these conditions, RMGIC bonding on the buccal surface was similar to that of the composite and superior on the palatal/lingual surface (P=1). After 2 years of aging using a thermocycling machine for simulation, RMGIC bonding significantly decreased (P<0.001). The ARI score was significantly lower for the RMGIC group than the composite group (P<0.001).
RMGIC bonding with V-prep preparation is recommended for palatal/lingual surfaces and for hard-to-dry surfaces. For vestibular surfaces, studies are still needed to recommend bonding with RMGIC instead of composite.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31495756/

A randomized, controlled, double-blind, split-mouth, two-arm clinical trial was conducted. Twenty-seven volunteers with third molars indicated for extraction received two deep class I restorations, one with each material. Postoperative sensitivity was measured at 24 h and 15 or 30 days after the restorative procedures using a visual analog scale (VAS). When present, information on the characteristics of the pain was also collected. The data were submitted to the McNemar test (α = 0.05).
Regardless of the time intervals, the postoperative sensitivity was observed in 52% and 48% of the CSEB and VERT groups, respectively (p = 1.000). When the evaluation periods were analyzed, the 15-day evaluation presented the highest occurrence of pain, but of mild intensity, in both groups. All patients with sensitivity reported that the pain was localized and of short duration.
Self-adhesive resin composite Vertise Flow and conventional resin composite with a self-etching bonding agent promoted similar response regarding postoperative sensitivity in deep class I cavities. When postoperative sensitivity was present, mild pain was observed, especially after 15 days of the restorative procedure, which decreased over time.
Postoperative sensitivity to self-adhesive resin composite (SAC) restorations in deep cavities was comparable with that of conventional restorations with a self-etching bonding agent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31410676/

Human molar dentin surfaces, eroded by soft drinks or citric acid, were acid-etched and treated with primers containing proanthocyanidin (PA) and riboflavin (RI) or were untreated (control) and tested after 24 h and 2 years. After acid etching and adhesive application (Prime&Bond Elect (PBE); Scotchbond Universal (SBU); Tetric n-bond Universal (TEU)), specimens were sectioned into beams and tested for microtensile bond strength (μTBS) and silver nitrate deposition (NL) after 24 h and 2 years. The beams were used to evaluate the 24-h in situ conversion of degree (DC). Nanohardness (NH) and Young's modulus (YM) were evaluated via resin-bonded dentin slices after 24 h and 2 years. A three-way ANOVA and Tukey's test were used for statistical analysis (5%).
For both storage times, ED with citric acid resulted in lower μTBS, NH, and YM and higher NL for each adhesive system than soft drink ED (p < 0.05). After 2 years of water storage, cross-linking primers maintained the μTBS, NH, and YM (p < 0.05) when compared with the control group. Althougth, the NL values decreased for all groups after 2 years of water storage, PA and RI treatments showed NI values lower than control group (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between PA and RI treatments (p > 0.05). Cross-linking primers maintain or improve DC (p < 0.03). In general, TEU and SBU yielded higher μTBS, DC, NH, and YM and lower NL than PBE.

This study investigated learning outcomes when using etch-and-rinse and self-etch adhesives among general practitioners in a hands-on bonding test course.
We recruited 30 general practitioners to perform shear bond strength (SBS) tests using five adhesives: one Peak® Universal Bond (PUB) etch-and-rinse and four Futurabond DC, Single Bond universal (SBU), Versa Optibond (VOB), and Tetric-N Bond Self-Etch (TNS) self-etch adhesives. SBS tests were conducted at pre-demonstration (pre-demo), post-demonstration (post-demo), and 24-h storage (delayed bonding) stages. SBS data were analyzed with paired Student's t-tests. We defined 17 MPa as ""qualified bond strength (QBS)"". The percentages of samples with SBS achieving QBS were analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests. The fracture surfaces of the samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Using PUB caused no significant differences in SBS between pre- and post-demo samples, whereas the SBS of the two self-etch adhesives (SBU and VOB) improved in post-demo samples (p < 0.05). SBU showed the highest percentage of samples with SBS achieving QBS in all three groups (pre-demo = 70%, post-demo = 83%, and delayed bonding = 76.5%). The QBS percentages of VOB and TNS notably improved from 0% (pre-demo) to 71.4% and 23.5% (post-demo), respectively. SEM indicated bubble-like defects at the dentin-resin interfaces in cases of low SBS.

Scotchbond Universal Adhesive (SBU, 3M Oral Care) was applied in NCCLs of 39 subjects using four adhesion strategies: (1) three-step ER (etch-and-rinse), (2) two-step ER, (3) two-step SE (self-etch), and (4) one-step SE. An extra layer of a hydrophobic bonding resin was applied for strategies three-step ER and two-step SE. The same composite resin (Filtek Supreme XTE, 3M Oral Care) was used for all strategies. Restorations were evaluated at baseline and 18 and 36 months using the modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, Friedman, and Wilcoxon non-parametric tests were computed.
The cumulative failure rate was 8.6%. The 36-month retention rates were 100% for both 3-ER and 2-ER, 76.0% for 2-SE, and 86.2% for 1-SE. A lower retention rate was observed for two-step SE at 36 months compared with both three-ER (p < 0.01) and two-ER (p < 0.01). Identical retention rates were measured for the two SE groups. When retention rate was compared at baseline versus 36 months for each adhesion strategy, a significant decrease was observed for 2-SE. The restorations performed with 3-ER, 2-SE, and 1-SE had a significant deterioration in marginal discoloration at the 18-month recall.
The 36-month clinical performance of Scotchbond Universal Adhesive improved for both etch-and-rinse strategies.
