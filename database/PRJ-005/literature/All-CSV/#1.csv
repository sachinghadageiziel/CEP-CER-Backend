The purpose of this in vitro study was to quantify and compare the quality of the marginal seal when different materials and bonding techniques were used to restore endodontic access cavities in zirconia cylinders. Fifty custom zirconia cylinders (10.0 mm in diameter × 14.0 mm in height; wall thickness of 1.5 mm) were prepared with simulated endodontic access cavities (5.0 mm in diameter). The cylindrical specimens were divided into 5 groups, each assigned a different method of access cavity restoration (n = 10 per group): direct glass ionomer cement restorations; direct composite resin restorations adhesively bonded without prior aluminum oxide (Al",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40079880/
39515181,"An in vitro study of orthodontic brackets bonded to transition dental zirconia: Shear bond strength, adhesive remnant index, and surface irregularities.",International orthodontics,2025,"Roberts G, Xu X, Kee E, Chapple A, Bartels V, Armbruster P, Ballard R","Orthodontic treatment often involves bonding brackets to teeth, and the protocols for natural enamel differ from those for prosthodontically restored teeth. With the rising number of adult orthodontic patients, many present with zirconia crowns. This study aimed to evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) of ceramic orthodontic brackets bonded to transition dental zirconia, which combines 3Y-TZP and 5Y-TZP powders.
Ninety zirconia substrates were divided into three groups (n=30) based on transition zirconia brands (3M ESPE Lava™ Plus, Cercon® ht ML, and Katana™ Zirconia UTML) and bonded with ceramic brackets (CHIC Ceramic Roth Maxillary and Symetri Clear) using 3M™ Transbond™ XT. A control group used traditional zirconia and metal brackets. Surface treatments included 50-micron aluminium oxide abrasion and Z-Prime™ Plus application. SBS was tested post-thermocycling. Adhesive Resin Index (ARI) was scored and surface roughness was evaluated pre- and post-bonding.
Group 1 (3M ESPE Lava™ Plus with CHIC Ceramic Roth Maxillary brackets) had a significantly lower SBS (mean 13.27MPa) compared to the other groups, which all had SBS values above 18.80MPa (P≤.023). Group 2 (3M ESPE Lava™ Plus with Symetri™ Clear) demonstrated a significantly higher mean ARI compared to the control group (Cercon® XT with Victory Series™ Roth), (P=.027). Additionally, significant changes in surface roughness were observed in Groups B (Cercon® ht ML) (P=.008) and C (Katana™ Zirconia UTML) (P=.016).
This study determined that the shear bond strength of various transitional zirconia substrates with ceramic brackets exceeded the clinically acceptable SBS levels. The combination of 3M ESPE Lava™ Plus and Symetri™ Clear exhibited significant variation in ARI. Additionally, significant surface irregularities were observed in 3M ESPE Lava™ Plus and Cercon® ht ML following air abrasion, compared to other transitional zirconia brands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39515181/
39476015,Biomimetic Restorative Dentistry: an evidence-based discussion of common myths.,Journal of applied oral science : revista FOB,2024,"Reis A, Feitosa VP, Chibinski AC, Favoreto MW, Gutierrez MF, Loguercio AD","This narrative review critically examines some protocols of biomimetic restorative dentistry (BRD), which supposedly outperforms traditional adhesive techniques. This review explores the origins of BRD, introduces cognitive biases influencing the adoption of BRD protocols without evidence scrutiny, and discusses nine BRD protocols. For this, we searched randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews in the literature on the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library CENTRAL databases, which lead to the following conclusions about the revised protocols: 1) The use of dyes excessively removes carious dentin; 2) Aluminum oxide air abrasion contributes to overtreatment and may pose long-term health risks to dental professionals; 3) Beveling enamel in posterior teeth is technically difficult and leads to unnecessary loss of adjacent sound enamel with no evidence of its use outperforming butt-joint preparations; 4) Deactivating matrix metalloproteinases with chlorhexidine shows no clinical evidence of improving restoration longevity. 5) ""Elected"" gold-standard adhesive systems perform no better than other good performing available systems; 6) Immediate dentin sealing and resin coating result in similar post-operative sensitivity and longevity of indirect fillings as delayed dentin sealing; 7) Deep margin elevation is a viable alternative to manage subgingival margins in occlusoproximal cavities; 8) The process of ""decoupling"" with time lacks scientific evidence to support its use; 9) Placing fiber inserts on the pulpal floor and/or axial wall to minimize stress offers no benefits over current alternatives. In conclusion, more rigorous research is needed to validate BRD protocols, focusing on important clinical outcomes that impact in the longevity of the restoration, such as fracture, debonding, post-operative sensitivity, esthetic quality, presence of caries lesions adjacent to restorations and patients' satisfaction need to be thoroughly investigated. Reliance on anecdotal evidence, clinical experience, and common sense propagates myths and undervalues the need for a critical approach in evaluating dental techniques.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39476015/

A systematic review and meta-analysis of in vitro studies.,Journal of dentistry,2024,"D'Alessandro C, Josic U, Mazzitelli C, Maravic T, Graham L, Barausse C, Mazzoni A, Breschi L, Blatz MB","This systematic review aimed to determine the effectiveness of various etching surface treatments on zirconia bond strength with the following research question: ""Can zirconia etching serve as a viable alternative to airborne particle abrasion (APA) for achieving reliable bonding?"".
In vitro studies comparing APA, performed with either conventional or silica-coated aluminum oxide (Al
A comprehensive literature search was conducted across electronic databases, including Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus and ProQuest.
Fifty-four relevant articles were included in this systematic review. According to the QUIN's tool, 7 studies were rated as ""high risk of bias"", 46 studies were rated as ""medium risk"", and 1 study was rated as ""low risk"". Nineteen studies were used for meta-analyses. Mostly, APA demonstrated significantly higher bond strength compared to various etching protocols (p < 0.05). However, no statistical difference was found between APA and high concentrations (40-48 %) of hydrofluoric acid (HF) in terms of immediate- and medium-term bond strength to resin composite (p > 0.05). On enamel, an experimental hot etching solution performed significantly better than APA in short-term follow-up (p < 0.05). A novel multi-acid solution exhibited significantly higher immediate shear bond strength to resin cement than APA (p < 0.05). Variable heterogeneity, ranging from low to high, was observed.
APA remains the surface treatment with the strongest evidence in the literature and it is usually more efficacious than zirconia etching. However, highly concentrated HF and an experimental hot etching solution have demonstrated similar or significantly higher bond strength values over time compared to APA, depending on the adhesive substrate. A recently introduced multi-acid solution (Zircos-E) needs to be further explored, especially in regards to long-term bond durability.
This systematic review provides a comprehensive analysis of the existing in vitro evidence on the potential of zirconia etching and the bond durability of resin-based materials after artificial aging. Selecting appropriate surface treatment protocols is crucial for achieving optimal clinical outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39374733/
38698366,Effect of surface treatment and resin cement type on the bond strength of polyetheretherketone to lithium disilicate ceramic.,BMC oral health,2024,"Adeeb Gabra EN, Sadek HMA, Hamdy AM, Wahsh MM","This study aims to evaluate the effect of surface treatment and resin cement on the shear bond strength (SBS) and mode of failure of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) to lithium disilicate ceramic (LDC). This is suggested to study alternative veneering of PEEK frameworks with a ceramic material.
eighty discs were prepared from PEEK blank and from lithium disilicate ceramic. Samples were divided into four groups according to surface treatment: Group (A) air abraded with 110 μm Al
The highest mean of shear bond strength values was demonstrated in Group of air abrasion with primer application using conventional resin cement (APB) (12.21 ± 2.14 MPa). Sulfuric acid groups showed lower shear bond strength values and the majority failed in thermocycling especially when no primer was applied. The failure mode analysis showed that the predominant failure type was adhesive failure between cement and PEEK, while the remaining was mixed failure between cement and PEEK.
The air abrasion followed by primer application and conventional resin cement used for bonding Lithium Disilicate to PEEK achieved the best bond strength. Primer application did not have an effect when self-adhesive resin cement was used in air-abraded groups. Priming step is mandatory whenever sulfuric acid etching surface treatment is utilized for PEEK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38698366/

Air-abrasion/polishing did not impair dentin bond strength using G2B, except when dentin was air abraded with AO29 and using G2B in SE mode. Air polishing positively influenced the bond strength to dentin in specific groups.
APA is safe concerning bonding to dentin. The E&R application mode is preferred using G2B as adhesive on air-abraded/polished dentin. Air polishing with BG positively influenced dentin bond strength for both application methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38461887/

[et al.],2024,"Almeida G, Marques JA, Van Meerbeek B, Ramos JC, Falacho RI","This scoping review aims to assess the influence of air abrasion with aluminum oxide and bioactive glass on dentin bond strength.
An electronic search was conducted in three databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase), on March 3rd, 2023, with previously identified MeSH Terms. A total of 1023 records were screened. Exclusion criteria include primary teeth, air abrasion of a substrate other than sound dentin, use of particles apart from aluminum oxide or bioactive glass, and studies in which bond strength was not assessed.
Out of the 1023 records, title and abstract screening resulted in the exclusion of 895 and 67 studies, respectively, while full-text analysis excluded another 25 articles. In addition, 5 records were not included, as full texts could not be obtained after requesting the authors. Two cross-references were added. Thus, 33 studies were included in this review. It is important to emphasize the absence of standardization of air abrasion parameters. According to 63.6% of the studies, air abrasion does not influence dentin bond strength. Moreover, 30.3% suggest improving bonding performance, and 6.1% advocate a decrease.
Air abrasion with aluminum oxide does not enhance or impair dentin bond strength. The available data on bioactive glass are limited, which hinders conclusive insights.
Dentin air abrasion is a widely applied technique nowadays, with numerous clinical applications. Despite the widespread adoption of this procedure, its potential impact on bonding performance requires a thorough analysis of the existing literature.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38130045/

This in vitro study included 156 samples from 3 brands of high-translucent zirconia split into a control group and 4 surface treatment groups: 9.6% hydrofluoric acid etching, 50-micron aluminium oxide particle air abrasion, and 30-micron tribochemical silica coating (TBS) particle air abrasion with and without silane application. After surface treatment, all groups were primed with a 10-MDP primer and bonded to metal orthodontic brackets. Shear bond strength (SBS) was tested and results were compared between all groups. Data analysis consisted of a balanced two-factor factorial ANOVA, a Shapiro-Wilks test, and a non-parametric permutation test. The significance level was set at 0.05.
Among all surface treatments, aluminium oxide particle abrasion produced significantly higher SBS (P≤0.002). Lava™ Plus zirconia samples had significantly higher SBS than Cercon® samples (P<0.0001). TBS surface treatment produced significantly higher SBS on Lava™ Plus samples than it did on the other zirconia brands (P=0.032).
This study indicated that mechanical abrasion using aluminium oxide in combination with a 10-MDP primer creates a higher SBS to high-translucent zirconia than the bond created by tribochemical silica coating. Also, there was no significant difference in ARI regardless of zirconia brand or surface preparation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37992472/

Bilayer ceramic discs were made from zirconia blocks (IPS e.max Zircad MO, Ivoclar Vivadent - 0.7 mm thickness) and randomized into 8 groups (n= 15) according to two factors: 'zirconia surface treatment' (Control; Grinding - diamond bur; Air-abrasion - aluminum oxide particles; and Liner - application of a ceramic liner [IPS e.max Zirliner, Ivoclar Vivadent]); and 'thermocycling' (presence - 12,000 thermal cycles; 5-55ºC; or absence). The discs were veneered with porcelain (IPS e.max Ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent - 0.7 mm; totaling 1.4 mm thickness) according to ISO 6872:2015 for biaxial flexure strength testing. Fatigue tests (step-stress approach; 20 to 100 MPa; step of 10 MPa; 10,000 cycles per step; 10 Hz frequency) were run, followed by the data analysis (Kaplan-Meier and Mantel-Cox post-hoc tests). Analysis of roughness, topography, crystallographic phase arranges and fractography were also executed.
The surface treatment and thermocycling did not influence the porcelain crack nor delamination resistance. When only comparing the surface treatments for crack resistance outcome, the liner application depicted the worst fatigue performance in comparison to grinding and air-abrasion, while all groups were similar for delamination.
Neither the surface treatment of the zirconia nor the thermocycling influences the porcelain crack resistance or the resistance to delamination of the bilayer porcelain-veneered zirconia specimens.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33028796/

In this systematic review the authors investigated how airborne-particle abrasion (APA) using aluminum oxide affects the bond strength of resin-based materials to dentin. The search was performed in three databases. In vitro studies (Type of study) comparing the bond strength of resin-based materials (Outcome) to air-abraded (Intervention) compared with non-air-abraded (Comparison) human dentin (Population) were included (the PICOT elements are given parenthetically). From 5437 unique articles, 65 were read in full, 33 were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 32 were included in the meta-analysis. Methodologic quality and risk of bias were assessed. Comparisons were performed between air-abraded and control dentin groups by adopting a random-effects model (α=0.05). Additional analyses were carried out for the different parameters used in APA: type of surface treatment in the control group, particle size, air pressure, and APA duration. The bond strength to air-abraded dentin was favored only when the control surface was treated with a hand excavator. For particle size, APA was favored when the particle size was >30 μm and the controls were no treatment or hand excavator or when the particle size was ≤30 μm and the control was bur. In addition, the results favored air-abraded groups only when the pressure was > 5 bar and bur was used in the control group. No significant differences were observed for duration of APA. No comparison on bond strength considering the presence of aging conditions was possible in the included studies due to the low number of studies that aged the specimens. In conclusion, APA had no negative effects on the bond strength of resin-based materials to dentin and was able to improve the dentin bond strength only when the particle size was > 30 μm and air pressure was > 5 bar.

31471241,In vitro comparison of shear bond strengths of ceramic orthodontic brackets with ceramic crowns using an aluminium oxide air abrasion etchant.,International orthodontics,2020,"Oldham CC, Ballard RW, Yu Q, Kee EL, Xu X, Armbruster PC","The aim of this study was to determine if there are differences between the shear bond strengths of 3 types of ceramic brackets when bonded to different ceramic substrates using an aluminium oxide air abrasion etchant protocol.
Substrate groups consisting of thirty-six lithium disilicate (e.max® CAD) samples and thirty-six lithium silicate infused with zirconia (CELTRA® DUO) samples were fabricated to replicate the facial surface of a left maxillary central incisor. The surface of all samples was prepared with an aluminium oxide air abrasion etchant protocol. Each substrate group was split into three test groups (n=12). Each test group was bonded using a different brand of ceramic orthodontic bracket. Shear bond strength (SBS) testing was conducted and the mean SBS values for each group were calculated and recorded in MPa. An Adhesive Resin Index (ARI) score was also assigned to each sample to assess the location of bond failure.
Mean SBS of the e.max® CAD groups were significantly less than the CELTRA® DUO groups. Symetri brackets showed significantly higher shear bond strengths to both substrates than both of the other brackets tested. ARI scores of the e.max® CAD groups were significantly less than the CELTRA® DUO groups.
The Symetri bracket was the only bracket that was effective for both substrates (mean SBS>6mPa). The Etch Master protocol does not appear effective for e.max® CAD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31471241/
