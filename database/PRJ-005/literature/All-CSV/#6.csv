39476015,Biomimetic Restorative Dentistry: an evidence-based discussion of common myths.,Journal of applied oral science : revista FOB,2024,"Reis A, Feitosa VP, Chibinski AC, Favoreto MW, Gutierrez MF, Loguercio AD","This narrative review critically examines some protocols of biomimetic restorative dentistry (BRD), which supposedly outperforms traditional adhesive techniques. This review explores the origins of BRD, introduces cognitive biases influencing the adoption of BRD protocols without evidence scrutiny, and discusses nine BRD protocols. For this, we searched randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews in the literature on the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library CENTRAL databases, which lead to the following conclusions about the revised protocols: 1) The use of dyes excessively removes carious dentin; 2) Aluminum oxide air abrasion contributes to overtreatment and may pose long-term health risks to dental professionals; 3) Beveling enamel in posterior teeth is technically difficult and leads to unnecessary loss of adjacent sound enamel with no evidence of its use outperforming butt-joint preparations; 4) Deactivating matrix metalloproteinases with chlorhexidine shows no clinical evidence of improving restoration longevity. 5) ""Elected"" gold-standard adhesive systems perform no better than other good performing available systems; 6) Immediate dentin sealing and resin coating result in similar post-operative sensitivity and longevity of indirect fillings as delayed dentin sealing; 7) Deep margin elevation is a viable alternative to manage subgingival margins in occlusoproximal cavities; 8) The process of ""decoupling"" with time lacks scientific evidence to support its use; 9) Placing fiber inserts on the pulpal floor and/or axial wall to minimize stress offers no benefits over current alternatives. In conclusion, more rigorous research is needed to validate BRD protocols, focusing on important clinical outcomes that impact in the longevity of the restoration, such as fracture, debonding, post-operative sensitivity, esthetic quality, presence of caries lesions adjacent to restorations and patients' satisfaction need to be thoroughly investigated. Reliance on anecdotal evidence, clinical experience, and common sense propagates myths and undervalues the need for a critical approach in evaluating dental techniques.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39476015/
37816489,Effects of silane coupling treatment on the clinical performance of direct repaired resin-based composite (RBC) restorations with or without prior surface sandblasting: A randomized controlled trial.,Journal of dentistry,2023,"Albashaireh ZSM, Maghaireh GA, Alsaafeen HN","To evaluate the effects, of using silane coupling agent within the procedures of repairing old composite restorations with or without sandblasting their surfaces, on the clinical performance of repaired composite restorations.
The study involved repairing 130 Class I and II defective composite restorations. After recurrent caries removal, the repair process included etching with 37 % phosphoric acid, Adper Single Bond 2 application for bonding and Filtek Z250 composite for restoring all defects. The restoration surfaces were subjected to one of the following additional surface treatments within the repair process: Control: No additional treatment; the Silane-Adhesive treatment: A separate step involved the application of a silane coupling agent after acid etching; and the Sandblast-Silane-Adhesive treatment: included intra-oral sandblasting of old composite surfaces followed by silane application. Two calibrated examiners evaluated all repaired restorations according to a modified USPHS criteria after 6 months. Comparisons of the clinical performance between the treatment groups were made using Chi-square test, while responses to cold tests before and after repair treatment were made using Wilcoxon's Signed Rank's (α = 0.05).
Of 130 cases, only 116 cases turned up for evaluation. The primary reasons for composite repair were recurrent caries and anatomical deficiencies. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups for all clinical criteria (p > 0.05). The control group experienced one total and two partial retention losses.
The application of a silane coupling agent, with or without intra-oral sandblasting, demonstrated no improvement on the clinical performance of repaired posterior composites after 6-months.
Surface treatment of defective composite restorations using silane with intra-oral sandblasting within their repair process offered marginal improvement in their clinical performance over conventional etching technique, but insignificantly so. Repair reduced exaggerated cold test responses and eliminated POS within 6-months. Repair reduces cold sensitivity and promotes restoration longevity. This clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the registration number NCT06005571.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37816489/
