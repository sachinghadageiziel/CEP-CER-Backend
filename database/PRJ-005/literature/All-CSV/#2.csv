A double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted on patients undergoing abdominal myomectomy at a large non-university hospital in northwest Iran in 2023. A total of 60 eligible patients were randomly assigned to two groups of TIVA (n = 30) and IA (n = 30) anesthesia methods. The study groups' allocation was blinded to the anesthesiology provider and she was responsible for anesthesia and patient monitoring. The study outcomes were hemodynamic changes, bleeding during the surgery, anesthesia time, hospitalization, and postoperative complications between the study groups.
There were no significant differences in surgical indications, myoma size, hemoglobin levels, or clinical and obstetric characteristics before surgery between the two study groups (p > 0.05). The average blood loss (201.8 vs. 391.0 ml; P = 0.001), postoperative hemoglobin levels (11.6 vs. 10.5; P = 0.005), anesthesia times (100.6 vs. 114.3 min; P = 0.003), and hospitalization days (2.06 vs. 2.36; P = 0.005) showed statistically significant differences between the TIVA and IA groups, respectively. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate values were significantly higher in the IA group compared to the TIVA group (P < 0.05). No muscle stiffness, dizziness, or respiratory depression were observed after surgery in either study group. The proportion of shivering in the TIVA and IA groups was 16.7% and 43.3%, respectively, indicating a significant statistical difference (P = 0.024). The proportion of optimal surgeon performance was reported to be higher in the TIVA group compared to the IA group (P = 0.014).
According to the findings of this study, the use of the TIVA method compared to IA during the maintenance of general anesthesia was linked to a reduction in intraoperative bleeding and transfusion requirements, as well as increased optimal surgeon performance in patients undergoing abdominal myomectomy. Furthermore, patients in the TIVA group experienced fewer complications during and after surgery, along with a shorter hospital stay.
The study protocol was retrospectively registered and confirmed in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials under the number (IRCT20220930056059N1). Registration date: 2022-11-13. Expected recruitment start date: 2022-11-11.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41034776/

Secondary brain insults related to oxygenation and ventilation may affect outcomes in this high-risk population. The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive review examining the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide thresholds and mortality to guide clinical care.
Eleven databases, including: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, Biosys, Scopus, and the Global Index Medicus, were systematically searched from inception to October 23, 2024. Included studies reported on adults (≥18 years) with moderate to severe TBI (msTBI) (Glasgow Coma Scale <13 or Head Abbreviated Injury Scale ≥3) and exposure to hypoxia, hypocapnia, or hypercapnia, with mortality or vegetative state data reported within 6 months. Vegetative state data was not reported, so all analyses were based on mortality. Pediatric or mild TBI studies, stroke-focused studies, and studies without mortality outcomes were excluded. The data were screened via Covidence software with multiple reviewers. No language or regional restrictions were applied. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Quality was assessed via the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for Cohort Studies, and certainty of evidence was rated using GRADE. Four authors independently extracted data with verification by a second reviewer. The primary outcome was measured using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), calculated separately for crude and adjusted effect estimates.
Twenty-one cohort studies with 41,980 patients were included. Hypoxia and hypocapnia were significantly associated with increased mortality (aOR, 1.39; 95% CI 1.11-1.75; p =.005; aOR, 1.64; 95% CI 1.25-2.15; p <.001). Hypercapnia was not significantly associated with mortality (aOR, 1.74; 95% CI 0.91-3.32; p =.09).
In adults with msTBI, hypoxia and hypocapnia were independently associated with increased mortality, underscoring the importance of prompt recognition and targeted management of these secondary injuries. The role of hypercapnia remains unclear, warranting further investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40814097/

40632005,Safety of nonoperating room anesthesia: a narrative review.,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2025,"Kaye AD, Rogers BN, Mashaw S, Mosieri CN, Urman RD, Shekoohi S","Nonoperating room anesthesia (NORA) has become increasingly relevant as diagnostic and therapeutic procedures move beyond traditional surgical settings. This shift introduces unique safety challenges, making it crucial to evaluate how NORA can maintain patient safety and procedural efficiency despite the lack of standardized environments and resources typical of operating rooms.
Studies reveal that NORA often involves patients with complex comorbidities, requiring meticulous risk assessment and preparation. Common challenges include limited equipment availability, difficulties in patient monitoring, and restricted access to emergency support. Portable 3 monitoring devices, streamlined sedation techniques, and advancements in anesthesia technology have contributed to improved safety. However, these advancements underscore the importance of adhering to protocols tailored to the unique needs of each procedural setting.
Addressing NORA's safety challenges requires rigorous preoperative evaluation, adherence to high monitoring standards, and effective communication between anesthesia teams and procedural staff. Further research and standardized guidelines are essential to optimize patient outcomes, minimize risks, and ensure the safe delivery of anesthesia in nontraditional settings. These measures will support the continued evolution and success of NORA in modern healthcare.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40632005/
40598240,Implicit bias in ICU electronic health record data: measurement frequencies and missing data rates of clinical variables.,BMC medical informatics and decision making,2025,"Shi J, Hubbard AE, Fong N, Pirracchio R","Systematic disparities in data collection within electronic health records (EHRs), defined as non-random patterns in the measurement and recording of clinical variables across demographic groups, can be reflective of underlying implicit bias and may affect patient outcome. Identifying and mitigating these biases is critical for ensuring equitable healthcare. This study aims to develop an analytical framework for measurement patterns, defined as the combination of measurement frequency (how often variables are collected) and missing data rates (the frequency of missing recordings), evaluate the association between them and demographic factors, and assess their impact on in-hospital mortality prediction.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, which includes data on over 40,000 ICU patients from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (2001-2012). Adult patients with ICU stays longer than 24 h were included. Measurement patterns, including missing data rates and measurement frequencies, were derived from EHR data and analyzed. Targeted Machine Learning (TML) methods were used to assess potential systematic disparities in measurement patterns across demographic factors (age, gender, race/ethnicity) while controlling for confounders such as other demographics and disease severity. The predictive power of measurement patterns on in-hospital mortality was evaluated.
Among 23,426 patients, significant demographic systematic disparities were observed in the first 24 h of ICU stays. Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) had more frequent temperature measurements compared to younger patients, while males had slightly fewer missing temperature measurements than females. Racial disparities were notable: White patients had more frequent blood pressure and oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurements compared to Black and Hispanic patients. Measurement patterns were associated with ICU mortality, with models based solely on these patterns achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.74-0.77).
This study underscores the significance of measurement patterns in ICU EHR data, which are associated with patient demographics and ICU mortality. Analyzing patterns of missing data and measurement frequencies provides valuable insights into patient monitoring practices and potential systemic disparities in healthcare delivery. Understanding these disparities is critical for improving the fairness of healthcare delivery and developing more accurate predictive models in critical care settings.

The role of the PEN was to assist with patients in the PACU showing signs of altered hemodynamics and to deliver prompt interventions. This role was to prevent failure-to-rescue events in the PACU. The PEN facilitated patient transfer to the appropriate ward when the timing was safe. The PEN also acted as a resource for less-experienced staff and for high-risk medications, procedures, and equipment that were infrequently encountered. The PEN collaborated with nursing and medical staff, providing real-time education and support.
Quality Improvement Project using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Plan-Do-Study-Act worksheet.
On approval for the PEN resource, it was necessary to refine roles and responsibilities. Clinical decision-making, communication skills, critical care experience, and employment greater than 1 year in the institution's PACU were determined to be necessary for success in the role. Additional specialized education was provided on medical event management. Topics included hypoxia, hypotension, and bleeding. Events were categorized by frequency and clinical condition.
The implementation of a specialized resource, or PEN, supported the staff and provided an additional layer of patient safety. Our 2023 data revealed that only 4.8% of patients evaluated by PEN in the PACU required a rapid response call within the first 24 hours post anesthesia compared to 11.1% before the PEN. When surveyed, staff positively endorsed the addition of the PEN in the PACU with 100% of responding nurses considering it a beneficial resource during medical events in the PACU. The PEN program highlighted both gaps and opportunities for practice change in the PACU. Partnership with our anesthesia colleagues has led to change implementation. Examples include patient monitoring during transport and bringing vasoactive drips out with the patient if recently discontinued.
After a successful 8-week pilot, the PEN was incorporated into the PACU staffing model. The addition of the PEN role in the PACU may help decrease perianesthesia failure-to-rescue events, encourage collaborative medical event management, and help staff feel more supported. Evaluation by PEN in the PACU decreased the number of rapid response calls on those same patients admitted to the ward for the first 24 hours after the end of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40542810/

Ethiopia has initiated a nationwide strategic plan aimed at tackling obstacles within the surgical system. The aim of this study was to assess surgical and anesthesia care capacity and productivity in high volume Ethiopian hospitals.
An explanatory mixed-methods study was conducted in 24 high-volume public hospitals across Ethiopia's 10 regions and 2 city administrations. Data were collected through structured document reviews, site observations, and interviews using a validated WHO-aligned tool. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS, and qualitative responses were thematically analyzed using ATLAS.ti.
Addis Ababa hosts over 60% of the national surgical workforce, highlighting stark regional disparities. While 80% of hospitals reported adequate infrastructure, site observations revealed functional inconsistencies in PACU design, sterilization units, and equipment availability. Only 77% of hospitals consistently implemented patient monitoring and handover protocols. Surgical productivity was low, with an average of 2.5 surgeries per week per clinician and 52.39% annual workforce productivity. Best practices included the use of EMRs, backlog-reduction campaigns, and daily interdisciplinary briefings. However, persistent challenges included inadequate staffing, poor infrastructure, and uneven adoption of safety protocols.
Ethiopia's surgical system shows promising innovations in select hospitals, yet national scale-up is hindered by infrastructure gaps, uneven workforce distribution, and inconsistent safety practices. Addressing these challenges requires data-driven planning, targeted investment in underserved regions, and expanded use of digital systems and collaborative networks to promote best practice adoption across facilities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40426140/

Trauma, surgery, and infection/inflammation exacerbate CAD. The present report describes the successful perioperative management of a patient with CAD who underwent outpatient total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
A 70-yr-old female was diagnosed with CAD in 2016 with symptoms of pain and pallor in her fingertips, numbness and bluish discoloration of her tongue, and shortness of breath. She was treated with folic acid, rituximab, and bendamustine. After remaining symptom-free for 4 yrs and following consultation with hematology, she was scheduled to undergo TKA. She received a spinal anesthetic with chloroprocaine, intravenous sedation, antiemetic prophylaxis, and an adductor canal catheter for continuous perineural analgesia. Warming measures, including a warm (20 °C) operating room, warm intravenous fluids, warm irrigating fluids, warm surgical prepping solution, forced-air warming blankets, and avoidance of a thigh tourniquet, helped prevent hypothermia in the patient. The patient's perioperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on the same day. She was followed up via a patient monitoring mobile application and advised to monitor herself for signs of CAD relapse. She had no concerns up to three months after surgery.
The perioperative management of patients with CAD is challenging, and multidisciplinary collaboration and coordination between the anesthesiologist, surgeon, hematologist, and nurses, as well as adequate intraoperative precautions and postoperative instructions and monitoring, are essential to ensuring safe surgery and optimal patient outcomes.
RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: La maladie des agglutinines froides (MAF) est une maladie auto-immune rare causée par des titres élevés d’auto-anticorps réagissant au froid qui provoquent l’agglutination des globules rouges et l’hémolyse ultérieure à basse température. Les traumatismes, la chirurgie et l’infection/inflammation exacerbent la MAF. Ce compte rendu décrit la prise en charge périopératoire réussie d’une patiente atteinte de MAF qui a bénéficié d’une arthroplastie totale du genou (ATG) en ambulatoire. CARACTéRISTIQUES CLINIQUES: Une femme de 70 ans a reçu un diagnostic de MAF en 2016 avec des symptômes de douleur et de pâleur au bout des doigts, d’engourdissement et de décoloration bleuâtre de la langue, et d’essoufflement. Elle a été traitée avec de l’acide folique, du rituximab et de la bendamustine. Après être demeurée asymptomatique pendant 4 ans et à la suite d’une consultation en hématologie, elle devait bénéficier d’une ATG. Elle a reçu une anesthésie rachidienne à base de chloroprocaïne, une sédation intraveineuse, une prophylaxie antiémétique et un cathéter du canal adducteur pour l’analgésie périneurale continue. Des mesures de réchauffement, y compris une salle d’opération chaude (20 °C), des liquides intraveineux chauds, des liquides d’irrigation chauds, une solution de préparation chirurgicale chauffée, des couvertures chauffantes à air pulsé et l’évitement d’un garrot à la cuisse, ont aidé à prévenir l’hypothermie chez la patiente. L’évolution périopératoire de la patiente s’est déroulée sans incident, et elle a reçu son congé le même jour. Elle a été suivie au moyen d’une application mobile de monitorage des patients et on lui a conseillé de s’auto-surveiller pour détecter tout signe de rechute de la MAF. Elle n’a eu aucune complication jusqu’à trois mois après l’opération. CONCLUSION: La prise en charge périopératoire des personnes atteintes de MAF est difficile, et la collaboration et la coordination multidisciplinaires entre les équipes d’anesthésie, de chirurgie, d’hématologie et le personnel infirmier, ainsi que des précautions peropératoires adéquates et des instructions et un suivi postopératoires, sont essentiels pour assurer une chirurgie sécuritaire et des devenirs optimaux pour les patients et patientes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40346430/

Our cohort study included 154 subjects aged 18 years and older undergoing CABG, enrolled in Italy, from April 2017 to January 2020. Data were prospectively collected from pre-anaesthesia induction to hospital discharge. Clustering was performed using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) on 23 variables and hierarchical clustering, including pre- and post-anaesthesia autonomic function indices and demographic and clinical data. Two distinct clusters were identified: 'higher risk-responsive group' and 'lower risk-responsive group'. The higher risk-responsive group cluster consisted of older patients with higher co-morbidity rates and worse autonomic function. Validation of clusters through multiple correspondence analysis and Poisson regression demonstrated significant differences in post-operative outcomes. Patients in the lower risk-responsive group cluster had fewer complications (IRR = 0.441, P = 0.004). The analysis indicated that intensive care unit (ICU) stay duration and the power of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) series in low-frequency band derived in the post-anaesthesia phase were significant predictors of complications above and beyond the expected contributions of age and comorbidities, with longer ICU stays and lower low-frequency power of SAP post-anaesthesia induction being associated with higher complication rates.
Integrating autonomic function measures and demographic and clinical data could enhance patient monitoring and intervention, improving outcomes if included in future risk stratification tools and early warning score systems.

The degree of neonatal activity is associated with under and over-sedation and may also indicate the onset of disease. Activity may also cause motion noise on physiological signals leading to false readings of important parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate or oxygen saturation or, in extreme cases, a failure to calculate the parameter at all. Here we report on a novel neonatal activity monitoring technology we have developed using a Random Forest machine learning algorithm trained on features extracted from a depth video stream from a commercially available depth sensing camera.
A cohort of twenty neonates took part in the study where depth information was acquired from various camera locations above and to the side of each neonate. Depth data were processed to provide features indicating changes corresponding to the activity of the neonate and then input into a Random Forest model which was trained and tested using a leave-one-out cross validation paradigm.
Applying the thresholds found in training the Random Forest model during testing with leave-one-out cross validation, the mean (standard deviation) of the sensitivity and specificity of the optimal points and the corresponding area under the receiver operator curve (ROC-AUC) were 92.0% (8.8%), 93.2% (11.1%) and 97.7% (2.5%) respectively.

However, in practice, sedation often becomes unavoidable, particularly for younger children or those with anxiety, to ensure motion-free, high-quality imaging. This narrative review explores the current practices and proposes strategies to enhance safety in pediatric MRI examinations.
We identified and analyzed 247 studies addressing various aspects of pediatric MRI safety, including sedation protocols, patient monitoring, and team-based management approaches.
Safe sedation requires careful drug selection tailored to individual needs, continuous monitoring, and robust emergency preparedness. While efforts are underway to minimize sedation, safer drug protocols and improved monitoring technologies remain essential. Assembling dedicated MRI teams trained in both technical and non-technical skills-such as situational awareness, communication, and teamwork-supports these strategies. Structured team briefings covering monitoring procedures, emergency scenarios, response protocols, and specific resuscitation roles are also critical. Developing a strong organizational culture that promotes patient safety and continuous learning from incident reports helps ensure ongoing improvements.
Achieving safe pediatric MRI examinations requires balancing the need for sedation with the goal of minimizing its use. Strengthening collaboration, refining sedation protocols, and implementing advanced safety monitoring systems are essential steps. Further advancements in imaging technologies are also necessary to reliably obtain high-quality scans without sedation, reducing risks and improving patient outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39729739/

Complications of laparoscopy, particularly perceptible as disorders of the physiology of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems, are caused by the specific technical conditions required for this type of operation. To facilitate surgical access and to clarify the surgical field, it is necessary to create a splenic emphysema, consisting of filling the peritoneal cavity with carbon dioxide (CO₂). This results in an increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and increased diffusion of CO₂ into the blood, causing a state of hypercarbia. The impact of these disturbances is of great importance in the pathological functioning of the above-mentioned organ systems. The anesthetist, in addition to the need to induce a state of general anesthesia, must be aware of and understand the pathological impact of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and hypercarbia to adjust patient monitoring accordingly and implement appropriate treatment targeting the specific complications occurring during laparoscopy. Complications and contraindications important from the anesthetist's point of view are also described.

We aimed to evaluate whether avatar-based patient monitoring, which presents vital signs in the form of changing colors, shapes and motion, improves remote vital sign recognition compared to conventional monitoring. We conducted a prospective, single-center, computer-based simulation study to evaluate how anesthesia providers recognize vital signs when using the Philips Visual Patient Avatar at different viewing distances (8 and 16 m) compared to conventional monitoring. The primary outcome was the total number of correctly identified vital signs which were compared for the two distances and the two devices using mixed Poisson regression. We analyzed data from 28 anesthesia providers who participated in 112 simulations. The correct recognition rate using the Visual Patient Avatar compared to conventional monitoring at 8 m was increased by 74% (rate ratio 1.74, 95% CI, 1.42 to 2.14, p < 0.001) and by 51% at 16-meter viewing distance (rate ratio 1.51, 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.87, p < 0.001). We observed scenario-specific superior performance for six vital signs at 8 m. The results provide empirical evidence that avatar-based monitoring can significantly improve the perception of vital signs when using distant vision.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39546214/

Validation of a first conceptual demonstrator and highlight of strengths and weaknesses.
The system includes relevant medical devices, a central anesthesia workstation (AN-WS), and a remote supervision workstation (SV-WS) and the concept uses the interoperability standard ISO/IEEE 11073 SDC. The validation method involves a human patient simulator, and the system is tested in an intervention study with 16 resident anesthetists supervised by a senior anesthetist.
This study presents a novel tele-supervision system that enables remote patient monitoring and communication between anesthesia providers and supervisors. It is composed of connected medical devices via SDC, a central AN-WS and a mobile remote SV-WS. The system is designed to handle multiple ORs and route the data to a single SV-WS. It enables audio/video connections and text chatting between the workstations and offers the supervisor to switch between cameras in the OR. Through a validation study the feasibility and usefulness of the system was assessed.
Validation results highlighted, that such system might not replace physically present supervisors but is able to provide supervision for scenarios where supervision is currently not available or only under adverse circumstances.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39444314/
39420396,Clinical investigation into risk factors for delirium post-cardiac surgery and its implications for nursing intervention guided by behavior change theory.,Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,2024,"Zhao Y, Guo S, Wang Z, Dong Y, Wei W, Su Z","This study explores the factors contributing to the occurrence of delirium following cardiac surgery and devises nursing strategies rooted in behavior change theory.
A cohort of 320 cardiac surgery patients was selected, categorized into two groups: 93 cases where postoperative delirium (POD) was anticipated, and 227 cases where it was not. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors of POD were scrutinized using single-factor analysis, while binary logistic regression analysis was employed to pinpoint risk factors.
Among the 320 patients, 93 displayed POD symptoms post-surgery, yielding an incidence of 29.06%. Preoperative univariate analysis disclosed significant differences in gender, age, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes (P < 0.05). Intraoperatively, significant differences were noted in the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) anesthesia grade (II, III, and IV), surgery time, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, and aortic occlusion duration (P < 0.05). Post-surgery, significant differences were observed in the duration of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation time, and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (P < 0.05). Multivariate Logistic regression identified surgery time (OR = 2.334, P < 0.001), ICU admission duration (OR = 1.457, P < 0.001), mechanical ventilation time (OR = 1.235, P = 0.004), and VAS scores (OR = 2.986, P < 0.001) as independent risk factors for POD. ROC curve analysis indicated higher sensitivity and specificity in predicting POD with surgery time, ICU stay duration, mechanical ventilation time, and VAS scores.
Irrespective of the surgical intervention type, surgery time, ICU stay duration, mechanical ventilation time, and VAS scores are recognized as risk factors for POD in cardiac surgery patients. Hence, continuous patient monitoring and early intervention tailored to specific risk factors are essential in clinical practice to mitigate POD incidence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39420396/

Implementation of best practices contained in this manuscript can significantly reduce medication errors and associated patient harm.
Cases of medication errors involving unintended intrathecal administration of tranexamic acid highlight the need to improve medication safety in peripartum patients and obstetric anesthesia.
In obstetric anesthesia, medication errors can include wrong medication, dose, route, time, patient, or infusion setting. These errors are often underreported, have the potential to be catastrophic, and most can be prevented. Implementation of various types of best practice cost effective mitigation strategies include recommendations to improve drug labeling, optimize storage, determine correct medication prior to administration, use non-Luer epidural and intravenous connection ports, follow patient monitoring guidelines, use smart pumps and protocols for all infusions, disseminate medication safety educational material, and optimize staffing models.

Armenia, a middle-income country in the Caucasus region, contended with the pandemic and a concurrent war, resulting in significant demand on its already strained health care infrastructure. The COVID@home program was a multi-institution, international collaboration to address critical hospital bed shortages by implementing a home-based oxygen therapy and remote monitoring program.
The objective of this study was to describe the program protocol and clinical outcomes of implementing an early discharge program in Armenia through a collaboration of partner institutions, which can inform the future implementation of COVID-19 remote home monitoring programs, particularly in LMICs or low-resource settings.
Seven hospitals in Yerevan participated in the COVID@home program. A web app based on OpenMRS was developed to facilitate data capture and care coordination. Patients meeting eligibility criteria were enrolled during hospitalization and monitored daily while on oxygen at home. Program evaluation relied on data extraction from (1) eligibility and enrollment forms, (2) daily monitoring forms, and (3) discharge forms.
Over 11 months, 439 patients were screened, and 221 patients were managed and discharged. Around 94% (n=208) of participants safely discontinued oxygen therapy at home, with a median home monitoring duration of 26 (IQR 15-45 days; mean 32.33, SD 25.29) days. Women (median 28.5, mean 35.25 days) had similar length of stay to men (median 26, mean 32.21 days; P=.75). Despite challenges in data collection and entry, the program demonstrated feasibility and safety, with a mortality rate below 1% and low re-admission rate. Opportunities for operational and data quality improvements were identified.
This study contributes practical evidence on the implementation and outcomes of a remote monitoring program in Armenia, offering insights into managing patients with COVID-19 in resource-constrained settings. The COVID@home program's success provides a model for remote patient care, potentially alleviating strain on health care resources in LMICs. Policymakers can draw from these findings to inform the development of adaptable health care solutions during public health crises, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches in resource-limited environments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39348686/

The CONOX (Fresenius Kabi) calculates two indices, the qCON (hypnotic level) and the qNOX (nociception). The CONOX also calculates indices for electromyographic (EMG) activity and EEG burst suppression (BSR). Because all EEG parameters seem to influence each other, our goal was a detailed description of parameter relationships.
We used qCON, qNOX, EMG, and BSR information from 14 patients receiving propofol anesthesia. We described index relationships with linear models, heat maps, and box plot representations. We also evaluated associations between qCON/qNOX and propofol/remifentanil effect site concentrations (ceP/ceR).
qNOX and qCON (qCON = 0.79*qNOX + 5.8; p < 0.001; R
We could describe relationships between qCON, qNOX, EMG, BSR, ceP, and ceR, which may help the anaesthesiologist better interpret the information provided. One major finding is the dependence of qCON > 80 on EMG activity. This may limit the possibility of detecting wakefulness in the absence of EMG. Further, qNOX seems generally higher than qCON, but high opioid doses may lead to higher qCON than qNOX indices.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39266928/

However, a traditional PS limits the ability of new users to simultaneously listen to heart and lung sounds alongside experienced practitioners, hindering their learning and development. Bluetooth speaker systems allow for multiple providers but amplify all noise. An artificial intelligence (AI) PS has the potential to selectively reduce ambient noise, allowing multiple providers to monitor concurrently and provides a visual representation of the sound waves. The study looks at the benefits of AI PS in teaching in the dental setting.
A questionnaire was created to compare the new AI PS to a conventional PS during intravenous moderate sedation in a dental clinic setting.
Sixteen individuals involved in sedations (four dental attendings, seven dental residents, and five dental assistants), were polled with a 100% response rate. 75% of participants agreed that clarity was improved using the AI PS and 81.25% of participants agreed that breath sounds and loudness were improved using the AI PS. 93.75% reported the AI PS was beneficial in allowing attendees to concurrently monitor a sedation case alongside dental residents. 100% of assistants reported that the AI PS benefited from their participation in sedation cases.
As technology advances, it is important that we as providers continue to evolve and consider implementing AI to improve our ability to monitor patients and enhance educational experiences for dental resident trainees.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39175148/

The aim of this study was to assess patients' knowledge about hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and perceptions and satisfaction of the RPM program.
Descriptive analysis of survey responses of patients with PPHTN enrolled into the RPM program for 6 weeks after delivery between October 2021 and April 2022. Surveys were automatically administered at 1-, 3-, and 6-week postpartum. Responses were further compared between Black and non-Black patient-reported race.

This study assesses the face, content, and construct validity of the ViGaTu (Virtual Gastro Tutor) immersive virtual reality (VR) simulator in teaching these skills.
71 nurses and physicians were invited to take part in VR training. The participants experienced an immersive VR simulation of an endoscopy procedure, including setting up the endoscopic devices, checking sign-in and team time-out forms, placing monitoring devices, and performing sedation. The actions performed by the participants and their timing were continuously recorded. Face and content validity, as well as the System Usability Scale (SUS), were then assessed.
43 physicians and 28 nurses from 43 centers took a mean of 27.8 min (standard deviation ± 14.42 min) to complete the simulation. Seventy-five percent of the items for assessing face validity were rated as realistic, and 60% of items assessing content validity and usefulness of the simulation for different learning goals were rated as useful by the participants (four out of five on a Likert scale). The SUS score was 70, demonstrating a high degree of usability.

38579308,Palliative sedation - revised recommendations.,Swiss medical weekly,2024,"Beauverd M, Mazzoli M, Pralong J, Tomczyk M, Eychmüller S, Gaertner J","Palliative sedation is defined as the monitored use of medications intended to induce a state of decreased or absent awareness (unconsciousness) to relieve the burden of otherwise intractable suffering in a manner ethically acceptable to the patient, their family, and healthcare providers. In Switzerland, the prevalence of continuous deep sedation until death increased from 4.7% in 2001 to 17.5% of all deceased in 2013, depending on the research method used and on regional variations. Yet, these numbers may be overestimated due to a lack of understanding of the term ""continuous deep sedation"" by for example respondents of the questionnaire-based study. Inadequately trained and inexperienced healthcare professionals may incorrectly or inappropriately perform palliative sedation due to uncertainties regarding its definitions and practice. Therefore, the expert members of the Bigorio group and the authors of this manuscript believe that national recommendations should be published and made available to healthcare professionals to provide practical, terminological, and ethical guidance. The Bigorio group is the working group of the Swiss Palliative Care Society whose task is to publish clinical recommendations at a national level in Switzerland. These recommendations aim to provide guidance on the most critical questions and issues related to palliative sedation. The Swiss Society of Palliative Care (palliative.ch) mandated a writing board comprising four clinical experts (three physicians and one ethicist) and two national academic experts to revise the 2005 Bigorio guidelines. A first draft was created based on a narrative literature review, which was internally reviewed by five academic institutions (Lausanne, Geneva, Bern, Zürich, and Basel) and the heads of all working groups of the Swiss Society of Palliative Care before finalising the guidelines. The following themes are discussed regarding palliative sedation: (a) definitions and clinical aspects, (b) the decision-making process, (c) communication with patients and families, (d) patient monitoring, (e) pharmacological approaches, and (f) ethical and controversial issues. Palliative sedation must be practised with clinical and ethical accuracy and competence to avoid harm and ethically questionable use.

We propose an outpatient daycase method of delivering Rezūm™ under local anaesthetic without sedation, using a prostatic local anaesthetic block and cold local anaesthetic gel instillation into the urethra.
Preliminary results of our first thirteen patients demonstrate the feasibility of this new technique, with a mean pain score of 2.1 out of 10 on a visual analogue scale, a successful trial without catheter in all 13 patients (one patient voided successfully on second trial), a reduction in mean International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) from 20.6 to 5.4, and improvement in maximum flow from 8.8 ml/s to 14.4 ml/s. The complications were minor (Clavien-Dindo less than III) and included a UTI, minor bleeding not requiring admission, and retrograde ejaculation.

In Norway, 2022, a prerequisite to nurse anesthesia education programs of at least two years of clinical nursing experience prior to entry, was removed. The consequences of removing the prerequisite of clinical nursing experience prior to entering the nurse anesthetist education program on academic progression or on students' qualifications after completion of the program remain unexplored. Hence, the purpose of the current study was to explore nurse anesthetist students' experiences of the impact their previous clinical nursing experience had on their academic progression.
A qualitative design with semi-structured individual interviews was used. The sample consisted of 12 nurse anesthetist students at the end of the education program. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis in-line with recommendations from Braun & Clarke.
Two main themes with in total six subthemes were identified, namely 1) Experience develops non-technical skills, with subthemes (a) feeling secure in task management, (b) recognizing different situations, (c) understanding my role in teamwork, and 2) Integration of non-technical and technical skills, with subthemes (a) possessing procedural competence, (b) taking responsibility in medication administration, and (c) including a patient-centred approach. Previous clinical experience as a nurse prior to entry to a NA education program had provided a basis of non-technical and technical competencies, that supported further learning and development of advanced level competencies that are needed for NAs.
Non-technical and technical nursing competence represented a solid base for achievement of anesthesia competence within the same areas, also ensuring patient-centred practice.

Patient monitoring started out as a manually performed, intermittent, and qualitative assessment of the patient's general well-being in the operating room. In its evolution, patient monitoring development has responded to the clinical need, for example, when critical incident studies in the 1980s found that many anesthesia adverse events could be prevented by improved monitoring, especially respiratory monitoring. It also facilitated and perhaps even enabled increasingly complex surgeries in increasingly higher-risk patients. For example, it would be very challenging to perform and provide anesthesia care during some of the very complex cardiovascular surgeries that are almost routine today without being able to simultaneously and reliably monitor multiple pressures in a variety of places in the circulatory system. Of course, anesthesia patient monitoring itself is enabled by technological developments in the world outside of the operating room. Throughout its history, anesthesia patient monitoring has taken advantage of advancements in material science (when nonthrombogenic polymers allowed the design of intravascular catheters, for example), in electronics and transducers, in computers, in displays, in information technology, and so forth. Slower product life cycles in medical devices mean that by carefully observing technologies such as consumer electronics, including user interfaces, it is possible to peek ahead and estimate with confidence the foundational technologies that will be used by patient monitors in the near future. Just as the discipline of anesthesiology has, the patient monitoring that accompanies it has come a long way from its beginnings in the mid-19th century. Extrapolating from careful observations of the prevailing trends that have shaped anesthesia patient monitoring historically, patient monitoring in the future will use noncontact technologies, will predict the trajectory of a patient's vital signs, will add regional vital signs to the current systemic ones, and will facilitate directed and supervised anesthesia care over the broader scope that anesthesia will be responsible for.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38215707/

In daily clinical practice, the EEG is recorded from the forehead and available neuromonitoring systems translate the EEG information into an index inversely correlating with the anesthetic level. Electrode placement on the forehead can lead to an influence of electromyographic (EMG) activity on the recorded signal in patients without neuromuscular blockade (NMB). A separation of EEG and EMG in the clinical setting is difficult because both signals share an overlapping frequency range. Previous research showed that indices decreased when EMG was absent in awake volunteers with NMB. Here, we investigated to what extent the indices changed, when EEG recorded during surgery with NMB agents was superimposed with EMG.
We recorded EMG from the flexor muscles of the forearm of 18 healthy volunteers with a CONOX monitor during different activity settings, that is, during contraction using a grip strengthener and during active diversion (relaxed arm). Both the forehead and forearm muscles are striated muscles. The recorded EMG was normalized by z -scoring and added to the EEG in different amplification steps. The EEG was recorded during anesthesia with NMB. We replayed these combined EEG and EMG signals to different neuromonitoring systems, that is, bispectral index (BIS), CONOX with qCON and qNOX, and entropy module with state entropy (SE) and response entropy (RE). We used the Friedman test and a Tukey-Kramer post hoc correction for statistical analysis.
The indices of all neuromonitoring systems significantly increased when the EEG was superimposed with the contraction EMG and with high EMG amplitudes, the monitors returned invalid values, representative of artifact contamination. When replaying the EEG being superimposed with ""relaxed"" EMG, the qCON and BIS showed significant increases, but not SE and RE. For SE and RE, we observed an increased number of invalid values.
With our approach, we could show that EMG activity during contraction and resting state can influence the neuromonitoring systems. This knowledge may help to improve EEG-based patient monitoring in the future and help the anesthesiologist to use the neuromonitoring systems with more knowledge regarding their function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37756246/

Coordination of SATs and SBTs is difficult with substantial implementation barriers due to difficult-to-execute sequencing between nurses and respiratory therapists. Telehealth-enabled remote care has the potential to overcome these barriers and improve coordinated SAT and SBT adherence by enabling proactive high-risk patient monitoring, surveillance, and real-time assistance to frontline ICU teams.
The telehealth-enabled, real-time audit and feedback for clinician adherence (TEACH) study will determine whether adding a telehealth augmented real-time audit and feedback to a usual supervisor-led audit and feedback intervention will yield higher coordinated SAT and SBT adherence and more ventilator-free days in mechanically ventilated patients than a usual supervisor-led audit and feedback intervention alone in a type II hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster-randomized clinical trial in 12 Intermountain Health hospitals with 15 ICUs. In the active comparator control group (six hospitals), the only intervention is the usual supervisor-led audit and feedback implementation. The telehealth-enabled support (TEACH) intervention in six hospitals adds real-time identification of patients eligible for a coordinated SAT and SBT and consultative input from telehealth respiratory therapists, nurses, and physicians to the bedside clinicians to promote adherence including real-time assistance with execution. All intubated and mechanically ventilated patients ≥ 16 years of age are eligible for enrollment except for patients who die on the day of intubation or have preexisting brain death. Based on preliminary power analyses, we plan a 36-month intervention period that includes a 90-day run-in period. Estimated enrollment in the final analysis is up to 9900 mechanically ventilated patients over 33 months.
The TEACH study will enhance implementation science by providing insight into how a telehealth intervention augmenting a usual audit and feedback implementation may improve adherence to coordinated SAT and SBT and increase ventilator-free days.

Clinically, electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is a well-established method to guide GA. There are no established methods available for monitoring EEG in mice (Mus musculus) during surgery. In this study, a minimally invasive rodent intraoperative EEG monitoring system was implemented using subdermal needle electrodes and a modified EEG-based commercial patient monitor. EEG recordings were acquired at three different isoflurane concentrations revealing that surgical concentrations of isoflurane anesthesia predominantly contained burst suppression patterns in mice. EEG suppression ratios and suppression durations showed strong positive correlations with the isoflurane concentrations. The electroencephalographic indices provided by the monitor did not support online monitoring of the anesthetic status. The online available suppression duration in the raw EEG signals during isoflurane anesthesia is a straight forward and reliable marker to assure safe, adequate and reproducible anesthesia protocols.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37462861/

As many older adults have low levels of physical activity and technology use, this area needs further exploration. We evaluated the feasibility of daily step count monitoring and the association between step counts and treatment-emergent symptoms.
Adults aged 65+ starting treatment (chemotherapy, enzalutamide/abiraterone, or radium-223) for metastatic prostate cancer were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Participants reported step counts (measured via smartphone) and symptoms (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale) daily for one treatment cycle (i.e., 3-4 weeks). Embedded semi-structured interviews were performed upon completion of the study. The feasibility of daily monitoring was evaluated with descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. The predictive validity of a decline in daily steps (compared to pre-treatment baseline) for the emergence of symptoms was examined using sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). Associations between a 15% decline in steps and the emergence of moderate (4-6/10) to severe (7-10/10) symptoms and pain in the next 24 h were assessed using logistic regression.
Of 90 participants, 47 engaged in step count monitoring (median age = 75, range = 65-88; 52.2% participation rate). Daily physical activity monitoring was found to be feasible (94% retention rate; 90.5% median response rate) with multiple patient-reported benefits including increased self-awareness and motivation to engage in physical activity. During the first treatment cycle, instances of a 15% decline in steps were common (n = 37, 78.7%), as was the emergence of moderate to severe symptoms overall (n = 40, 85.1%) and pain (n = 26, 55.3%). The predictive validity of a 15% decline in steps on the emergence of moderate to severe symptoms was good (sensitivity = 81.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 68.7-95.0; PPV = 73.0%, 95% CI = 58.7-87.3), although the PPV for pain was poor (sensitivity = 77.8%, 95% CI = 58.6-97.0; PPV = 37.8%, 95% CI = 22.2-53.5). In the regression models, changes in daily physical activity were not associated with symptoms or pain.
Changes in physical activity had modest ability to predict moderate to severe symptoms overall. Although participation was suboptimal, daily activity monitoring in older adults with cancer appears feasible and may have other uses such as improving physical activity levels. Further studies are warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37421787/

Because data density increases with the number of parameters captured by patient-monitoring devices, its interpretation has become more challenging. Therefore, it is necessary to support clinicians in managing information overload while improving their awareness and understanding about the patient's health status. Patient monitoring has almost exclusively operated on the single-sensor-single-indicator principle-a technology-centered way of presenting data in which specific parameters are measured and displayed individually as separate numbers and waves. An alternative is user-centered medical visualization technology, which integrates multiple pieces of information (e.g., vital signs), derived from multiple sensors into a single indicator-an avatar-based visualization-that is a meaningful representation of the real-world situation. Data are presented as changing shapes, colors, and animation frequencies, which can be perceived, integrated, and interpreted much more efficiently than other formats (e.g., numbers). The beneficial effects of these technologies have been confirmed in computer-based simulation studies; visualization technologies improved clinicians' situation awareness by helping them effectively perceive and verbalize the underlying medical issue, while improving diagnostic confidence and reducing workload. This review presents an overview of the scientific results and the evidence for the validity of these technologies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37381008/

It is therefore important to avoid any factors causing delirium as far as possible. Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring can be used during anesthesia to individually adjust dosages of hypnotically acting drugs. It is necessary to gain knowledge about the relationship between intraoperative EEG and postoperative delirium in children.
In a dataset comprising 89 children (53 male, 36 female; median age: 0.99 (interquartile range: 0.51, 4.89) years) undergoing cardiac surgery involving use of a heart-lung machine, relationships between depth of anesthesia as measured by EEG (EEG index: Narcotrend Index (NI)), sevoflurane dosage, and body temperature were analyzed. A Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAP-D) score ≥ 9 indicated delirium.
The EEG could be used in patients of all age groups for patient monitoring during anesthesia. In the context of induced hypothermia, EEG monitoring supported individually adjusted sevoflurane dosing. The NI was significantly correlated with the body temperature; decreasing temperature was accompanied by a decreasing NI. A CAP-D score ≥ 9 was documented in 61 patients (68.5%); 28 patients (31.5%) had a CAP-D < 9. Delirious patients with an intubation time ≤ 24 h showed a moderate negative correlation between minimum NI (NI

High workload and information overload can impair situation awareness of staff, thus leading to loss of important information about patients' conditions. To facilitate mental processing of patient monitoring data, we developed the Visual-Patient-avatar Intensive Care Unit (ICU), a virtual patient model animated from vital signs and patient installation data. It incorporates user-centred design principles to foster situation awareness. This study investigated the avatar's effects on information transfer measured by performance, diagnostic confidence and perceived workload. This computer-based study compared Visual-Patient-avatar ICU and conventional monitor modality for the first time. We recruited 25 nurses and 25 physicians from five centres. The participants completed an equal number of scenarios in both modalities. Information transfer, as the primary outcome, was defined as correctly assessing vital signs and installations. Secondary outcomes included diagnostic confidence and perceived workload. For analysis, we used mixed models and matched odds ratios. Comparing 250 within-subject cases revealed that Visual-Patient-avatar ICU led to a higher rate of correctly assessed vital signs and installations [rate ratio (RR) 1.25; 95% CI 1.19-1.31; P < 0.001], strengthened diagnostic confidence [odds ratio (OR) 3.32; 95% CI 2.15-5.11, P < 0.001] and lowered perceived workload (coefficient - 7.62; 95% CI - 9.17 to - 6.07; P < 0.001) than conventional modality.

The authors investigated the association of patient characteristics, surgical procedure, and perioperative anesthetic course with postoperative opioid consumption and pain 3 months postsurgery. The authors hypothesized that patient characteristics and intraoperative factors predict opioid consumption and pain 3 months postsurgery.
Eleven U.S. and one European institution enrolled patients scheduled for spine, open thoracic, knee, hip, or abdominal surgery, or mastectomy, in this multicenter, prospective observational study. Preoperative and postoperative data were collected using patient surveys and electronic medical records. Intraoperative data were collected from the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group database. The association between postoperative opioid consumption and surgical site pain at 3 months, elicited from a telephone survey conducted at 3 months postoperatively, and demographics, psychosocial scores, pain scores, pain management, and case characteristics, was analyzed.
Between September and October 2017, 3,505 surgical procedures met inclusion criteria. A total of 1,093 cases were included; 413 patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 680 (64%) for outcome analysis. Preoperatively, 135 (20%) patients were taking opioids. Three months postsurgery, 96 (14%) patients were taking opioids, including 23 patients (4%) who had not taken opioids preoperatively. A total of 177 patients (27%) reported surgical site pain, including 45 (13%) patients who had not reported pain preoperatively. The adjusted odds ratio for 3-month opioid use was 18.6 (credible interval, 10.3 to 34.5) for patients who had taken opioids preoperatively.

However, many low resource countries do not have adequate numbers of pulse oximeters available or healthcare workers trained in their use. Lifebox, a nonprofit organization focused on improving anesthetic and surgical safety, has procured and distributed pulse oximeters and relevant educational training in over 100 countries. We aimed to understand qualitatively how pulse oximetry provision and training affected a group of Zambian non-physician anesthetists' perioperative care and what, if any, capacity gaps remain.
We identified and approached non-physician anesthetists (NPAPs) in Zambia who attended a 2019 Lifebox pulse oximetry training course to participate in a semi-structured interview. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Codes were iteratively derived; the codebook was tested for inter-rater reliability (pooled kappa > 0.70). Team-based thematic analysis identified emergent themes on pulse oximetry training and perioperative patient care.
Ten of the 35 attendees were interviewed. Two themes emerged concerning pulse oximetry provision and training in discussion with non-physician anesthetists about their experience after training: (1) Impact on Non-Physician Anesthetists and the Healthcare Team and (2) Impact on Perioperative Patient Monitoring. These broad themes were further explored through subthemes. Increased knowledge brought confidence in monitoring and facilitated quick interventions. NPAPs reported improved preoperative assessments and reaffirmed the necessity of having pulse oximetry intraoperatively. However, lack of device availability led to case delays or cancellations. A portable device travelling with the patient to the recovery ward was noted as a major improvement in postoperative care. Pulse oximeters also improved communication between nurses and NPAPs, giving NPAPs confidence in the recovery process. However, this was not always possible, as lack of pulse oximeters and ward staff unfamiliarity with oximetry was commonly reported. NPAPs expressed that wider pulse oximetry availability and training would be beneficial.
Among a cohort of non-physician anesthetists in Zambia, the provision of pulse oximeters and training was perceived to improve patient care throughout the perioperative timeline. However, capacity and resource gaps remain in their practice settings, especially during transfers of care. NPAPs identified a number of areas where patient care and safety could be improved, including expanding access to pulse oximetry training and provision to ward and nursing staff to ensure the entire healthcare team is aware of the benefits and importance of its use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36419106/

We searched the PubMed Medline and Igaku Chuo Zasshi (ICHUSHI) databases from 1980 to 2022 for papers on sedatives used during bronchoscopy, especially opioids (fentanyl and pethidine) and midazolam. The keywords were ""bronchoscopy"" and ""sedation"" (""kikanshikyo"" and ""chinsei"", respectively, in Japanese). The results showed that midazolam was the preferred sedation agent during flexible bronchoscopy; with midazolam sedation is rapid, and the drug is associated with anterograde amnesia and decreased discomfort. A combination of an opioid (fentanyl or pethidine) and midazolam improved the patient tolerance and willingness to undergo a repeat procedure and also improved the working conditions for the physician. The British Thoracic Society guideline of 2013 suggested that a combination of an opioid (fentanyl or alfentanil) and midazolam should be considered to improve bronchoscopic tolerance. The American College of Chest Physicians Consensus Statement of 2011 suggested that fentanyl should be preferred; the onset of action and peak effect are rapid, and the effects are of relatively short duration. Emphasis has been placed on safety aspects, such as patient monitoring, the precautions that should be taken in patients with certain conditions, prevention and management of complications, adequate staffing, and optimal sedation and disinfection. In conclusion a combined opioid (fentanyl or pethidine) and midazolam sedation is optimal for diagnostic and therapeutic flexible bronchoscopy in Japanese patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36220691/

Eye-tracking is a suitable tool to gain insight into the distribution of visual attention of healthcare professionals with patient monitors, which may facilitate their further development.
This prospective, exploratory, high-fidelity simulation study compared anesthesia personnel's visual attention (fixation count and dwell-time) to 15 areas of interest on the patient monitor during non-critical and critical anesthesia situations. Furthermore, we examined the extent to which participants' experience influenced visual attention and which vital signs displayed on the patient monitor received the most visual attention. We used mixed zero-inflated Poisson regression and mixed linear models to analyze the data.
Analyzing 23 ten-minute scenarios, we found significantly more fixations to the areas of interest on the patient monitor during critical than non-critical situations (rate ratio of 1.45; 95% CI 1.33 to 1.59; p < 0.001). However, the dwell-time on the areas of interest did not significantly differ between the non-critical and critical situations (coefficient of - 1.667; 95% CI - 4.549 to 1.229; p = 0.27). The professional experience did not significantly influence the visual attention (fixation: rate ratio of 0.88; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.43; p = 0.61 and dwell-time: coefficient of 0.889; 95% CI - 1.465 to 3.229; p = 0.27). Over all situations, anesthesia personnel paid the most attention to the vital signs blood pressure (fixation: mean [SD] of 108 [74.83]; dwell-time: mean [SD] of 27 [15.90] seconds), end-expiratory carbon dioxide (fixation: mean [SD] of 59 [47.39]; dwell-time: mean [SD] of 30 [21.51] seconds), and the electrocardiogram (fixation: mean [SD] of 58 [64.70]; dwell-time: mean [SD] of 15 [14.95] seconds).
Critical anesthesia situations increased anesthesia personnel's visual interaction with the patient monitor. Furthermore, we found that their visual attention focused mainly on a few vital signs. To assist clinicians in critical situations, manufacturers should optimize monitors to convey necessary information as easily and quickly as possible and optimize the visibility of less frequently observed but equally critical vital signs, especially when they are in an abnormal range.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35637450/

The pathophysiology of coronary dissection appears to be an outside-in mechanism, where the initiating event is not an intimal tear but rather the formation of an intramural hematoma, which compromises blood flow by reducing the arterial lumen. Considering this mechanism, it is clear to see how intracoronary imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography and intravascular ultrasound, are most accurate in the diagnosis. However, they carry a high rate of complications and are therefore generally avoided when the clinical scenario and angiographic appearance both support the diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection. The natural history of the disease is toward healing of the vessel wall and restoration of blood flow. Therefore, conservative medical management is the preferred approach unless there are high-risk factors such as hemodynamic instability, signs of ischemia and severe proximal or multivessel lesions, in which percutaneous or surgical revascularization should be considered. Perioperative evaluation of these patients must take into account several aspects of this disease. Most of these patients will be receiving single or dual antiplatelet therapy, so one must consider the timing of the event and the surgical hemorrhagic risk when deciding to stop these therapies. Extracoronary vascular disease also must be assessed because it can have an effect on patient monitoring and risk of postoperative complications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35618587/

Invasive arterial puncture and catheterization facilitate the grasp of real-time vital sign information of patients during surgery, which strengthens patient monitoring during surgery and improves safety. However, the traditional method of arterial puncture and cannulation through palpation of the radial artery is often prone to complications related to mechanical injury, such as hemorrhage, hematoma, and accidental perforation of the artery. Studies have shown that ultrasound-guided radial artery puncture and cannulation can shorten the puncture cannulation time, reduce the incidence of complications related to puncture cannulation, and improve the success rate of puncture cannulation. In order to verify it, this paper uses the experimental group and the control group to conduct comparative experiments and uses the neural network method to evaluate the effects of the two methods. As a more mature method of artificial intelligence, BP neural network is widely used in a wide range of applications and has the characteristics of strong generalization ability and fast convergence, so we choose it as the base model. The specific work of this paper is as follows: (1) in-depth study of the relevant theory of BP neural network (BPNN), focusing on the structure of BPNN and the working principle of algorithm; the problems to be solved in the clinical anesthesia effect evaluation have laid a theoretical foundation for the establishment of an improved BPNN evaluation model in the following chapters.

Metrics that can guide care on the labor and delivery (L&D) floor may be related to team structure (obstetric, multidisciplinary, anesthetic), processes (patient monitoring, team effects), and outcomes (postpartum hemorrhage, venous thromboembolism). Multiple anesthetic quality metrics have been proposed, including the mode of anesthesia for cesarean delivery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34776100/

The Italian Lung Ultrasound Survey (ITALUS) was a nationwide online survey proposed to Italian anesthesiologists and intensive care physicians carried out after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It consisted of 27 questions, both quantitative and qualitative.
807 responded to the survey. The median previous LUS experience was 3 years (IQR 1.0-6.0). 473 (60.9 %) reported having attended at least one training course on LUS before the COVID-19 pandemic. 519 (73.9 %) reported knowing how to use the LUS score. 404 (52 %) reported being able to use LUS without any supervision. 479 (68.2 %) said that LUS influenced their clinical decision-making, mostly with respect to patient monitoring. During the pandemic, the median of patients daily evaluated with LUS increased 3-fold (p < 0.001), daily use of general LUS increased from 10.4 % to 28.9 % (p < 0.001), and the daily use of LUS score in particular increased from 1.6 % to 9.0 % (p < 0.001).
This survey showed that LUS was already extensively used during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic by anesthesiologists and intensive care physicians in Italy, and then its adoption increased further. Residency programs are already progressively implementing LUS teaching. However, 76.7 % of the sample did not undertake any LUS certification.

This was a retrospective study in peripartum women who required activation of the following codes during hospitalization between January 2014 and May 2018: ""Code 77 (C77)"" (obstetric emergency), ""Code Blue (CB)"" (cardiopulmonary compromise) or ""Code Omega (CO)"" (massive transfusion). Hospital database and health records were searched to identify and review cases. Data on code characteristics, resuscitative measures, and maternal and neonatal outcomes were collected.
A total of 147 codes were identified during the study period (C77, 110; CO, 25; CB 12), with an overall incidence of 1 per 203 deliveries (C77, 1:271 deliveries, CO, 1:1194 deliveries; CB, 1:2488 deliveries). Common indications for C77 were cord prolapse (33%) and fetal bradycardia (32%), and for CO and CB, postpartum hemorrhage (84%) and cardiac arrest (42%), respectively. Most codes (67%) occurred after hours. The median decision-to-delivery interval was 8 (interquartile range 5-15) minutes after C77. Emergency cesarean delivery was performed for 57% of obstetric emergencies, and general anesthesia was administered in 63% of cesarean deliveries. Maternal and neonatal mortality rates were 0.68% and 7%, respectively. Major maternal morbidity was seen in 33% of cases. Debrief was documented for 4% of codes.
Rapid response team activation was required more commonly in C77 than in CO or CB. Their response time and decision-to-delivery intervals were rapid. Mortality was low; however, one-third of parturients had major morbidities. We suggest closer patient monitoring, immediate availability of resources, and appropriate documentation and debriefing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34656770/
34543237,The Strength of Alpha Oscillations in the Electroencephalogram Differently Affects Algorithms Used for Anesthesia Monitoring.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2021,"Weyer C, Prötzl E, Kinateder T, Nowak F, Husemann C, Hautmann H, Kratzer S, Schneider G, Kreuzer M","Intraoperative patient monitoring using the electroencephalogram (EEG) can help to adequately adjust the anesthetic level. Therefore, the processed EEG (pEEG) provides the anesthesiologist with the estimated anesthesia level. The commonly used approaches track the changes from a fast- and a low-amplitude EEG during wakefulness to a slow- and a high-amplitude EEG under general anesthesia. However, besides these changes, another EEG feature, a strong oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz), develops in the frontal EEG. Strong alpha-band activity during general anesthesia seems to reflect an appropriate anesthetic level for certain anesthetics, but the way the common pEEG approaches react to changes in the alpha-band activity is not well explained. Hence, we investigated the impact of an artificial alpha-band modulation on pEEG approaches used in anesthesia research.
We performed our analyses based on 30 seconds of simulated sedation (n = 25) EEG, simulated anesthesia (n = 25) EEG, and EEG episodes from 20 patients extracted from a steady state that showed a clearly identifiable alpha peak in the density spectral array (DSA) and a state entropy (GE Healthcare) around 50, indicative of adequate anesthesia. From these traces, we isolated the alpha activity by band-pass filtering (8-12 Hz) and added this alpha activity to or subtracted it from the signals in a stepwise manner. For each of the original and modified signals, the following pEEG values were calculated: (1) spectral edge frequency (SEF95), (2) beta ratio, (3) spectral entropy (SpEntr), (4) approximate entropy (ApEn), and (5) permutation entropy (PeEn).
The pEEG approaches showed different reactions to the alpha-band modification that depended on the data set and the amplification step. The beta ratio and PeEn decreased with increasing alpha activity for all data sets, indicating a deepening of anesthesia. The other pEEG approaches behaved nonuniformly. SEF95, SpEntr, and ApEn decreased with increasing alpha for the simulated anesthesia data (arousal) but decreased for simulated sedation. For the patient EEG, ApEn indicated an arousal, and SEF95 and SpEntr showed a nonuniform change.
Changes in the alpha-band activity lead to different reactions for different pEEG approaches. Hence, the presence of strong oscillatory alpha activity that reflects an adequate level of anesthesia may be interpreted differently, by an either increasing (arousal) or decreasing (deepening) pEEG value. This could complicate anesthesia navigation and prevent the adjustment to an adequate, alpha-dominant anesthesia level, when titrating by the pEEG values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34543237/

This study was conducted in an explorative qualitative design. Purposive and snowball sampling approaches were used to recruit the study participants. Qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with anesthesiologists (n = 10) and a neurologist (n = 1). The qualitative data collected in this study were thematically analyzed using the interpretive description methodology to generate themes, subthemes, and patterns.
Three major themes emerged from the collected qualitative data with a total of 18 subthemes. The 3 themes were: 1) considerations/challenges while assessing patients, 2) anesthetic considerations, and 3) recovery considerations. Lack of epilepsy-specific assessment and anesthesia protocols, underuse of neurology referral services, and lack of neuromonitoring were identified.
Findings of this study highlighted the need to develop specific anesthesia protocols for patients with epilepsy. Anesthesiologists and planners of perioperative care should improve collection of patient information and assessment methods, ensure control over seizures, reduce triggers of seizures, and improve patient monitoring approaches. Findings of this study might be used to inform anesthesiologists and decision makers in professional groups, patient advocacy groups, and healthcare authorities to benchmark and improve anesthesia care and services offered to patients with epilepsy. More studies are still needed to quantitatively assess the quality of anesthesia care and services provided to patients with epilepsy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34492543/

In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to paediatric preoperative anxiety in China. A variety of strategies, including sedatives, parental presence, and audio-visual interventions, have been used to relieve paediatric preoperative anxiety, but there is no well-recognised procedure for paediatric preoperative sedation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate current paediatric preoperative sedation practices in tertiary children's hospitals in China.
All tertiary maternity and children's hospitals registered with the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China were invited to participate in an electronic survey, which included information on the preoperative sedation caseload, sites where preoperative sedation was performed, preoperative sedation methods used in different age groups, choice of sedatives, contraindications for premedication, staff structure for sedative administration and monitoring, and patient-monitoring practices.
All 81 hospitals participating in our study completed the survey, and 38 hospitals (46.9 %) provided their preoperative sedation protocols. Twenty-four hospitals performed fewer than 5,000 preoperative sedation cases annually, and 9 hospitals performed more than 10,000 cases annually. Preoperative sedation was performed in preoperative preparation areas, preoperative holding areas, and operation rooms in 47.4 %, 26.3 %, and 13.2 % of hospitals, respectively. Sedatives were the most used interventions for paediatric preoperative sedation in all age groups, and the most widely used sedatives were propofol (intravenous) and dexmedetomidine (intranasal). The most common contraindications were American Society of Anesthesiologists class ≥ 3, emergency operation, and airway infection within 2 weeks. Sedatives were administered mainly by anaesthesiologists (63.2 %), and children were monitored mainly by anaesthesiologists (44.7 %) and nurses (39.5 %) after administration. Pulse oximetry was the most widely used monitoring device.
Fewer than half of the tertiary maternity and children's hospitals in China provide paediatric preoperative sedation service, and the service practices vary widely. Further improvements are required to ensure the quality of paediatric preoperative sedation services and establish standard operating procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34372814/

Many people who knew Dr. Aoyagi, or knew of him and his invention, agreed to participate in this tribute to his work. The authors, from Japan and around the world, represent all aspects of the development of medical devices, including scientists and engineers, clinicians, academics, business people, and clinical practitioners.
While the idea of pulse oximetry originated in Japan, device development lagged in Japan due to a lack of business, clinical, and academic interest. Awareness of the importance of anesthesia safety in the US, due to academic foresight and media attention, in combination with excellence in technological innovation, led to widespread use of pulse oximetry around the world.

Advances in patient monitoring technology, utilization of Child Life specialists, and alternative staffing models are helping anesthesia providers meet the rising demand for coverage of pediatric nonoperating room anesthesia (NORA) cases. The Wake Up Safe and Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium registries are exploring outcome measures regarding the safety of pediatric anesthesia in off-site locations and have reported an increased risk for severe respiratory and cardiac adverse events when compared to OR anesthesia sites. Additionally, malpractice claims for NORA have a higher proportion of claims for death than claims in operating rooms.

Patients presenting for NORA procedures are also older and sicker than ever. Commensurate with the requirements of procedural medicine, anesthetic monitoring must meet the American Society of Anesthesiologists standards for basic monitoring.
There have been improvements in the required monitors that are used for intraoperative patient care. Some of these changes have been with new technologies and others have occurred with software refinements. In addition, specialized monitoring devises have also been introduced into NORA locations (depth of hypnosis, respiratory monitoring, point-of care ultrasound). These additions to the monitoring tools available to the anesthesiologist working in the NORA-environment push the boundaries of procedures which may be accomplished in this setting.
NORA procedures constitute a growing percentage of total administered anesthetics. There is no difference in the monitoring standard between that of an anesthetic administered in an operating room and a NORA location. Anesthesiologists in the NORA setting must have the same compendium of monitors available as do their colleagues working in the operating suite.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34010175/

Avatar-based patient monitoring may promote situation awareness in critical situations.
We conducted a prospective, randomised, high-fidelity simulation study powered for non-inferiority. We used video analysis to grade anaesthesia teams managing three 10 min emergency scenarios using three randomly assigned monitoring modalities: only conventional, only avatar, and split-screen showing both modalities side by side. The primary outcome was time to performance of critical tasks. Secondary outcomes were time to verbalisation of vital sign deviations and the correct cause of the emergency, perceived workload, and usability. We used mixed Cox and linear regression models adjusted for various potential confounders. The non-inferiority margin was 10%, or hazard ratio (HR) 0.9.
We analysed 52 teams performing 154 simulations. For performance of critical tasks during a scenario, split-screen was non-inferior to conventional (HR=1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.33; not significant in test for superiority); the result for avatar was inconclusive (HR=0.98; 95% CI, 0.83-1.15). Avatar was associated with a higher probability for verbalisation of the cause of the emergency (HR=1.78; 95% CI, 1.13-2.81; P=0.012). We found no evidence for a monitor effect on perceived workload. Perceived usability was lower for avatar (coefficient=-23.0; 95% CI, -27.2 to -18.8; P<0.0001) and split-screen (-6.7; 95% CI, -10.9 to -2.4; P=0.002) compared with conventional.
This study showed non-inferiority of split-screen compared with conventional monitoring for performance of critical tasks during anaesthesia crisis situations.

The effects of patient positioning on the accuracy of non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring with the ClearSight™ system (CS-BP; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine CA, USA) have not been studied extensively. Our research aim was to assess agreement levels between CS-BP measurements with traditional blood pressure monitoring techniques.
For this prospective self-controlled study, we included 20 consecutively treated adult patients undergoing elective shoulder surgery in the beach chair position. We performed Bland-Altman analyses to determine agreement levels between blood pressure values from CS-BP and standard non-invasive (NIBP) methods. Perioperative measurements were done in both the supine (as reference) and beach chair surgical positions. Additionally, we compared invasive blood pressure (IBP) measurements with both the non-invasive methods (CS-BP and NIBP) in a sub-group of patients (n = 10) who required arterial blood pressure monitoring.
We analyzed 229 data points (116 supine, 113 beach chair) from the entire cohort; per patient measurements were based on surgical length (range 3-9 supine, 2-10 beach chair). The mean difference (±SD; 95% limits of agreement) in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) between CS-BP and NIBP was - 0.9 (±11.0; - 24.0-22.2) in the beach chair position and - 4.9 mmHg (±11.8; - 28.0-18.2) when supine.

Some monitoring systems like the SEDLine Root allow export of the EEG to be used for retrospective analysis. We show that changes made to the SEDLine display during recording affected the recorded EEG. These changes can strongly impact retrospective analysis of EEG signals. Real-time changes of the feed speed in the SEDLine Root device display modifies the sampling rate of the exported EEG. We used a patient as well as a simulated EEG recording to highlight the effects of the display settings on the extracted EEG. Therefore, we changed EEG feed and amplitude resolution on the display in a systematic manner. To visualize the effects of these changes, we present raw EEG segments and the density spectral array of the recording. Changing the display's amplitude resolution affects the amplitudes. If the amplitude resolution is too fine, the exported EEG contains clipped amplitudes. If the resolution is too coarse, the EEG resolution becomes too low leading to a low-quality signal making frequency analysis impossible. The proportion of clipped or zero-line data caused by the amplitude setting was > 60% in our sedated patient. Changing the display settings results in undocumented changes in EEG amplitude, sampling rate, and signal quality. The occult nature of these changes could make the analysis of data sets difficult if not invalid. We strongly suggest researchers adequately define and keep the EEG display settings to export good quality EEG and to ensure comparability among patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32813139/

Reducing workload helps to free cognitive resources and thus influences human performance, which ultimately improves the quality of care. Among the many methods available to assess perceived workload, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) provides the most widely accepted tool. However, only few studies have investigated the validity of the NASA-TLX in the health care sector.
This study aimed to validate a modified version of the raw NASA-TLX in patient monitoring tasks by investigating its correspondence with expected lower and higher workload situations and its robustness against nonworkload-related covariates. This defines criterion validity.
In this pooled analysis, we evaluated raw NASA-TLX scores collected after performing patient monitoring tasks in four different investigator-initiated, computer-based, prospective, multicenter studies. All of them were conducted in three hospitals with a high standard of care in central Europe. In these already published studies, we compared conventional patient monitoring with two newly developed situation awareness-oriented monitoring technologies called Visual Patient and Visual Clot. The participants were resident and staff anesthesia and intensive care physicians, and nurse anesthetists with completed specialization qualification. We analyzed the raw NASA-TLX scores by fitting mixed linear regression models and univariate models with different covariates.
We assessed a total of 1160 raw NASA-TLX questionnaires after performing specific patient monitoring tasks. Good test performance and higher self-rated diagnostic confidence correlated significantly with lower raw NASA-TLX scores and the subscores (all P<.001). Staff physicians rated significantly lower workload scores than residents (P=.001), whereas nurse anesthetists did not show any difference in the same comparison (P=.83). Standardized distraction resulted in higher rated total raw NASA-TLX scores (P<.001) and subscores. There was no gender difference regarding perceived workload (P=.26). The new visualization technologies Visual Patient and Visual Clot resulted in significantly lower total raw NASA-TLX scores and all subscores, including high self-rated performance, when compared with conventional monitoring (all P<.001).
This study validated a modified raw NASA-TLX questionnaire for patient monitoring tasks. The scores obtained correctly represented the assumed influences of the examined covariates on the perceived workload. We reported high criterion validity. The NASA-TLX questionnaire appears to be a reliable tool for measuring subjective workload. Further research should focus on its applicability in a clinical setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32780712/

Malpractice insurance was provided by the Controlled Risk Insurance Company (CRICO), a patient safety and medical malpractice insurance company owned by and providing service to the Harvard medical community. CRICO spearheaded an effort to reduce these costs and ultimately found a way to decrease the risks associated with anesthesia. Here, we chronicle events that led to the dramatic changes in medical practice that resulted from the activities of a small group of concerned anesthesiologists at Harvard-affiliated hospitals. We place these events in a historical perspective and explore how other specialties followed this example, and end with current strategies that minimize the risk associated with anesthesia. We conducted interviews with principals who formulated original standards of patient monitoring. In addition, we consulted documents in the public domain and primary source material. Efforts of these pioneers resulted in the establishment of the seminal Harvard-based anesthesia monitoring standards for minimal monitoring. What followed was an unprecedented transformation of the entire field. After the implementation of these standards at Harvard-affiliated hospitals, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) adopted ""Standards for Basic Anesthetic Monitoring"" for use during the administration of all anesthetics in the United States. Other nations have since adopted similar guidelines and these practices have resulted in significant improvements in patient safety. Currently, we estimate mortality due to anesthesia in healthy patients to be 1:400,000-perhaps as much as 10 times lower since the early 1980s. What began as an attempt to lower medical malpractice costs in a group of university hospitals became a worldwide effort that resulted in improvements in patient safety. Other specialties have adopted similar measures. Currently, an attitude and appreciation of safety are exemplified by several practices that include among others-the adherence to these patient safety guidelines, simulator training, the promulgation of standards and guidelines by ASA, and the use of a safety checklist before induction of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32665466/

Despite results of clinical trials supporting an increasing indication for HIPEC in EOC, concerns have existed regarding morbidity and challenges with initiating HIPEC at an institutional level. The objective of this review is to describe evidence-based recommendations to guide implementation of a HIPEC program, following our experience at a high-volume tertiary care center. Establishing a HIPEC program requires building a multi-disciplinary team, including gynecologic oncologists, anesthesia, nursing, perfusionists and pharmacists. Team members require education regarding HIPEC protocols, toxic waste and spill management, and personal protective equipment (PPE). Required equipment includes chemotherapy certified PPE and a HIPEC pump which is connected to inflow and outflow catheters placed within the peritoneal cavity. During the procedure, 3-6 L of a hyperthermic perfusate, composed of a isotonic crystalloid vehicle and the chemotherapy of choice, is infused through the peritoneal cavity with goal temperature of 41-43 °C. Prior to HIPEC infusion, surgical teams must communicate with anesthesia and pharmacy. In patients receiving HIPEC with cisplatin, furosemide and mannitol should be administered one hour prior to chemotherapy to ensure adequate diuresis. Sodium thiosulfate may also be considered for renal protection (van Driel et al., n.d. [3]). We utilize a multi-agent pre-medication protocol prior to HIPEC infusion to reduce hypersensitivity reactions, renal toxicity and post-operative nausea and vomiting. Limited data exists to support the optimal regimen for HIPEC at the time of CRS in women with EOC. From our experience, we favor use of cisplatin 100 mg/m",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32624234/

Adequate anesthesia management is integral to patients' perioperative care, which consists of the three phases of preoperative assessment and optimization, intraoperative care, and postoperative recovery. The preoperative anesthesia evaluation focusses on the cardiorespiratory and neurologic systems, as well as the airway, but also extends to ensure the optimal treatment of significant comorbidities before surgical intervention. The goals of intraoperative care are maintenance of brain physiology, facilitating surgery, and correcting any adverse effects of surgery and underlying pathology to preserve general patient homeostasis. This requires adequate intraoperative patient monitoring, cardiorespiratory support, management of infusion therapy, and application of knowledge about the effects of anesthetic agents on brain physiology.

Current state-of-the-art monitors display vital signs as numbers and waveforms. Visual Patient technology creates an easy-to-interpret virtual patient avatar model that displays vital sign information as it would look in a real-life patient (eg, avatar changes skin color from healthy to cyanotic depending on oxygen saturation). In previous studies, anesthesia providers using Visual Patient perceived more vital signs during short glances than with conventional monitoring.
We aimed to study the deeper mechanisms underlying information perception in conventional and avatar-based monitoring.
In this prospective, multicenter study with a within-subject design, we showed 32 anesthesia providers four 3- and 10-second monitoring scenarios alternatingly as either routine conventional or avatar-based in random sequence. All participants observed the same scenarios with both technologies and reported the vital sign status after each scenario. Using eye-tracking, we evaluated which vital signs the participants had visually fixated (ie, could have potentially read and perceived) during a scenario. We compared the frequencies and durations of participants' visual fixations of vital signs between the two technologies.
Participants visually fixated more vital signs per scenario in avatar-based monitoring (median 10, IQR 9-11 versus median 6, IQR 4-8, P<.001; median of differences=3, 95% CI 3-4). In multivariable linear regression, monitoring technology (conventional versus avatar-based monitoring, difference=-3.3, P<.001) was an independent predictor of the number of visually fixated vital signs. The difference was less prominent in the longer (10-second) scenarios (difference=-1.5, P=.04). Study center, profession, gender, and scenario order did not influence the differences between methods. In all four scenarios, the participants visually fixated 9 of 11 vital signs statistically significantly longer using the avatar (all P<.001). Four critical vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate) were visible almost the entire time of a scenario with the avatar; these were only visible for fractions of the observations with conventional monitoring. Visual fixation of a certain vital sign was associated with the correct perception of that vital sign in both technologies (avatar: phi coefficient=0.358; conventional monitoring: phi coefficient=0.515, both P<.001).
This eye-tracking study uncovered that the way the avatar-based technology integrates the vital sign information into a virtual patient model enabled parallel perception of multiple vital signs and was responsible for the improved information transfer. For example, a single look at the avatar's body can provide information about: pulse rate (pulsation frequency), blood pressure (pulsation intensity), oxygen saturation (skin color), neuromuscular relaxation (extremities limp or stiff), and body temperature (heatwaves or ice crystals). This study adds a new and higher level of empirical evidence about why avatar-based monitoring improves vital sign perception compared with conventional monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32175913/

The most typical symptom is photosensitivity caused by activated protoporphyrins (wavelength ~400 nm). Accumulated protoporphyrin in the liver also causes liver failure, and liver transplantation is the only life-saving treatment. Phototoxic injury to abdominal organs has been reported during liver transplantation. Thus, to avoid phototoxic injury during liver transplantation, it has previously been conducted with only shadowless lights and ceiling lights off in the operating theater. Here, we report a case of a safe and successful liver transplantation in a patient with erythropoietic protoporphyria where the operating theater lights were covered with polyimide film.

These false alarms can lead to an alert overload that causes a health care provider to miss important events that could be harmful or even life-threatening. As health care units become more dependent on monitoring devices for patient care purposes, the alarm fatigue issue has to be addressed as a major concern for the health care team as well as to enhance patient safety.
The main goal of this paper was to propose a feasible solution for the alarm fatigue problem by using an automatic reasoning mechanism to decide how to notify members of the health care team. The aim was to reduce the number of notifications sent by determining whether or not to group a set of alarms that occur over a short period of time to deliver them together, without compromising patient safety.
This paper describes: (1) a model for supporting reasoning algorithms that decide how to notify caregivers to avoid alarm fatigue; (2) an architecture for health systems that support patient monitoring and notification capabilities; and (3) a reasoning algorithm that specifies how to notify caregivers by deciding whether to aggregate a group of alarms to avoid alarm fatigue.
Experiments were used to demonstrate that providing a reasoning system can reduce the notifications received by the caregivers by up to 99.3% (582/586) of the total alarms generated. Our experiments were evaluated through the use of a dataset comprising patient monitoring data and vital signs recorded during 32 surgical cases where patients underwent anesthesia at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. We present the results of our algorithm by using graphs we generated using the R language, where we show whether the algorithm decided to deliver an alarm immediately or after a delay.
The experimental results strongly suggest that this reasoning algorithm is a useful strategy for avoiding alarm fatigue. Although we evaluated our algorithm in an experimental environment, we tried to reproduce the context of a clinical environment by using real-world patient data. Our future work is to reproduce the evaluation study based on more realistic clinical conditions by increasing the number of patients, monitoring parameters, and types of alarm.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31769762/

Secondary outcomes were average pain, doses of postoperative opioids, unscheduled interventions, side-effects, patient satisfaction and length of hospital stay (LOS).
Mean time to postoperative mobilisation was 10.1 hours for patients in the INT-Group compared to 14.2 hours in the SC-Group; this corresponds to an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.54 (95% confidence interval 1.04-2.28). INT-Group patients received a higher dose of oral morphine equivalents; 26 mg vs 15 mg, P < .001; reported lower intensity of pain on a 0-10 scale; 2.1 vs 3.3, P < .001; and had higher patient satisfaction on a 5-point scale; 4.9 vs 4.3, P < .001. The LOS was similar between the groups; 71 hours in INT-Group vs 77 hours in SC-Group, P = .58. No serious side-effects were registered in INT-Group, whereas two were registered in SC-Group.
Introducing ESS as a decision tool combined with a wireless monitoring system resulted in less pain, increased satisfaction and more rapid mobilisation for patients in this study.

This article describes a qualitative content analysis (N = 19) using a closed-claims database generated by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) Foundation. The purpose of this study was to explore perioperative transfer-of-care events that contributed to professional malpractice claims to identify general themes, antecedents, and consequences to improve clinical practices and guide future research. A brief summary of the 6 themes that emerged in this study is as follows. (1) Patients should be transferred to an appropriate level of care based on their needs. (2) Production pressure leads to normalization of deviance. (3) Clinicians need to conduct their own patient assessments and health record reviews without relying solely on another clinician's report. (4) Interdisciplinary team communication failure is a leading cause of adverse outcomes. (5) Inadequate patient monitoring and physical assessment after the transfer of care is completed is a leading cause of adverse outcomes. (6) Transfer of care should not occur during high-risk patient care events or during periods of patient hemodynamic or respiratory instability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31584410/
31415292,Scope of Hand Surgery Using Surgeon Administered Local/Regional Anaesthesia.,Annals of plastic surgery,2019,"Sim WP, Ng HJH, Tan S, Bajaj SL, Rajaratnam V","Hand and wrist surgeries are often carried out under local/regional anesthesia. We describe our experience using Surgeon Administered Local/Regional Anaesthesia (SALoRA) without sedation to deliver acute and elective hand surgery anesthesia in a tertiary public hospital in Singapore. This is in comparison to wide awake local anesthesia no tourniquet, which has been increasing in popularity.
Retrospective analysis was conducted on all surgeries performed under SALoRA between January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2016, at our institution. Surgeries on areas other than the hand, wrist, forearm, and elbow were excluded. The records were reviewed to analyze the demographics of the patients, profile of cases performed, and their outcomes.
Of a total of 3016 cases performed, 1994 patients (1275 men; age, 45.78 ± 16 years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were available for analysis for the study period. The case distribution was similar to most other published data on day hand surgery cases. Tourniquet was used in 1357 (68%) of cases with an average operation time of 26 ± 19 minutes. Mean tourniquet use was 24 ± 15 minutes. Detailed analysis will be presented.
This study shows the versatility of SALoRA in delivering hand surgery in a cost-effective manner. A wide spectrum of surgeries in the hand, wrist, forearm, and elbow can be performed using SALoRA safely. This has increased productivity, efficiency, and use of resources. SALoRA has the advantage of a guaranteed and reliable bloodless field, quick turnaround time without the need of extra personnel and resources needed for patient monitoring to abide by Joint Commission International requirements and the potential risk of systemic adrenaline effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31415292/
31317870,Avatar-Based Patient Monitoring With Peripheral Vision: A Multicenter Comparative Eye-Tracking Study.,Journal of medical Internet research,2019,"Pfarr J, Ganter MT, Spahn DR, Noethiger CB, Tscholl DW","Continuous patient monitoring has been described by the World Health Organization as extremely important and is widely used in anesthesia, intensive care medicine, and emergency medicine. However, current state-of-the-art number- and waveform-based monitoring does not ideally support human users in acquiring quick, confident interpretations with low cognitive effort, and there are additional problematic aspects such as alarm fatigue. We developed a visualization technology (Visual Patient), specifically designed to help caregivers gain situation awareness quickly, which presents vital sign information in the form of an animated avatar of the monitored patient. We suspected that because of the way it displays the information as large, colorful, moving graphic objects, caregivers might be able to perform patient monitoring using their peripheral vision, which may facilitate quicker detection of anomalies, independently of acoustic alarms.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that avatar-based monitoring, when observed with peripheral vision only, increases the number of perceptible changes in patient status as well as caregivers' perceived diagnostic confidence compared with a high-fidelity simulation of conventional monitoring, when observed with peripheral vision only.
We conducted a multicenter comparative study with a within-participant design in which anesthesiologists with their peripheral field of vision looked at 2 patient-monitoring scenarios and tried to identify changes in patient status. To ensure the best possible experimental conditions, we used an eye tracker, which recorded the eye movements of the participants and confirmed that they only looked at the monitoring scenarios with their peripheral vision.
Overall, 30 participants evaluated 18 different patient status changes with each technology (avatar and conventional patient monitoring). With conventional patient monitoring, participants could only detect those 3 changes in patient status that are associated with a change in the auditory pulse tone display, that is, tachycardia (faster beeping), bradycardia (slower beeping), and desaturation (lower pitch of beeping). With the avatar, the median number of detected vital sign changes quadrupled from 3 to 12 (P<.001) in scenario 1, and more than doubled from 3 to 8 (P<.001) in scenario 2. Median perceived diagnostic confidence was confident for both scenarios with the avatar and unconfident in scenario 1 (P<.001), and very unconfident in scenario 2 (P=.024) with conventional monitoring.
This study introduces the concept of peripheral vision monitoring. The test performed showed clearly that an avatar-based display is superior to a standard numeric display for peripheral vision. Avatar-based monitoring could potentially make much more of the patient monitoring information available to caregivers for longer time periods per case. Our results indicate that the optimal information transmission would consist of a combination of auditory and avatar-based monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31317870/

Monitoring injection pressure during PNB is one method advocated to prevent injury by detecting needle tip placement in a noncompliant position (intraneural or abutting the epineurium). Animal studies show that gross neural damage and clinical injury are associated with injection pressures exceeding 15-20 psi. In contrast, pressures <15 psi are associated with an extraneural needle tip position and no histologic or clinical injury. Injection pressure monitoring has been shown to prevent injection against the brachial plexus roots or femoral nerve during peripheral nerve block. Multiple methods are available to monitor injection pressure, and most of them are inexpensive and easy to use.

The patient was unable to eat and was suffering from nausea and vomiting. Before admission, the patient had expressed her desire to discontinue treatment on several occasions.
The decision was made to initiate palliative sedation. The patient consented to take part in a study to assess level of comfort and pain using two monitoring devices (NeuroSense monitor and Analgesia Nociception Index monitor).
The patient died 90 h after initiation of palliative sedation. Titration of the medication was challenging and sedation was not deep enough during the first 2 days. Thirteen assessments made with the Ramsay Sedation Scale showed that the patient was considered to be in a deep sleep, while in fact the NeuroSense monitor indicated otherwise.

However, maintaining good situation awareness can be challenging when away from patient bedsides or a central monitoring station. In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the potential of a head-worn display that showed multiple patients' vital signs and alarms to improve supervising anesthesiologists' situation awareness.
Eight supervising anesthesiologists each monitored the vital signs of patients in six operating rooms for 3 h with the head-worn display, and for another 3 h without the head-worn display. In interviews with each anesthesiologist, we assessed in which situations the head-worn display was used and whether the continuous availability of the vital signs improved situation awareness. We also measured situation awareness quantitatively from six of the eight anesthesiologists, by instructing them to press a button whenever they noticed a patient alarm.
The median number of patient alarms occurring was similar when the anesthesiologists monitored with the head-worn display (42.0) and without the head-worn display (40.5). However, the anesthesiologists noticed significantly more patient alarms with the head-worn display (66.7%) than without (7.1%), P = 0.028, and they reported improved situation awareness with the head-worn display. The head-worn display helped the anesthesiologists to perceive and comprehend patients' current status and to anticipate future developments. A negative effect of the head-worn display was its tendency to distract during demanding procedures.
Head-worn displays can improve supervising anesthesiologists' situation awareness in multiple-patient monitoring situations. The anesthesiologists who participated in the study expressed enthusiasm about monitoring patients with a head-worn display and wished to use and evaluate it further.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30721389/

The combination of colloid coloading and vasopressors was considered our standard for its prevention and treatment. As the safety of hydroxyethyl starch is under debate, we replaced colloid with crystalloid coloading.
We hypothesize that the mean blood pressure drop is greater when coloading with crystalloids.
Prospective, observational clinical trial.
Two-centre study conducted in Berlin, Germany.
Parturients scheduled for a Caesarean section were screened for eligibility.
The study protocol and patient monitoring were based on the standard operating procedure for Caesarean section in both centres. The data from the crystalloid group were prospectively collected between November 2014 and July 2015.
The primary endpoint was the median drop in mean blood pressure after induction of spinal anaesthesia. Secondary endpoints were incidence of hypotension (drop > 20% of baseline systolic pressure /drop < 100 mmHg), vasopressor and additional fluid requirements (mL), incidence of bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats per minute), blood loss, Apgar score, and umbilical artery pH. In case of hypotension, patients received phenylephrine or cafedrine/theodrenaline according to their heart rate. A p < 0.05 was considered significant.
345 prospectively enrolled patients (n = 193 crystalloid group vs. n = 152 colloid group) were analysed. The median drop in mean blood pressure was greater in the crystalloid group [34 mmHg (25; 42 mmHg) vs. 21 mmHg (13; 29 mmHg), p < 0.001]. Incidences of hypotension [93.3% vs. 83.6%, p: 0.004] and bradycardia [19.7% vs. 9.9%, p: 0.012] were also significantly greater in the crystalloid group. Vasopressor requirements, blood loss and neonatal outcome were not different between the groups.
Crystalloid coloading was associated with a greater drop in mean blood pressure and a higher incidence of hypotension when compared with colloid coloading. Neonatal outcome was, however, unaffected by the type of fluid.

Nowadays, many simple surgical procedures are carried out in a one-day surgery regimen . A shorter hospital stay brings many advantages for the patients: lesser inconvenience, a lower risk of hospital infection and an earlier return to work. In proctology, day surgery polices are still uncommon because surgeons fear possible complications. In this paper we sum up our 15 years experience, stressing the possibility to perform even complex procedures in local-regional anesthesia and in a day-surgery context.
In our experience, to be candidate to one-day surgery proctological procdures, patients should be classed as ASA I or II.
Between 2005 and 2015 our operative unit executed a total of 2688 proctological procedures in a one-day surgery. 1062 procedures have been completed under local anesthesia exclusively and all patients have been discharged between two and three hours after the procedure without significant complications. In the other 1626 patients perineal posterior block was performed in 932 cases (57.3%) and provided an optimal pain control in 51,6% of cases (301 patients) while in 5,7% of cases there was the need for an intravenous administration of Fentanil.
Day-surgery is nowadays a concrete reality, made possible by an attentive selection of patients, an accurate surgical technique, an attentive patient monitoring in the postoperative period and a continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of pain medications.

The overuse of mental health medicines has featured in many reports, and insufficient patient monitoring has been identified as an important cause of medicine-related harms. Nurse-led monitoring using the structured adverse drug reaction (ADRe) profile identifies and addresses the adverse effects of mental health medicines. Our study investigates clinical impact and what is needed to sustain utilisation in routine practice in care homes.
This process evaluation will use interviews and observations with the participants of all five homes involved in earlier research, and five newly recruited homes caring for people prescribed mental health medicines. The ADRe profile is implemented by nurses, within existing resources, to check for signs and symptoms of ADRs, initiate amelioration and share findings with pharmacists and prescribers for medication review. Outcome measures are the numbers and nature of problems addressed and understanding of changes needed to optimise clinical gain and sustain implementation. Data will be collected by 30 observations and 30 semistructured interviews. Clinical gains will be described and narrated. Interview analysis will be based on the constant comparative method.
Ethical approval was conferred by the National Health Service Wales Research Ethics Committee. If the ADRe profile can be sustained in routine practice, it has potential to (1) improve the lives of patients, for example, by reducing pain and sedation, and (2) assist in early identification of problems caused by ADRs. Therefore, in addition to peer-reviewed publications and conferences, we shall communicate our findings to healthcare professionals, policy-makers and sector regulators.

Challenges in vaccination coverage contribute to the occurrence of non-neonatal tetanus in sub-Saharan countries, with high case fatality rates. The current WHO recommendations for the management of tetanus include close patient monitoring, administration of immune globulin, sedation, analgesia, wound hygiene and airway support [1]. In response to these recommendations, our tertiary referral hospital in Tanzania implemented a standardized clinical protocol for care of patients with tetanus in 2006 and a subsequent modification in 2012. In this study we aimed to assess the impact of the protocol on clinical care of tetanus patients and their outcomes.
We examined provision of care and outcomes among all patients admitted with non-neonatal tetanus to the ICU at Bugando Medical Centre between 2001 and 2016 in this retrospective cohort study. We compared three groups: the pre-protocol group (2001-2005), the Early protocol group (2006-2011), and the Late protocol group (2012-2016) and determined associations with mortality by univariable logistic regression. We observed a significant increase in provision of care as per protocol between the Early and Late groups. Patients in the Late group had a significantly higher utilization of mechanical ventilation (69.9% vs 22.0%, p< 0.0001), provision of surgical wound care (39.8% vs 20.3%, p = 0.011), and performance of tracheostomies (36.8% vs 6.7%, <0.0001) than patients in the Early group. Despite the increased provision of care, we found no significant decrease in overall mortality in the Early versus the Late groups (55.4% versus 40.3%, p = 0.069), or between the pre-protocol and post-protocol groups (60.7% versus 50.0%, p = 0.28). There was also no difference in 7-day ICU mortality (30.1% versus 27.8%, p = 0.70). Analysis of the causes of death revealed a decrease in deaths related to airway compromise (30.0% to 1.8%, p<0.001) but an increase in deaths due to presumed sepsis (15.0% to 44.6%, p = 0.018).
The overall mortality in patients suffering non-neonatal tetanus is high (>40%). Institution of a standardized tetanus management protocol, in accordance with WHO recommendations, decreased immediate mortality related to primary causes of death after tetanus. However, this was offset by an increase in death due to later ICU complications such as sepsis. Our results illustrate the complexity in achieving mortality reduction even in illnesses thought to require few critical care interventions. Improving basic ICU care and strengthening vaccination programs to prevent tetanus altogether are essential components of efforts to decrease the mortality caused by this lethal, neglected disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30161119/

We developed and evaluated a technology designed to improve perception of vital sign information by presenting patient status as an animated patient avatar.
After step-wise improvement of the avatar, anaesthesia professionals from two hospitals participated in a comparative study of conventional monitoring. Participants observed identical monitoring scenarios via the two technologies for brief time intervals and afterwards recalled patient status.
Overall, 150 anaesthesia professionals participated in the validation process and 32 participated in the comparative study, completing 128 scenarios, which allowed for 64 direct comparisons. The avatar's inter-rater reliability was high, with Fleiss' kappa of 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.96-0.99, P<0.001). With the avatar, participants recalled almost twice as many vital signs correctly as with conventional monitoring (9 vs 5, P<0.001). Perceived confidence was improved (2=certain vs 1=uncertain, P<0.001) and perceived workload lowered (task load index 60 vs 76, P<0.001). Participants obtained these results only after watching an educational video explaining the avatar and suggesting quick learnability and potential for real-life usability.

The algorithm must utilize continuously collected cardiopulmonary vital signs and may serve as an alternative to current practice, in which an alarm is activated by single parameters.
The study was a single center, prospective cohort study including 178 patients admitted to the PACU after major surgical procedures. Peripheral blood oxygenation, arterial blood pressure, perfusion index, heart rate and respiratory rate were monitored continuously. Potential ESODs were automatically detected and scored by two independent experts with regards to the severity of the observation. Based on features extracted from the obtained measurements, a random forest classifier was trained, classifying each event being either an ESOD or not an ESOD. The algorithm was evaluated and compared to the automated single modality alarm system at the PACU.
The algorithm detected ESODs with an accuracy of 92.2% (99% CI: 89.6%-94.8%), sensitivity of 90.6% (99% CI: 85.7%-95.5%), specificity of 93.0% (99% CI: 89.9%-96.2%) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 96.9% (99% CI: 95.3%-98.5%). The number of false alarms decreased by 85% (99% CI: 77%-93%) and the number of missed ESODs decreased by 73% (99% CI: 61%-85%) as compared to the currently used alarm system in the hospital. The algorithm was able to detect an ESOD in average 26.4 (99% CI: 1.1-51.7) minutes before the current single parameter system used in the PACU.
In conclusion, the proposed biomedical classification algorithm, when compared to the currently used single parameter alarm system of the hospital, showed significantly increased performance in both detecting ESODs fast and classifying these correctly.

This study sought to analyze the epidemiological and evolutionary profile of patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) ≤8 who entered follow-up in the Neurocritical Patient Monitoring Program (SPN) of Instituto Nacional de Donación y Trasplante (INDT), Uruguay.
SPN, a monitoring and follow-up program for neurocritical patients with GCS ≤ 8, prospectively collected data from 5 public and private intensive care units. A total of 160 patients with SAH with GCS ≤8 in 10 years were identified and analyzed using a 2-step nested model. Firstly, independent risk factors for mortality were identified, tested in different combinations, and one of them was selected using the best correct classification rate. In the second step, risk factors for evolution to brain death were investigated.
The mortality of patients with SAH with GCS ≤8 was 68%. Mortality for GCS 3 was 82%, significantly higher than for other values on the scale (P = .0025). Female sex (P = .011) and arterial hypertension (P = .017) were associated with higher mortality. There was no significant association between mortality and age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score, and Simplified Acute Physiologic Score II. Administration of analgesia and/or sedation was a protective factor (P < .0001). Of the patients who died, 50% were in brain death. We did not find clinical elements capable of identifying an increased probability of developing brain death.
Based on epidemiological data, models capable of improving the understanding of the complex process of death and particularly brain death can be generated. More studies are needed to explore the differential evolutionary behavior of critical neurological illness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29579814/

Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) experience substantial sleep disturbance. Despite the biological importance of sleep, sleep monitoring does not form part of standard clinical care for critically ill patients. There exists an unmet need to assess the feasibility and accuracy of a range of sleep assessment techniques that have the potential to allow widespread implementation of sleep monitoring in the ICU.
The coprimary outcome measures of this study are to: determine the accuracy and feasibility of motion accelerometer monitoring (ie, actigraphy) and subjective assessments of sleep (nursing-based observations and patient self-reports) to the gold standard of sleep monitoring (ie, polysomnography) in evaluating sleep continuity and disturbance. The secondary outcome measures of the study will include: (1) the association between sleep disturbance and environmental factors (eg, noise, light and clinical interactions) and (2) to describe the sleep architecture of intensive care patients.
A prospective, single centre observational design with a within subjects' assessment of sleep monitoring techniques. The sample will comprise 80 adults (aged 18 years or more) inclusive of ventilated and non-ventilated patients, admitted to a tertiary ICU with a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score between +2 (agitated) and -3 (moderate sedation) and an anticipated length of stay >24 hours. Patients' sleep quality, total sleep time and sleep fragmentations will be continuously monitored for 24 hours using polysomnography and actigraphy. Behavioural assessments (nursing observations) and patients' self-reports of sleep quality will be assessed during the 24-hour period using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, subjective sleepiness evaluated via the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, along with a prehospital discharge survey regarding patients' perception of sleep quality and disturbing factors using the Little Sleep Questionnaire will be undertaken. Associations between sleep disturbance, noise and light levels, and the frequency of clinical interactions will also be investigated. Sound and luminance levels will be recorded at 1 s epochs via Extech SDL600 and SDL400 monitoring devices. Clinical interactions will be logged via the electronic patient record system Metavision which documents patient monitoring and clinical care.
The relevant institutions have approved the study protocol and consent procedures. The findings of the study will contribute to the understanding of sleep disturbance, and the ability to implement sleep monitoring methods within ICUs. Understanding the contribution of a clinical environment on sleep disturbance may provide insight into the need to address clinical environmental issues that may positively influence patient outcomes, and could dispel notions that the environment is a primary factor in sleep disturbance. The research findings will be disseminated via presentations at national and international conferences, proceedings and published articles in peer-reviewed journals.

One thousand two hundred eighty-nine patients less than 18 years old were analyzed. Data from individual patient admissions were divided into 19 groups by primary admission diagnosis or surgical procedure.
None.
Distributions at admission are dependent on patient age and admission diagnosis (p < 10(-6)). Heart rate decreases over time, whereas arterial blood pressure is relatively stable, with differences seen in the directions and magnitude of these trends when analyzed by diagnosis group (p < 10(-6)). Multiple linear regression analysis shows that patient age, diagnosis group, and physiologic vital sign value at admission explain 50-63% of the variation observed for that physiologic signal at 72 hours (or at discharge if earlier) with admission value having the greatest influence. Furthermore, the variance of either heart rate or arterial blood pressure for the individual patient is smaller than the variance measured at the level of the group of patients with the same diagnosis.
This is the first study reporting distributions of continuously measured physiologic variables and trends in their behavior according to admission diagnosis in critically ill children.

In addition, given its sedative effects, a low dose of the agent is also widely used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, personality disorders, substance abuse, and sleep disturbances. In this case study, quetiapine was the first effective drug in reducing chronic insomnia in a male patient with a long treatment history. Because its effect declined over time, in the course of two years, a gradual dose increase led to a posology 50 times higher than the off-label dosage used to obtain sedation, i.e. 25-100 mg quetiapine administered once daily. This case raises awareness of the ease with which dose escalation of quetiapine occurs. The risk of side effects and, possibly, dependence and abuse underlines the importance of regular and careful patient monitoring. Given the unexpected effectiveness of the agent and the absence of side effects in the described case, we argue that in treatment-resistant insomnia, a high dose of quetiapine may be justifiable in selected cases but also urge that further research on the long-term effects and potential adverse events of quetiapine for this indication is of the utmost importance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27960654/

Sedation techniques aim to achieve rapid patient turnover through the use of short-acting drugs with minimal residual side-effects (mainly propofol and opioids). Even for common procedures, the practice of sedation delivery varies widely among providers. Computer-based sedation models have the potential to assist sedation providers and offer a more consistent and safer sedation experience for patients.
Target-controlled infusions using propofol and other short-acting opioids for sedation have shown promising results in terms of increasing patient safety and allowing for more rapid wake-up times. Target-controlled infusion systems with real-time patient monitoring can titrate drug doses automatically to maintain optimal depth of sedation. The best recent example of this is the propofol-based Sedasys sedation system. Sedasys redefined individualized sedation by the addition of an automated clinical parameter that monitors depth of sedation. However, because of poor adoption and cost issues, it has been recently withdrawn by the manufacturer.
Present automated drug delivery systems can assist in the provision of sedation for out-of-operating room procedures but cannot substitute for anesthesia providers. Use of the available technology has the potential to improve patient outcomes, decrease provider workload, and have a long-term economic impact on anesthesia care delivery outside of the operating room.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27054414/

To examine the acceptance of Google Glass as a patient monitoring device in a pediatric anesthesia context at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Australia.
We developed a custom-designed software solution for integrating Google Glass into the anesthesia environment, which enabled the device user to continuously view patient monitoring parameters transmitted wirelessly from the anesthesia workstation.
A total of 40 anesthetists were included in the study. Each anesthetist used the device for the duration of a theater list.

Disturbed vital organ perfusion may lead to the development of postoperative complications, including neurological sequel and renal failure. Near-infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) represents one of up-to-date techniques of patient monitoring which is commonly used for the assessment of brain oximetry in thoracic aorta surgery, and - increasingly more often -in open-heart surgery. Algorithms for maintaining adequate brain saturation may result in a decrease of neurological complications and cognitive dysfunction following cardiac surgery. The assessment of kidney and visceral perfusion with tissue oximetry is gaining increasing interest during pediatric cardiac surgery. Attempts at decreasing complications by the use of brain oximetry during carotid endarterectomy, as well as thoracic and abdominal surgery demonstrated conflicting results. In recent years NIRS technique was proposed as a tool for muscle perfusion assessment under short term ischemia and reperfusion, referred to as vascular occlusion test (VOT). This monitoring extension allows for the identification of early disturbances in tissue perfusion. Results of recent studies utilizing VOT suggest that the muscle saturation decrease rate is reduced in septic shock patients, while decreased speed of saturation recovery on reperfusion is related to disturbed microcirculation.

A study protocol.,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,2015,"Eberl S, Monteiro de Olivera N, Preckel B, Streitberger K, Fockens P, Hollmann MW","The number of colonoscopies tremendously increased in recent years and will further rise in the near future. Because of patients' growing expectation on comfort during medical procedures, it is not surprising that the demand for sedation also expands. Propofol in combination with alfentanil is known to provide excellent analgosedation, however, its use is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular depression. Acupuncture could be a technique to reduce drug requirement while providing the same level of sedation and analgesia.
The study will be performed as a single centre, randomised, placebo controlled trial. 153 patients scheduled for propofol/alfentanil sedation during colonoscopy will be randomly assigned to receive electroacupuncture (P6, ST36, LI4), sham acupuncture, or placebo acupuncture. Following endoscopy patients and gastroenterologists have to fill in questionnaires about their sedation experiences. Additionally, patients have to accomplish the Trieger test before and after the procedure. Patient monitoring includes time adapted HR, SpO2, ECG, NIBP, exCO2, OAA/S, and the Aldrete score. The primary outcome parameter is the dosage of propofol necessary for an adequate level of sedation to tolerate the procedure (OAA/S < 4). Effectiveness of sedation, classified by satisfaction levels measured by questionnaires is the secondary outcome parameter.
Moderate to deep sedation using propofol is increasingly applied during colonoscopies with a high satisfaction level among patients despite well-known hemodynamic and respiratory side effects of this hypnotic agent. Acupuncture is known to attenuate gastrointestinal discomfort and pain.

26446688,Anesthetic considerations in HELLP syndrome.,Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,2016,"del-Rio-Vellosillo M, Garcia-Medina JJ","HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) is an obstetric complication with heterogonous presentation and multisystemic involvement. It is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes by intravascular breakdown of fibrin in hepatic sinusoids and reduction of platelet circulation by its increased consumption.
In terms of these patients' anesthetic management, it is essential to consider some details: (1) effective, safe perioperative management by a multidisciplinary approach, and quick, good communication among clinical specialists to achieve correct patient management; (2) neuroaxial block, particularly spinal anesthesia, is the first choice to do the cesarean if there is only moderate, but not progressive thrombocytopenia; (3) if a general anesthesia is required, it is necessary to control the response to stress produced by intubation, especially in patients with either severe high blood pressure or neurological signs, or to prevent major cerebral complications; (4) invasive techniques, e.g., as tracheostomy, arterial, and deep-vein canalization, should be considered; (5) if contraindication for neuroaxial anesthesia exists, rapid sequence intubation with general anesthesia should be regarded as an emergency in patients with full stomach; (6) increased risk of difficult airways should be taken into account.
Optimal patient management can be chosen after considering the risks and benefits of each anesthetic technique, and based on good knowledge of these patients' pathophysiological conditions.
Later, close patient monitoring is recommended for potential development of hemorrhagic complications, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or eclampsia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26446688/

Adequate management of chronic pain can represent a unique challenge, but remains an integral component of clinical treatment in relevant contexts. For nociceptive pain of moderate to severe intensity, opioid analgesics can be beneficial when other pain management strategies have failed to produce adequate relief. The decision to initiate long-term opioid therapy must be carefully weighed, and individualized treatment plans are often necessary to effectively treat pain while minimizing adverse effects. Part II of this 2-part continuing medical education article will describe the appropriate settings for initiation of opioid analgesia for dermatology patients and detail therapeutic strategies and patient monitoring guidelines.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26369841/

A qualitative document analysis.,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2016,"Stiel S, Heckel M, Christensen B, Ostgathe C, Klein C","Numerous (inter-)national guidelines and frameworks have been developed to provide recommendations for the application of palliative sedation (PS). However, they are still not widely known, and large variations in PS clinical practice can be found.
This study aims to collect and describe contents from documents used in clinical practice and to compare to what extent they match the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) framework recommendations.
In a national survey on PS in Germany 2012, participants were asked to upload their in-service templates, assessment tools, specific protocols, and in-service statements for the application and documentation of PS. These documents are analyzed by using systematic structured content analysis.
Three hundred seven content units of 52 provided documents were coded. The analyzed templates are very heterogeneous and also contain items not mentioned in the EAPC framework. Among 11 scales for the evaluation of sedation level, the Ramsey Sedation Score (n = 5) and the Richmond-Agitation-Sedation-Scale (n = 2) were found most often. For symptom assessment, three different scales were provided one time respectively. In all six PS statements, the common core elements were possible indications for PS, instructions on dose titration, patient monitoring, and care. Wide congruency exists for physical and psychological indications. Most documents coincide on midazolam as a preferred drug and basic monitoring in regular intervals. Aspects such as pre-emptive discussion of the potential role of sedation, informational needs of relatives, and care for the medical professionals are mentioned rarely.
The analyzed templates do neglect some points of the EAPC recommendations. However, they expand the ten-point scheme of the framework in some details. The findings may facilitate the development of standardized consensus documentation and monitoring draft as an operational statement.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26268785/

In the former the differences in saturation become perceptually closer as the oxygenation level becomes higher whereas in the latter the pitch differences are perceptually equivalent across the whole range of values. The results show that anaesthetist participants produce significantly more accurate judgements of both absolute oxygenation values and size of oxygenation level difference when a logarithmic, rather than a linear, scale is used. The line of best fit for the logarithmic function was also closer to x = y than for the linear function.

In adults, capnography is the gold standard in respiratory monitoring. An alternative technique used in sleep laboratories is respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP). However, it is not known if either monitor is well tolerated by pediatric patients for prolonged periods of time.
The goal of this study was to determine whether capnography or RIP is better tolerated in nonintubated, spontaneously breathing pediatric patients being treated with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA).
Nasal cannula capnography with oral sampling and thoracic and abdominal inductance plethysmography bands were placed along with the routine monitors on pediatric patients being treated for acute pain with IVPCA. Study monitors were left in place for as long as they were tolerated by the patient, up to a maximum of 24 consecutive hours. If the patient did not wear a particular study monitor for any reason, but tolerated the remaining monitor, participation in the study continued. If the patient would not wear either monitor, participation was terminated.
Twenty-six patients (18 female, eight male, average age 10.1 ± 5.5 years) consented to participate, but only 14 patients attempted to wear one or both the devices. Among those who wore either device, median time to device removal was 8.33 h (range 0.3-23.6 h) for capnography and 23.5 h (range 0.7-24 h) for RIP bands.
Children did not tolerate wearing capnography cannulae for prolonged periods of time, limiting the usefulness of this device as a continuous monitor of ventilation in children. RIP bands were better tolerated; however, they require further assessment of their utility. Until more effective, child-friendly monitors are developed and their utility is validated, guidelines recommended for adult patients cannot be extended to children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26040512/

With concerns about its use after the Neuberger review, an audit of patients on the CDP was performed to determine if the use of such a pathway should be continued locally.
A two-year retrospective audit of CDP use was conducted. Aspects of communication, initiation of CDP, patient monitoring, medications, nutrition, and hydration were assessed.
In the 111 patient records reviewed, there were documented extent of care discussions with 94% of caregivers and 29% of patients before CDP initiation. Of the 88% of CDPs initiated within office hours, 90% fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All patients were monitored at least every eight hours. Seventy-three patients (66%) were prescribed opioids or sedatives and subsequently monitored appropriately, albeit 56% had no documented prior discussion with caregivers regarding medication use. Indications for opioid use were documented for all patients and only one patient had documentation of excessive sedation. Oral feeding and parenteral hydration were continued in 85% and 74% of patients, respectively.
There was no documented compromise in medication safety, clinical monitoring, and provision of nutrition and hydration for patients on the CDP.

A number of features make it attractive for prehospital use. At Essex and Herts Air Ambulance Trust, as with other services and under the guidance of a standard operating procedure, ketamine is used for both procedural sedation and as an anaesthetic agent for rapid sequence intubation. Guidelines exist that define levels of sedation and detail minimum standards of monitoring and personnel required for each level.
We conducted a retrospective review from 4 years of our mission database for patients who had received ketamine for procedural sedation from the doctor-paramedic helicopter emergency medical service team. Other data relevant to the patient or the mission were also collected.
A total of 212 cases of ketamine used for procedural sedation were identified. In all, 111 (52.4%) were for fracture manipulations and 52 (24.5%) were to facilitate extrication. An overall 12.7% of patients were paediatric (less than 18 years) and 160 (75.5%) were male. The helicopter emergency medical service team was with the patient for a mean of 24.4 min after the 999 call and spent a mean of 44.6 min on scene before departing for the hospital, which, in 75% of cases, was by means of a helicopter.

A Holter monitor, recording a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) underwater, was applied to 16 pre-trained volunteer scuba divers (13 males and three females). Dive computers were synchronized with the Holter recorder to correlate the ECG tracings with diving events. Our main objective was to demonstrate the utility of recording over a period of time a good quality 12-lead ECG underwater. The ECGs were analyzed for heart rate (HR), arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities and ischaemic events in relation to various stages of diving as follows: baseline, pre diving, diving, and post diving.
The ECG tracings were of good quality with minimal artefacts. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated a significant difference in HR during the various diving stages (P < 0.0001). Other recorded ECG abnormalities included supraventricular ectopic beats (four cases), ventricular ectopic beats (eight cases) and ventricular couplets (two cases). Conduction abnormalities included rate-dependent right and left bundle branch block; however, these findings were previously known in these divers. No evidence of ischaemia was seen.

Erythrocyte sickling can result from extreme hypoxia and other physiologic stressors, as might occur during cancer therapy. Further, tumoral hypoxia, a poor prognostic and predictive factor, could lead to a cycle of local sickling and increased hypoxia.
A search of PubMed produced 150 publications, most of which were excluded because of incidental relevance. Eleven case reports of patients diagnosed from 1993 to 2013 were reviewed.
Two reports of patients with sickle cell trait describe an abundance of sickled erythrocytes within tumors, and a third report describes sickling-related events requiring multiday hospitalization. Eight reports of patients with sickle cell disease delineated multiorgan failure, vaso-occlusive crises, and rapid renal deterioration. Hypothesized triggers are delayed clearance of anticancer agents attributable to baseline kidney damage, activation of vasoadherent neutrophils from treatment to counter chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, hypoxia from general anesthesia, and intratumoral hypoxia.
Clinical implications include pretreatment genotyping for prophylaxis, dose adjustment, and enhanced patient monitoring. With the current lack of high-quality evidence, however, the scope of poor outcomes remains unknown.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25144888/

It is important to detect burst suppression reliably during the administration of anesthetic or sedative agents, especially for cerebral-protective treatments in various neurosurgical diseases. This study investigates recurrent plot (RP) analysis for the detection of the burst suppression pattern (BSP) in EEG. The RP analysis is applied to EEG data containing BSPs collected from 14 patients. Firstly we obtain the best selection of parameters for RP analysis. Then, the recurrence rate (RR), determinism (DET), and entropy (ENTR) are calculated. Then RR was selected as the best BSP index one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparison tests. Finally, the performance of RR analysis is compared with spectral analysis, bispectral analysis, approximate entropy, and the nonlinear energy operator (NLEO). ANOVA and multiple comparison tests showed that the RR could detect BSP and that it was superior to other measures with the highest sensitivity of suppression detection (96.49%, P = 0.03). Tracking BSP patterns is essential for clinical monitoring in critically ill and anesthetized patients. The purposed RR may provide an effective burst suppression detector for developing new patient monitoring systems.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24883378/

Pulse CO-Oximetry is a recent advancement in patient monitoring that allows for the continuous noninvasive measurement of Hb (SpHb). The aim of this study was to describe the distribution and elimination of hydroxyethylstarch (HES) 130/0.4 in combination with crystalloids using a noninvasive Hb monitor in two cohorts of young children undergoing minor surgeries under general anesthesia. Two cohorts, 16 children aged 1-3 years and 12 aged 4-6 years, were investigated during anesthesia and minor surgical procedures. They were given a maintenance solution of lactated Ringer's and a fluid bolus of HES 130/0.4, 6 mL/kg over a period of 20 min. The whole procedure lasted 120 min, and SpHb values were measured every 10 min. The SpHb values were used to calculate plasma dilution, net volume, and mean residence time (MRT) of the infused fluid. A total of 377 measured SpHbs generated individual dilution plots that showed variability, particularly for the older cohort. Distribution and elimination rates of the infused fluid were calculated. Mean dilution plots were generated. There were no significant differences in dilution, net volume or MRT between groups. A non invasive Hb analyzer could be used to calculate fluid distribution. The variability in the data can probably be explained by reactions to anesthetic drugs, variability in measurement technique, variability in generating the complex capillary signals, and individual variability in baseline fluid status. The latter finding is important because this is a prerequisite for perioperative fluid planning for each individual.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24549461/

The study will be performed as a randomized controlled trial. The first 64 consenting patients will be randomized to either the propofol or the dexmedetomidine group. Following endoscopy patients and gastroenterologists have to fill in questionnaires (PSSI, CSSI) (see abbreviations) about their sedation experiences. Additionally, patients have to accomplish the Trieger test before and after the procedure. Patient monitoring includes time adapted HR, SO₂, ECG, NIBP, exCO₂, NICO, sweat conductance measurement, OAA/S, and the Aldrete score. Effectiveness of sedation, classified by satisfaction levels and pain and sedation score measured by questionnaires is the primary outcome parameter. Respiratory and hemodynamic complications are surrogate parameters for the secondary outcome parameter ""safety"".

Arterial blood was sampled at regular intervals during the maintenance phase of anaesthesia and measured plasma propofol concentrations were compared with those estimated using TCI.
Large tertiary referral centre in Birmingham, UK, with a specialist neuroanaesthesia service.
Fifty ASA status I to III adult patients undergoing elective neurosurgery.
Performance of Marsh model as assessed by median performance error (bias) and median absolute performance error (imprecision).
Performance of the Marsh model showed a positive bias (median performance error) of 27.6%, and imprecision (median absolute performance error) of 29.4%. Analysis of pooled data demonstrated greatest bias in the early phase (15 to 30 min) of anaesthesia (mean prediction error of 51.6%). Analysis of covariates demonstrated that obesity (BMI >30 kg m(-2)) contributed around half of the bias detected (mean prediction error 47 vs. 23%, P < 0.001). Patients with advanced age and significant comorbidity (ASA physical status class >2) actually demonstrated significantly lower prediction errors.
Pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that the performance of the Marsh model in effect site mode is poor in this broad patient population. The greatest bias demonstrated occurred in the early maintenance phase of anaesthesia. Of the covariates analysed, obesity contributed most significantly to an increased bias. Despite overall poor performance of the Marsh model, attending anaesthesiologists modified targeted propofol concentrations only 0.3 times per hour on average, using remifentanil dose modification nine times more frequently, with good surgical conditions in all patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23962821/

Data were collected using a web-based questionnaire on practice, educational standards and protocols related to nurse-administered PSA. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data.
A sample of 62 nurses, each from a different CCL, completed a questionnaire that focused on PSA practice. Over half of the estimated total number of CCLs in Australia and New Zealand was represented. Nurse-administered PSA was used in 94% (n=58) of respondents CCLs. All respondents indicated that benzodiazepines, opioids or a combination of both is used for PSA (n=58). One respondent indicated that propofol was also used. 20% (n=12) indicated that deep sedation is purposefully induced for defibrillation threshold testing and cardioversion without a second medical practitioner present. Sedation monitoring practices vary considerably between institutions. 31% (n=18) indicated that comprehensive education about PSA is provided. 45% (n=26) indicated that nurses who administer PSA should undergo competency assessment.
By characterising nurse-administered PSA in Australian and New Zealand CCLs, a baseline for future studies has been established. Areas of particular importance to improve include protocols for patient monitoring and comprehensive PSA education for CCL nurses in Australia and New Zealand.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23850189/

However, in this group of highly vulnerable patients, more intensive treatment may promote the chances of unwanted adverse effects and hence, iatrogenic damage. Therefore, we state that critically ill patients probably benefit from a more cautious approach. Using data from large clinical trials of previous years, we exemplify that less intensive treatment is associated with a better outcome in intensive care patients and suggest that we reappraise patient management as well as trial design in intensive care medicine while bearing in mind the ""less is more"" paradigm. We illustrate our case by describing the intensity of the most relevant treatment options for patients with septic shock, including mechanical ventilation, fluid management, blood pressure-targeted therapy, corticosteroids, patient monitoring, sedation, and nutrition. We conclude that treatment of critically ill patients while keeping in mind the ""less is more"" paradigm might not only benefit the patient but could also have a notable impact on the ever-increasing intensive care-related health care costs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23752755/

We aimed to evaluate the use and safety of transoesophageal Doppler (TED) monitoring of cardiac output (CO) under hyperbaric conditions in haemodynamically unstable patients diagnosed with NF and sepsis or septic shock.
Cardiac output was measured prior to, during and after HBOT with the use of TED in seven consecutive patients diagnosed with NF and sepsis or septic shock. The HBOT followed our standard protocol for NF patients, consisting of 90 minutes' exposure to 100% oxygen at 284 kPa. The difference between mean CO just prior to HBOT initiation and at near-maximum treatment duration was assessed using the Student's paired t-test.
TED was feasible and easy to use under hyperbaric conditions. We experienced no problems with the measurement of CO or with equipment-related safety during HBOT. Five patients had an increase in CO from initiation of HBOT to near-maximum treatment duration, one patient had a stable CO, while one patient experienced a slight decrease in CO. Overall, there was an increase in mean CO of 1.7 L min-1 (95% CI 0.02 to 3.34 L min-1, P = 0.048) from initiation of HBOT to near-maximum treatment duration.
This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to document that TED can provide a minimally-invasive estimate of CO in haemodynamically unstable patients with NF and sepsis or septic shock during HBOT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23508657/

Nurses play an important part in managing sedation because the prescription is usually given verbally directly from the cardiologist who is performing the procedure and typically, an anaesthetist is not present.
A qualitative exploratory design was employed.
Semi-structured interviews with 23 nurses from 16 cardiac catheterisation laboratories across four states in Australia and also New Zealand were conducted. Data analysis followed the guide developed by Braun and Clark to identify the main themes.
Major themes emerged from analysis regarding the lack of access to anaesthetists, the limitations of sedative medications, the barriers to effective patient monitoring and the impact that the increasing complexity of procedures has on patients' sedation requirements.
The most critical issue identified in this study is that current guidelines, which are meant to apply regardless of the clinical setting, are not practical for the cardiac catheterisation laboratory due to a lack of access to anaesthetists. Furthermore, this study has demonstrated that nurses hold concerns about the legitimacy of their practice in situations when they are required to perform tasks outside of clinical practice guidelines. To address nurses' concerns, it is proposed that new guidelines could be developed, which address the unique circumstances in which sedation is used in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory.
Nurses need to possess advanced knowledge and skills in monitoring for the adverse effects of sedation. Several challenges impact on nurses' ability to monitor patients during procedural sedation and analgesia. Preprocedural patient education about what to expect from sedation is essential.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23451942/

The role of the pulse oximeter in modern anesthesia care.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2013,"Shah A, Shelley KH","Since the discovery of anesthetic agents, patient monitoring has been considered one of the core responsibilities of the anesthesiologist. As depicted in Robert Hinckley's famous painting, The First Operation with Ether, one observes William Thomas Green Morton carefully watching over his patient. Since its founding in 1905, 'Vigilance' has been the motto of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). Over a hundred years have passed, and one would think we would be clear regarding what we are watching for and how we should be watching. On the contrary, the introduction of new technology and outcome research is requiring us to re-examine our fundamental assumptions regarding what is and what is not important in the care of the patient. A vast majority of anesthesiologists would refuse to proceed with an anesthetic without the presence of a pulse oximeter. On the other hand, outcome studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in patient care with their use. For that matter, it can be argued that outcome studies have yet to demonstrate an unambiguous role for any monitor of any type (i.e. blood pressure cuff or ECG), as outcome studies may fail to capture rare events. Because of the increased safety that has been attributed to pulse oximetry, it is unlikely that further studies can or will be conducted. As we enter a new era of clinical monitoring, with an emphasis on noninvasive cardiovascular monitoring, it might be of benefit to examine the role of the pulse oximeter in clinical care. This article reviews the available evidence for pulse oximetry. Further, it discusses contemporary issues, events, and perceptions that may help to explain how and why pulse oximetry may have been adopted as a standard of care despite the lack of supportive. Lastly, it discusses less obvious benefits of pulse oximetry that may have further implications on the future of anesthesia care and perhaps even automated anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23314807/

However, the anesthesia provider sometimes fails to engage the patient monitor to make periodic (generally every 3-5 min) measurements of Non-Invasive Blood Pressure (NIBP), which can lead to extended periods (>5 min) when blood pressure is not monitored. We describe a system to automatically detect such gaps in NIBP measurement and notify clinicians in real-time to initiate measurement. We applied a decision support system called the Smart Anesthesia Messenger (SAM) to notify the anesthesia provider if NIBP measurements have not been made in the last 7 min. Notification messages were generated only if direct arterial blood pressure was not being monitored. NIBP gaps were analyzed for 9 months before and after SAM notification was initiated (12,000 cases for each period). SAM notification was able to reduce the occurrence of extended NIBP gaps >15 min from 15.7 ± 4.5 to 6.7 ± 2.0 instances per 1,000 cases (p < 0.001). In addition, for extended gaps (>15 min) the mean gap duration declined from 23.1 ± 2.0 to 18.6 ± 1.1 min after SAM notification was initiated (p < 0.001). However, for 7-15 min gaps, SAM notification was not effective in reducing the occurrence. The maximum gap encountered before SAM was 64 min, while it was 27 min with SAM notification. Real-time notification using SAM is an effective way to reduce both the number of instances and the duration of inadvertent, extended (>15 min) gaps in blood pressure measurements in the operating room. However, the frequency of gaps <15 min could not be reduced using the current configuration of SAM.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23283561/

A concern in operating room environments is the amount of competing information and the effects that divided attention has on patient monitoring, such as detecting auditory changes in arterial oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry.
The authors measured the impact of visual attentional load and auditory background noise on the ability of anesthesia residents to monitor the pulse oximeter auditory display in a laboratory setting. Accuracies and response times were recorded reflecting anesthesiologists' abilities to detect changes in oxygen saturation across three levels of visual attention in quiet and with noise.
Results show that visual attentional load substantially affects the ability to detect changes in oxygen saturation concentrations conveyed by auditory cues signaling 99 and 98% saturation. These effects are compounded by auditory noise, up to a 17% decline in performance. These deficits are seen in the ability to accurately detect a change in oxygen saturation and in speed of response.
Most anesthesia accidents are initiated by small errors that cascade into serious events. Lack of monitor vigilance and inattention are two of the more commonly cited factors. Reducing such errors is thus a priority for improving patient safety. Specifically, efforts to reduce distractors and decrease background noise should be considered during induction and emergence, periods of especially high risk, when anesthesiologists has to attend to many tasks and are thus susceptible to error.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23263015/

Obesity may predispose to osteoarthritis, which may subject a high percentage of patients to shoulder surgery. Interscalene block remains one of the most efficient technique for postoperative analgesia after shoulder surgery. However, there are no specific guidelines or discussions in the literature about the use and management of interscalene block for obese patients. No study has yet specifically assessed obesity relative to interscalene block. Regional anesthesia offers certain advantages in obese patients: minimal airway intervention, improved postoperative analgesia, and decreased opioid consumption. In obese patients undergoing shoulder surgery, the goal of postoperative pain management is to provide comfort, early mobilization, and improved respiratory function without the worry of inadequate sedation and respiratory compromise. The ongoing debate on the relevance of obesity, for example in terms of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and other related respiratory disturbances, in relation to the choice of analgesic techniques, especially interscalene block, patient-controlled intravenous analgesia and patient monitoring, demands large-scale, well-designed studies to resolve it.

Existing databases have typically been collected from patients in intensive care units. However, the physical state of intensive care patients is dissimilar to those undergoing surgery, more frequent and marked changes to cardiovascular and respiratory variables are seen in operating room patients, and additional and highly relevant information to anesthesia (e.g., end-tidal agent monitoring, etc.) is omitted from these intensive care databases. We collected a set of high-quality, high-resolution, multiple-parameter monitoring data suitable for anesthesia monitoring research.
Vital signs data were recorded from patients undergoing anesthesia at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Software was developed to capture, time synchronize, and interpolate vital signs data from Philips IntelliVue MP70 and MP30 patient monitors and Datex-Ohmeda Aestiva/5 anesthesia machines into 10 millisecond resolution samples. The recorded data were saved in a variety of accessible file formats.
Monitoring data were recorded from 32 cases (25 general anesthetics, 3 spinal anesthetics, 4 sedations) ranging in duration from 13 minutes to 5 hours (median 105 min). Most cases included data from the electrocardiograph, pulse oximeter, capnograph, noninvasive arterial blood pressure monitor, airway flow, and pressure monitor and, in a few cases, the Y-piece spirometer, electroencephalogram monitor, and arterial blood pressure monitor. Recorded data were processed and saved into 4 file formats: (1) comma-separated values text files with full numerical and waveform data, (2) numerical parameters recorded in comma-separated values files at 1-second intervals, (3) graphical plots of all waveform data in a range of resolutions as Portable Network Graphics image files, and (4) graphical overview plots of numerical data for entire cases as Portable Network Graphics and Scalable Vector Graphics files. The complete dataset is freely available online via doi:102.100.100/6914 and has been listed in the Australian National Data Service Collections Registry.
The present dataset provides clinical anesthesia monitoring data from entire surgical cases where patients underwent anesthesia, includes a wide range of vital signs variables that are commonly monitored during surgery, and is published in accessible, user-friendly file formats.

We searched the database using the system's own classification and by scrutinising the free text of relevant incidents. There were 1029 relevant incidents. Of these, 410 (39.8%) concerned patient monitoring, most commonly screen failure during anaesthesia, failure of one modality or failure to transfer data automatically from anaesthetic room to operating theatre. Problems relating to ventilators made up 185 (17.9%) of the reports. Sudden failures during anaesthesia accounted for 142 (13.8%) of these, with a further 10 cases (0.9%) where malfunction caused a sustained or increasing positive pressure in the patient's airway.

The purpose of this study was to determine the resources used during the administration of PSA.
This prospective observational study was conducted in a Canadian urban teaching center. Detailed data concerning the dosage of PSA medications, adverse events, and ED times for patients requiring PSA for treatment of fractures, reductions of joint dislocations, and cardioversion for atrial fibrillation were collected. Descriptive analyses included proportions, means with standard deviations, and medians with interquartile ranges.
Of the 177 PSA cases considered for analysis, 69.5% were orthopedic manipulations and 30.5% were cardioversions. Propofol alone or combined with fentanyl was the commonest medication, and 27 minor adverse events were documented. The median number of staff used in each PSA was 4 (4, 4). The median time from triage to the start of the procedure was 175 minutes (98, 259). The median time from the end of monitoring to discharge was 186 minutes (104, 316). The median time from the start of PSA administration to the end of patient monitoring was 12 minutes for fractures/dislocations and 7 minutes for cardioversion.

Transnasal esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) allows easy access to the upper gastrointestinal tract and may avoid the complications induced by conscious sedation and reduce medical costs.
120 patients referred to diagnostic EGD were assigned to six groups: group 1, unsedated peroral EGD with normal-caliber endoscope; group 2, unsedated peroral EGD with small-caliber endoscope; group 3, sedated peroral EGD with normal-caliber endoscope; group 4, sedated peroral EGD with small-caliber endoscope; group 5, unsedated transnasal EGD with small-caliber endoscope; group 6, sedated transnasal EGD with small-caliber endoscope. Outcome parameters included objective (duration, oxygen saturation) and subjective measures (standardised visual analogue scales) of the endoscopy staff (handling, insertion, retroflexion, tolerability, overall assessment) and patients (pain, unpleasantness, sore throat, choking, gagging, meteorism, anxiety, acceptability).
The patients were comparable according to age, sex, anxiety, and respiratory function before EGD. Sedoanalgesia was without effect on EGD handling and duration, patient tolerability and overall assessment by endoscopists and assistants. Negative effects of sedoanalgesia (decreased oxygen saturation, patient acceptability) were much lower and without significance for transnasal compared to peroral EGD. Patient tolerability and acceptability of the endoscopic staff (handling, insertion, retroflexion) were significantly better for the small-caliber endoscope. Duration of unsedated transnasal EGD was slightly but significantly longer, pain, unpleasantness, and anxiety slightly but significantly higher compared to sedated peroral EGD. However, these differences could no loner be detected seven days after endoscopy. Cost analysis revealed major advantage for transnasal EGD.
Unsedated transnasal EGD may replace diagnostic peroral EGD, reduces costs with acceptable patient discomfort and has advantagous acceptability of the endoscopic staff.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20687017/

Three year retrospective review of perioperative cardiac arrests and death on operating table following surgical procedure under anaesthesia. For each cardiac arrest or death on the table the sequence of events leading to the arrest was evaluated using case notes, anaesthetic chart and ICU records. Study variables which include demographic data, ASA score, anaesthetic technique, causes and outcome were analysed and discussed.
Fourteen perioperative cardiac arrests were encountered following 4051 anaesthetics administered over the three year study period. Twelve out of the fourteen cardiac arrests occurred following general anaesthesia, while the remaining two occurred following spinal anaesthesia. There was no cardiac arrest following local anaesthesia. Children suffered more cardiac arrest than adults. ASA class III and IV risk status suffered more arrests than ASA I and II. Hypoxia from airway problems was the commonest cause of cardiac arrest followed by septic shock. Monitoring with pulse oximeter was done in only 4 out of the 14 cardiac arrests. Only 2 (14%) out of 14 cardiac arrests recovered to home discharge, one of them with significant neurological deficit.
Majority of arrests were due to hypoxia from airway problems that were not detected early There is need to improve on patient monitoring, knowledge of CPR and intensive care so as to improve the outcome of perioperative cardiac arrest.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20642084/

Previous studies of clinician behavior used an observer in the operating room, which may have altered behavior. We describe a covert observation technique to determine how often and for how long anesthesiologists actually look at the monitoring display during different segments of the maintenance phase of anesthesia, and to determine whether this changed with more than 1 anesthesia provider or during concomitant activities such as reading.
Five staff anesthesiologists, 2 anesthesia fellows, 3 anesthesia residents, and 2 medical students were covertly videotaped across 10 dual anesthesia provider cases and 10 solo cases. Videotapes were later segmented (5 minutes postinduction [early maintenance], mid-maintenance, and immediately before the drapes came down [late maintenance]) and coded for looking behavior at the patient monitor, anesthesia chart, and other reading material.
Anesthesiologists looked at the monitor in 1- to 2-second glances, performed frequently throughout the 3 segments of maintenance anesthesia. Overall, the patient monitor was looked at only 5 of the analyzed time, which is less than has previously been reported. Monitoring behavior was constant across the segments of maintenance anesthesia and was not significantly affected by the number of anesthesia providers or role (trainee vs. senior). In contrast, charting behavior and other reading material viewing changed significantly over the analyzed segments of maintenance anesthesia.

By using an OSA screening tool, we sought to define the prevalence of patients at high risk for OSA and to correlate OSA with the frequency of AMs and SRCs.
We enrolled 231 consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (n = 176) and endoscopic ultrasound (n = 55). Propofol-based sedation and patient monitoring were performed by a nurse anesthetist and an anesthesiologist. A previously validated screening tool for OSA (STOP-BANG) was used to identify patients at high risk for OSA (score, > or =3 of 8; SB+) or low risk (SB-). AMs were defined as a chin lift, modified mask ventilation, nasal airway, bag-mask ventilation, and endotracheal intubation. SRCs were defined as any duration of pulse oximetry less than 90%, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, apnea, or early procedure termination.
The prevalence of SB+ was 43.3%. The frequency of hypoxemia was significantly higher among patients with SB+ than SB- (12.0% vs 5.2%; relative risk [RR], 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.54). The rate of AMs was also significantly higher among SB+ (20.0%) compared with SB- (6.1%) patients (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4).

20450239,Implications of opioid analgesia for medically complicated patients.,Drugs & aging,2010,"Smith H, Bruckenthal P","Opioid analgesics have an established role in the management of postoperative pain and cancer pain, and are gaining acceptance for the management of moderate to severe chronic noncancer pain, most notably chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis, that does not respond to other interventions. Many patients with chronic pain have co-morbid medical conditions that may complicate opioid therapy. Selecting the appropriate opioid requires knowledge of how individual opioids differ with respect to metabolism and interaction with concurrent medications, as well as the reasons why specific medical conditions may influence their efficacy and tolerability. Polypharmacy is a common complicating condition in the elderly and in patients with psychiatric illness, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or other chronic illnesses. Polypharmacy, though often necessary for patients with multiple medical conditions, also multiplies the risk of drug interactions. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions can increase or reduce exposure to the opioid or concurrent medications, reducing efficacy and/or tolerability and increasing toxicity. Pharmacodynamic interactions can enhance the depressive effects of opioids, compromising safety. Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function may have difficulty clearing or metabolizing opioids and concurrent medications, leading to increased risk of adverse events. Patients with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or respiratory disease (including smokers of >/=2 packs/day with no other diagnosis) may be more susceptible to respiratory depression, bradycardia and hypotension with any opioid, and a few specific opioids pose additional risks. Patients with cerebrovascular disease, dementia, brain injury or psychiatric illness are more susceptible to opioid effects on the CNS, which can include euphoria, cognitive impairment and sedation. Appropriate opioid selection may mitigate these effects. Even in older patients, addiction, abuse and misdirection of prescribed opioids are of concern. Higher risk exists for patients with psychiatric illness, history of substance abuse, and identifiable substance abuse risk factors. Screening for abuse potential and vigilant patient monitoring should be routine. Opioids differ in their ability to produce euphoria, based on opioid receptor agonism, but substance abusers may be more influenced by availability, familiarity and cost factors. Consequently, opioid selection has limited influence on abuse potential but can facilitate ease of monitoring. This review provides an overview of opioid use in medically complicated patients and recommendations on how to optimize analgesia while avoiding adverse events and drug interactions in the clinical setting. Articles cited in this review were identified via a search of EMBASE and PubMed. Articles selected for inclusion discussed characteristics of specific opioids and general physiological aspects of opioid therapy in important patient populations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20450239/

This survey aimed at providing nationwide data on the current practice of endoscopic sedation and monitoring in Germany.
A 21-item survey regarding current practices of endoscopy, sedation and monitoring in gastrointestinal endoscopy was sent to 3 802 members of the German Society of Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS).
A total of 1 061 / 3 802 (28%) questionnaires were returned. The respondents performed an average of 28 esophagogastro-duodenoscopies (EGDs) and 25 colonoscopies per week. Endoscopic procedures were staged in a hospital setting (60%) more often than in private practices (40%). The majority of the EGDs (74%) and colonoscopies (87%) were carried out under sedation, however, this fact may be influenced by a recall bias. The most frequently used agents for sedation were midazolam in 82% and propofol in 74% of the cases. The most common sedation regimens applied were propofol plus benzodiazepines (38%) and benzodiazepines with an opioid (35%). Patients were routinely monitored by pulse oximetry (97%), automated blood pressure readings (29%) and/or electrocardiography (13%). Supplemental oxygen was routinely administered in 34% of them. Endoscopists' satisfaction with sedation was greater among those using propofol than in the group applying benzodiazepines (visual analogue scale, 8.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 8.2 +/- 1.3, p < 0.0001).
Besides the common administration of short-acting benzodiazepines, sedation with propofol is also gaining ground in Germany; it is applied mainly in low doses (up to 150 mg). German endoscopists are highly satisfied with these sedation regimens, with propofol significantly leading the score.

For the first analysis with clinical data, electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG) and invasive BP signals were obtained by a conventional patient monitoring device during surgery. In the second analysis, ECG, PPG and non-invasive BP were measured using systems developed to obtain data under conditions in which the subject was not constrained. To enhance the performance of BP estimation methods, heart rate (HR) and arterial stiffness were considered as confounding factors in regression analysis. The PAT and HR were easily extracted from ECG and PPG signals. For arterial stiffness, the duration from the maximum derivative point to the maximum of the dicrotic notch in the PPG signal, a parameter called TDB, was employed. In two experiments that normally cause BP variation, the correlation between measured BP and the estimated BP was investigated. Multiple-regression analysis with the two confounding factors improved correlation coefficients for diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure to acceptable confidence levels, compared to existing methods that consider PAT only. In addition, reproducibility for the proposed method was determined using constructed test sets. Our results demonstrate that non-invasive, non-intrusive BP estimation can be obtained using methods that can be applied in both clinical and daily healthcare situations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20009186/

This article reviews a recent program of research that investigates the advantages and disadvantages of monitoring with HMDs, and discusses the design considerations and implementation issues that must be addressed before HMDs can be clinically adopted.
HMDs let anesthesiologists spend a larger proportion of their time in the operating room looking towards the patient and surgical field, and a correspondingly smaller proportion of time looking at the standard monitors. Anesthesiologists can detect patient events faster with an HMD when they are busy performing procedures, but not during normal monitoring. There was no evidence of anesthesiologists' performance or monitoring behavior being affected by perceptual issues with the HMD, and no evidence that more events were missed with the HMD due to inattentional blindness.
Anesthesiologists may be able to monitor their patients more effectively when an HMD is used in conjunction with existing monitors, but several engineering and implementation issues need to be resolved before HMDs can be adopted in practice. Further research is needed on the design of information displays for HMDs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19770643/

Sixty-five patients underwent craniotomy for tumor resection using the iMRI during the period from April 2005 to December 2006. Anesthesiologists used an iMRI-compatible patient monitoring system (Veris MR, MEDRAD, Indianola, PA), anesthesia machine (Aestiva/5 MRI, Datex-Ohmeda, Madison, WI), and infusion pumps (Continuum; MEDRAD). Average setup time for each case (from intubation to incision) was one hour, 33 minutes and showed learning improvement over the 21-month period. The challenges facing the anesthesiologists in these cases included the need to use longer intravenous (IV) catheters and gas delivery and sampling lines, which increased dead space. Electrocardiographic signals became contaminated with electrical noise during iMRI scan procedures, which made it difficult to distinguish rhythm changes. None of our iMRI patients underwent a repeat resection, whereas the repeat resection rate for conventional tumor resection is reported to be as high as 30%. The use of a small, low-field iMRI system provided adequate imaging for resection of lesions without the need of repeat resections in the weeks following the initial procedure, and did not significantly alter the anesthetic procedure.

19384235,Perioperative anaesthetic management of mediastinal mass in adults.,European journal of anaesthesiology,2009,"Erdös G, Tzanova I","Mediastinal mass syndrome remains an anaesthetic challenge that cannot be underestimated. Depending on the localization and the size of the mediastinal tumour, the clinical presentation is variable ranging from a complete lack of symptoms to severe cardiorespiratory problems. The administration of general anaesthesia can be associated with acute intraoperative or postoperative cardiorespiratory decompensation that may result in death due to tumour-related compression syndromes. The role of the anaesthesiologist, as a part of the interdisciplinary treatment team, is to ensure a safe perioperative period. However, there is still no structured protocol available for perioperative anaesthesiological procedure. The aim of this article is to summarize the genesis of and the diagnostic options for mediastinal mass syndrome and to provide a solid detailed methodology for its safe perioperative management based on a review of the latest literature and our own clinical experiences. Proper anaesthetic management of patients with mediastinal mass syndrome begins with an assessment of the preoperative status, directed foremost at establishing the localization of the tumour and on the basis of the clinical and radiological findings, discerning whether any vital mediastinal structures are affected. We have found it helpful to assign 'severity grade' (using a three-grade clinical classification scale: 'safe', 'uncertain', 'unsafe'), whereby each stage triggers appropriate action in terms of staffing and apparatus, such as the provision of alternatives for airway management, cardiopulmonary bypass and additional specialists. During the preoperative period, we are guided by a 12-point plan that also takes into account the special features of transportation into the operating theatre and patient monitoring. Tumour compression on the airways or the great vessels may create a critical respiratory and/or haemodynamic situation, and therefore the standard of intraoperative management includes induction of anaesthesia in the operating theatre on an adjustable surgical table, the use of short-acting anaesthetics, avoidance of muscle relaxants and maintenance of spontaneous respiration. In the case of severe clinical symptoms and large mediastinal tumours, we consider it absolutely essential to cannulate the femoral vessels preoperatively under local anaesthesia and to provide for the availability of cardiopulmonary bypass in the operating theatre, should extracorporeal circulation become necessary. The benefits of establishing vascular access under local anaesthesia clearly outweigh any associated degree of patient discomfort. In the case of patients classified as 'safe' or 'uncertain', a preoperative consensus with the surgeons should be reached as to the anaesthetic approach and the management of possible complications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19384235/

In recent years, much research has been published about this subject that will be discussed in this review. The review concentrates on: a brief overview of the main developments during the last decade, an exploration of current debate regarding ethical dilemmas, the development of clinical guidelines, and the application of palliative sedation.
Main findings are that palliative sedation is mostly described in retrospective studies and that the terminology palliative sedation in now common in the majority of the studies. In addition, life-shortening effects for palliative sedation are scarcely reported, although not absent. A number of guidelines have been developed and published, although systematic implementation needs more attention. Consequently, palliative sedation has become more clearly positioned as a medical treatment, to be distinguished from active life shortening.
Caregivers should apply palliative sedation proportionally, guided by the symptoms of the patient without striving for deep coma and without motives for life shortening. Clinical and multidisciplinary assessment of refractory symptoms is recommended as is patient monitoring during sedation.

Therefore, patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures with the use of sedating agents are monitored by discontinuous non-invasive BP measurement (NIBP). Continuous non-invasive BP monitoring based on vascular unloading technique (CNAP, CN Systems, Graz) may improve patient safety in those settings. We investigated if this new technique improved monitoring of patients undergoing interventional endoscopy.
40 patients undergoing interventional endoscopy between April and December 2007 were prospectively studied with CNAP(R) in addition to standard monitoring (NIBP, ECG and oxygen saturation). All monitoring values were extracted from the surveillance network at one-second intervals, and clinical parameters were documented. The variance of CNAP values were calculated for every interval between two NIBP measurements.
2660 minutes of monitoring were recorded (mean 60.1+/-34.4 min/patient). All patients were analgosedated with midazolam and pethidine, and 24/40 had propofol infusion (mean 90.9+/-70.3 mg). The mean arterial pressure for CNAP was 102.4+/-21.2 mmHg and 106.8+/-24.8 mmHg for NIBP. Based on the first NIBP value in an interval between two NIBP measurements, BP values determined by CNAP showed a maximum increase of 30.8+/-21.7% and a maximum decrease of 22.4+/-28.3% (mean of all intervals).

Part II follows Part I's description of the software and simulation testing of the CDSS, and describes the hardware setup of a patient monitoring and CDSS. The system is evaluated on three post-cardiac surgery intensive care patients whom had all undergone cardio-pulmonary bypass.

Patients considered as 'very likely' to require active intervention to support the cardiovascular function following routine cardiac surgery were recruited during pre-operative surgical and anesthetic assessment, giving written informed consent when admitted for their operation. These patients underwent routine induction and maintenance of anesthesia by a non-study consultant anesthetist and the operation performed. There were no restrictions placed on the types of invasive monitoring used, on the use of trans-oesophageal echocardiography, drug selection, or the anesthetic agents selected by the clinicians performing the operations. All patients had full, routine invasive and non-invasive monitoring applied, including electrocardiography, central venous and peripheral arterial catheterisation, urine outputs and central temperature. After chest closure the patients were transferred to the CICU, sedated and ventilated, and the study commenced by the study anesthetist (1st author). The patients were in a clinically stable condition when admitted to the unit, and were attended by the treating clinicians until the handover to the study anesthetist occurred. The LiDCOplus (lithium dilution cardiac output) monitor (LiDCO Limited, Flowers Building, Granta Park, Cambridge CB1 6GU, United Kingdom) was calibrated after attachment to the patient's arterial line, and the patient's beat-to-beat hemodynamic data transferred to the host laptop computer. The CDSS graphical interface displays the patient's clinical details and specific cardiovascular data and prompts the anesthetist to input the target ranges for each parameter, and select a suitable advisor frequency. This is the frequency with which the therapeutic advice is displayed on screen with an audible prompt for a control inputs from the anesthetist. In each case this was selected to be 30s. When the study anesthetist agreed with the CDSS advice (administration of fluid, commencing a drug, altering the drug infusion rate) the syringe motif on the ""Advisor Infusion Rates"" panel of the graphical interface was 'clicked' on and the infusion rate immediately and manually inputted to Graseby 3400 pumps. If any disagreement between the anesthetist and the computer's advice arose, the syringe motif on the ""Expert Infusion Rates"" panel of the preferred drug was 'clicked' on and the expert's therapeutic decision (e.g. infusion rate) was entered in the corresponding data field and then applied to the pump. During all trials, data was stored for off-line analysis.
The CDSS successfully selected suitable drug therapies for each case and advised reasonable and appropriate infusion rates such that the study anesthetist did not have to override the suggested CDSS instructions and infusion rates. Under differing clinical conditions the system was able to maintain clinically appropriate and stable control of the cardiovascular system (CVS), with good profiles under noisy physiological measurements, and was readily able to regain control following transient deterioration of the patient hemodynamic parameters (coughing, or during blood sampling).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19112011/
19095847,Electrical noise in the intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging setting.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2009,"Dzwonczyk R, Fujii JT, Simonetti O, Nieves-Ramos R, Bergese SD","Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) is a tool now commonly used in neurosurgery. Safe and reliable patient care in this (or any other) operating room setting depends on an environment, where electrical noise (EN) does not interfere with the operation of the electronic monitoring or imaging equipment. In this investigation, we evaluated the EN generated by the iMRI system and the anesthesia patient monitor used at this institution that impacts the performance of these two devices.
We measured the EN generated by our iMRI-compatible anesthesia patient monitor as detected by the EN analysis algorithm in our iMRI system. We measured the EN generated by our iMRI system during scanning as detected in the electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform of our patient monitor. We analyzed the effects on EN reduction and signal quality of the ECG noise filters provided in our iMRI-compatible anesthesia patient monitor.
Our patient monitor generated EN that was detectable by the iMRI EN analysis algorithm; however, this interference was within the iMRI manufacturer's acceptable limits for an iMRI scan (<10% more than background system-level noise). In the clinical case analyzed, the iMRI generated a narrow-band low-frequency (20 Hz) relatively high-energy EN that interfered with the ECG signal of our patient monitor during an iMRI scan. This EN was correlated with the acoustic noise from the iMRI system during the scan and was associated with the radio frequency (RF) and magnetic gradient pulsations of the iMRI system. The integrity of the ECG waveform was nearly entirely lost during a scan. The filters of the ECG monitor diminished but did not entirely eliminate this 20 Hz interference. We found that the filters alter the morphology of the ECG signal, which may make it difficult to identify clinically relevant ECG changes.
The EN generated by our anesthesia patient monitor is within acceptable limits for the iMRI system. The iMRI generates EN which renders the ECG unreadable in the most commonly used filter mode. The monitor's filters diminish this noise but also alter the morphology of the ECG waveform. The anesthesiologist must be cognizant of these technical compromises and recognize that adjusting the ECG filters on the monitor is required to obtain a useful ECG signal for patient monitoring during the iMRI scan but that the diagnostic value of the ECG will be reduced.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19095847/

The procedure is routinely performed under conscious sedation in North America. A significant proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with EGD is related to hypoxia due to conscious sedation. The use of sedation is also associated with an increase in cost, loss of work on the day of endoscopy and the need for the patient to be accompanied home after the procedure. Transnasal endoscopy has advantages such as no sedation and less patient monitoring, nursing time and expenses than conventional per oral EGD.
To assess the feasibility and acceptability of unsedated transnasal EGD in daily practice.
Patients due to undergo EGD were given a choice of either unsedated transnasal EGD or per oral EGD with sedation. Patients who chose unsedated transnasal EGD had the procedure performed in the office by a senior gastroenterologist with experience in transnasal EGD. All procedures were performed using a small-calibre esophagogastroduodenoscope. All patients were surveyed using a patient satisfaction questionnaire, and were asked to give specific scores in terms of choking sensation, sore throat, nasal discomfort and abdominal discomfort. All variables were assessed by scores between 0 and 10, with 10 indicating the most severe degree of each variable. Any complications were also recorded.
Between March 2002 and August 2003, 231 patients underwent transnasal EGD. The median age of the patients was 57 years (range 15 to 87 years). Complete examinations were possible in 98% of patients. Patients reported a high degree of acceptability (mean score 6.6, range 1 to 10) and low degrees of choking sensation (mean 1.8, range 0 to 10), nasal discomfort (mean 1.7, range 0 to 10), sore throat (mean 0.8, range 0 to 9) and abdominal discomfort (mean 1.1, range 0 to 10). The only complications reported by the patients were epistaxis (n=2, 0.9%) and sinusitis (n=1, 0.4%). Some patients also reported transient light-headedness (n=12, 5%) and mucous discharge (n=2, 0.9%). When asked, 185 patients (88%) stated that they were willing to undergo the same procedure in the future if medically indicated. Of the 84 patients who had conventional EGD under conscious sedation in the past, 52 patients (62%) preferred transnasal EGD without sedation.
Transnasal EGD is generally well tolerated, feasible and safe. It can be performed with topical anesthesia in an outpatient setting. The low complication rate, high patient satisfaction and potential cost savings make transnasal endoscopy an attractive alternative to conventional EGD to screen patients for upper gastrointestinal tract diseases.
L’œsophagogastroduodénoscopie (OGD) est l’intervention diagnostique la plus pratiquée pour les troubles œsogastroduodénaux. Elle est couramment exécutée sous sédation consciente en Amérique du Nord. Une forte proportion de la morbidité et de la mortalité associées à l’OGD est reliée à l’hypoxie attribuable à la sédation consciente. La sédation est également liée à une augmentation des coûts, à l’absence du travail le jour de l’endoscopie et à la nécessité que le patient se fasse accompagner à la maison après l’intervention. L’endoscopie transnasale comporte des avantages, tels que l’absence de sédation et une diminution de la surveillance du patient, du temps des infirmières et des dépenses par rapport à l’OGD par voie orale classique.
Évaluer la faisabilité et l’acceptabilité de l’OGD transnasale sans sédation dans la pratique quotidienne.
Les patients devant subir une OGD ont eu le choix entre une OGD transnasale sans sédation et une OGD par voie orale sous sédation. Les patients qui choisissaient l’OGD transnasale sans sédation subissaient l’intervention en cabinet par un gastroentérologue principal expérimenté dans les OGD transnasales. Toutes les interventions étaient effectuées à l’aide d’un œsophagogastroduodénoscope de petit calibre. Tous les patients ont été interrogés à l’aide d’un questionnaire sur la satisfaction des patients et ont été invités à attribuer des indices précis sur la sensation d’étouffement, le mal de gorge, le malaise nasal et le malaise abdominal. Toutes les variables ont été évaluées au moyen d’indices de 0 à 10, 10 correspondant au degré le plus grave de chaque variable. Les complications ont également été enregistrées.
Entre mars 2002 et août 2003, 231 patients ont subi une OGD transnasale. Les patients avaient un âge médian de 57 ans (fourchette de 15 à 87 ans). Il a été possible de procéder à un examen complet chez 98 % des patients. Les patients ont déclaré un fort degré d’acceptabilité (indice moyen de 6,6, fourchette de 1 à 10) et un faible degré de sensation d’étouffement (moyenne 1,8, fourchette de 0 à 10), de malaise nasal (moyenne 1,7, fourchette de 0 à 10), de mal de gorge (moyenne 0,8, fourchette de 0 à 9) et de malaise abdominal (moyenne 11, fourchette de 0 à 10). Les seules complications qu’ont déclarées les patients sont une épistaxis (n=2, 0,9 %) et une sinusite (n=1, 0,4 %). Certains patients ont également déclaré de légers étourdissements (n=12, 5 %) et un écoulement de mucus (n=2, 0,9 %). Lorsqu’on leur a posé la question, 185 patients (88 %) ont affirmé qu’ils seraient prêts à subir la même intervention de nouveau si leur état médical l’exigeait. Des 84 patients qui avaient subi une OGD classique sous sédation consciente par le passé, 52 (62 %) ont préféré l’OGD transnasale sans sédation.
En général, l’OGD transnasale est bien tolérée, faisable et sécuritaire. On peut l’effectuer en consultations externes, au moyen d’une anesthésie topique. Le faible taux de complications, la forte satisfaction des patients et les économies potentielles font de l’endoscopie transnasale une solution de rechange intéressante par rapport à l’OGD classique pour dépister les patients atteints d’une maladie œsogastroduodénale.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18354752/

Annual International Conference,2007,"Gohil B, Gholamhhosseini H, Harrison MJ, Lowe A, Al-Jumaily A","Expert algorithms in the field of intelligent patient monitoring have rapidly revolutionized patient care thereby improving patient safety. Patient monitoring during anesthesia requires cautious attention by anesthetists who are monitoring many modalities, diagnosing clinically critical events and performing patient management tasks simultaneously. The mishaps that occur during day-to-day anesthesia causing disastrous errors in anesthesia administration were classified and studied by Reason [1]. Human errors in anesthesia account for 82% of the preventable mishaps [2]. The aim of this paper is to develop a clinically useful diagnostic alarm system for detecting critical events during anesthesia administration. The development of an expert diagnostic alarm system called ;RT-SAAM' for detecting critical pathological events in the operating theatre is presented. This system provides decision support to the anesthetist by presenting the diagnostic results on an integrative, ergonomic display and thus enhancing patient safety. The performance of the system was validated through a series of offline and real-time testing in the operation theatre. When detecting absolute hypovolaemia (AHV), moderate level of agreement was observed between RT-SAAM and the human expert (anesthetist) during surgical procedures. RT-SAAM is a clinically useful diagnostic tool which can be easily modified for diagnosing additional critical pathological events like relative hypovolaemia, fall in cardiac output, sympathetic response and malignant hyperpyrexia during surgical procedures. RT-SAAM is currently being tested at the Auckland City Hospital with ethical approval from the local ethics committees.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18002964/

It is fairly easy to obtain core temperature measurements invasively in anesthetized patients. However, such measurements are more difficult to obtain noninvasively in awake patients. Recently, a new version of a temporal artery thermometer for noninvasive core temperature measurements (TemporalScanner TAT-5000) was introduced with accuracy and precision advertised as being comparable to invasive core temperature measurements. In this study, we sought to determine if this new thermometer is an acceptable substitute for invasive bladder temperature measurement.
In 35 patients undergoing neurosurgical interventions and 35 patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit, measurements from the temporal artery thermometer were compared with those from a bladder thermometer. Four measurements were obtained from each patient.
Overall 280 measurement pairs were obtained. The mean bias between the methods was 0.07 degrees C +/- 0.79 degrees C; the limits of agreement were approximately 3 times greater than the a priori defined limit of +/-0.5 degrees C (-1.48 to 1.62). The sensitivity for detecting fever (core temperature >37.8 degrees C) using the temporal artery thermometer was 0.72, and the specificity was 0.97. The positive predictive value for fever was 0.89; the negative predictive value was 0.94. The sensitivity for detecting hypothermia (core temperature <35.5 degrees C) was 0.29, and the specificity was 0.95. The positive predictive value for hypothermia was 0.31, and the negative predictive value was 0.95.
The results of this study do not support the use of temporal artery thermometry for perioperative core temperature monitoring; the temporal artery thermometer does not provide information that is an adequate substitute for core temperature measurement by a bladder thermometer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17898385/

To date, there are few published studies on the role of computerized order sets or APS in improving the quality and safety of pediatric PCA use. This retrospective analysis sought to determine if the implementation of computerized order sets would increase appropriate monitoring and problem recognition.
Analysis included 536 patients prescribed PCA in one of three ways: an anesthesia order set with APS support (n = 285), a general PCA order set (n = 95), or no order set (n = 156). We analyzed the use of order sets by unit; the incidence of appropriate monitoring (> or =12 recordings within 24 h) of respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and sedation level and the recognition of low respiration rate and low oxygen saturation between the types of PCA order.
We found a significant difference in type of PCA order used by unit. Appropriate documentation of respiratory rate and oxygen saturation occurred significantly more often if the order set with APS was used. Low respiration rate was also recognized significantly more frequently (P < or = 05) in the APS order set group.
These findings show that use of a computerized PCA order set with monitoring requirements and an APS can increase monitoring and documentation of important vital signs and increase identification of potential negative events.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17897275/

Two private gastroenterology practices.
A total of 27,061 endoscopic procedures (14,856 EGDs and 12,205 colonoscopies) were prospectively assessed regarding patient characteristics, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status, dosage of propofol, fall of oxygen saturation below 90%, need to increase nasal oxygen administration above 2 L/min, and need for assisted ventilation.
Propofol was administered by the endoscopy nurse supervised by the endoscopist. Patient monitoring consisted of only pulse oximetry and clinical assessment.
The mean propofol dose for EGD was 161 mg (range 50-650 mg). During colonoscopy patients received a mean propofol dose of 116 mg (30-500 mg) in addition to 25 mg of meperidine. Oxygen saturation fell below 90% (lowest 74%) in 623 procedures (2.3%), normalizing within less than 30 seconds by stimulating the patient and increasing the nasal oxygen flow to 4 to 10 L/min.

Reserving repeated CT imaging for patients who harbor higher-risk lesions may reduce overall radiation exposure, the need for sedative agents, and cost.
The authors performed a retrospective cohort study in 268 patients younger than 18 years of age who underwent repeated CT scanning within 24 hours of their initial CT scanning procedure. The risk of progression between the initial and repeated CT scanning sessions and the need for delayed neurosurgical intervention were determined for each lesion type. In 54 patients (20.1%) the normal findings on the initial CT study did not change on subsequent imaging. In 61 (28.5%) of the 214 patients in whom abnormal findings were present on the initial scan, progression was demonstrated. Patients with epidural hematoma (EDH; odds ratio [OR] 12.29), subdural hematoma (SDH; OR 3.18), cerebral edema (OR 9.34), and intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH; OR 18.3) were found to be at a significantly increased risk for progression and to require delayed neurosurgical intervention (OR 11.91). No significantly increased risk was found for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), diffuse axonal injury (DAI), or skull fracture.
Repeated CT imaging in children with high-risk lesions such as EDH, SDH, cerebral edema, and IPH is recommended. However, in children with low-risk lesions, such as SAH, IVH, DAI, and isolated skull fractures but no sign of clinical deterioration, repeated imaging may be less likely to alter the clinical management scheme.

We report a case series on four pregnant women to address these concerns and outline their therapeutic approaches.
We reviewed four patients who underwent oral gastroduodenoscopy (OGD) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) during their pregnancies. Lead aprons were used to shield the foetuses in all patients that underwent ERCP. Sedation was given when necessary, and an anaesthetist was employed in one case for close patient monitoring. Fluoroscopy was minimised and radiographs were taken only when essential.
The mean patient age was 27.8 years (range 23-35 years). The mean gestation was 21.5 weeks (range 14-32 weeks), with two patients each being in their second and third trimesters. The indications for ERCP were cholangitis and pancreatitis (one), choledocholithiasis on ultrasonography (two), and that for OGD was persistent vomiting (one). Two patients underwent sphincterotomy and one had a biliary stent inserted. One patient was lost to follow-up. The other three had a full-term normal delivery and all babies were healthy at birth with good birth weight and normal Apgar scores.

According to the Institute of Medicine, recent technological advances in patient monitoring have contributed to substantially decreased mortality for people receiving general anesthesia in operating room settings. Patient safety has not been similarly targeted for the several million children annually in the United States who receive moderate sedation without endotracheal intubation. Critical event analyses have documented that hypoxemia secondary to depressed respiratory activity is a principal risk factor for near misses and death in this population. Current guidelines for monitoring patient safety during moderate sedation in children call for continuous pulse oximetry and visual assessment, which may not detect alveolar hypoventilation until arterial oxygen desaturation has occurred. Microstream capnography may provide an ""early warning system"" by generating real-time waveforms of respiratory activity in nonintubated patients.
The aim of this study was to determine whether intervention based on capnography indications of alveolar hypoventilation reduces the incidence of arterial oxygen desaturation in nonintubated children receiving moderate sedation for nonsurgical procedures.
We included 163 children undergoing 174 elective gastrointestinal procedures with moderate sedation in a pediatric endoscopy unit in a randomized, controlled trial. All of the patients received routine care, including 2-L supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Investigators, patients, and endoscopy staff were blinded to additional capnography monitoring. In the intervention arm, trained independent observers signaled to clinical staff if capnograms indicated alveolar hypoventilation for >15 seconds. In the control arm, observers signaled if capnograms indicated alveolar hypoventilation for >60 seconds. Endoscopy nurses responded to signals in both arms by encouraging patients to breathe deeply, even if routine patient monitoring did not indicate a change in respiratory status.
Our primary outcome measure was patient arterial oxygen desaturation defined as a pulse oximetry reading of <95% for >5 seconds. Secondary outcome measures included documented assessments of abnormal ventilation, termination of the procedure secondary to concerns for patient safety, as well as other more rare adverse events including need for bag-mask ventilation, sedation reversal, or seizures.
Children randomly assigned to the intervention arm were significantly less likely to experience arterial oxygen desaturation than children in the control arm. Two study patients had documented adverse events, with no procedures terminated for patient safety concerns. Intervention and control patients did not differ in baseline characteristics. Endoscopy staff documented poor ventilation in 3% of all procedures and no apnea. Capnography indicated alveolar hypoventilation during 56% of procedures and apnea during 24%. We found no change in magnitude or statistical significance of the intervention effect when we adjusted the analysis for age, sedative dose, or other covariates.
The results of this controlled effectiveness trial support routine use of microstream capnography to detect alveolar hypoventilation and reduce hypoxemia during procedural sedation in children. In addition, capnography allowed early detection of arterial oxygen desaturation because of alveolar hypoventilation in the presence of supplemental oxygen. The current standard of care for monitoring all patients receiving sedation relies overtly on pulse oximetry, which does not measure ventilation. Most medical societies and regulatory organizations consider moderate sedation to be safe but also acknowledge serious associated risks, including suboptimal ventilation, airway obstruction, apnea, hypoxemia, hypoxia, and cardiopulmonary arrest. The results of this controlled trial suggest that microstream capnography improves the current standard of care for monitoring sedated children by allowing early detection of respiratory compromise, prompting intervention to minimize hypoxemia. Integrating capnography into patient monitoring protocols may ultimately improve the safety of nonintubated patients receiving moderate sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16702250/
16569750,Does end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring detect respiratory events prior to current sedation monitoring practices?,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,2006,"Burton JH, Harrah JD, Germann CA, Dillon DC","The value of ventilation monitoring with end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) to anticipate acute respiratory events during emergency department (ED) procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) is unclear. The authors sought to determine if ETCO2 monitoring would reveal findings indicating an acute respiratory event earlier than indicated by current monitoring practices.
The study included a prospective convenience sample of ED patients undergoing PSA. Clinicians performed ED PSA procedures with generally accepted patient monitoring, including oxygen saturation (SpO2), and clinical ventilation assessment. A study investigator recorded ETCO2 levels and respiratory events during each PSA procedure, with clinical providers blinded to ETCO(2) levels. Acute respiratory events were defined as SpO2 < or =92%, increases in the amount of supplemental oxygen provided, use of bag-valve mask or oral/nasal airway for ventilatory assistance, repositioning or airway alignment maneuvers, and use of physical or verbal means to stimulate patients with depressed ventilation or apnea, and reversal agent administration.
Enrollment was stopped after independent review of 20 acute respiratory events in 60 patient sedation encounters (33%). Abnormal ETCO2 findings were documented in 36 patients (60%). Seventeen patients (85%) with acute respiratory events demonstrated ETCO2 findings indicative of hypoventilation or apnea during PSA. Abnormal ETCO2 findings were documented before changes in SpO2 or clinically observed hypoventilation in 14 patients (70%) with acute respiratory events.
Abnormal ETCO2 findings were observed with many acute respiratory events. A majority of patients with acute respiratory events had ETCO2 abnormalities that occurred before oxygen desaturation or observed hypoventilation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16569750/

Twenty-four non-anaesthetist participants with high or low levels of musical training were trained to monitor visual and auditory displays of patients' vital signs. In nine anaesthesia test scenarios, participants were asked every 50-70 s whether one of five vital signs was abnormal and the trend of its direction. Abnormality judgements were unaffected by music or musical training. Trend judgements were more accurate when music was playing (p = 0.0004). Musical participants reported trends more accurately (p = 0.004), and non-musical participants tended to benefit more from music than did the musical participants (p = 0.063). Music may provide a pitch and rhythm standard from which participants can judge changes in vital signs from auditory displays. Nonetheless, both groups reported that it was easier to monitor the patient with no music (p = 0.0001), and easier to rely upon the auditory displays with no music (p = 0.014).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16229691/

Researchers are investigating displays that integrate information and that, in some cases, also deliver the results continuously to the anesthesiologist. Integrated visual displays reveal higher-order properties of patient state and speed in responding to events, but their benefits under an intensely timeshared load is unknown. Head-mounted displays seem to shorten the time to respond to changes, but their impact on peripheral awareness and attention is unknown. Continuous auditory displays extending pulse oximetry seem to shorten response times and improve the ability to timeshare other tasks, but their integration into the already noisy operative environment still needs to be tested. We reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of the three approaches, drawing on findings from other fields, such as aviation, to suggest outcomes where there are still no results for the anesthesia context. Proving that advanced patient monitoring displays improve patient outcomes is difficult, and a more realistic goal is probably to prove that such displays lead to better situational awareness, earlier responding, and less workload, all of which keep anesthesia practice away from the outer boundaries of safe operation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15976225/

In addition to the operative challenges, postoperative disorders in the cardiovascular system, tissue oxygenation, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and pulmonary embolism expose the patient to severe risks.
From 1997-2002 we operated on ten patients with giant ventral incisional or umbilical hernia (mean defect size 240 cm(2)) by using retromuscular polypropylene mesh. All patients were morbidly obese [mean Body Mass Index (BMI) 39+/-7.2 kg/m(2)]. Four of the operations were emergencies because of an acute intestinal occlusion, bowel gangrene, and skin complications. The patients were reinvestigated after the mean follow-up of 2.5 years to find out the frequency of recurrence and degree of disability.
There was no intraoperative mortality, but one patient died at home after 5 weeks because of myocardial infarct and prolonged wound infection. She had mild stable coronary heart disease preoperatively. Although minor wound complications were observed in three patients, there was no need to remove the meshes. One small recurrent hernia was observed in the follow-up, but it was too small to be repaired. The quality of life after surgery was good for all patients, and they were satisfied with the operation. Retromuscular mesh hernioplasty associated with careful patient monitoring in intensive care is safe and feasible in the selected patients with massive ventral hernia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15549498/

Attention has been focussed on patients undergoing abdominal aneurysm aortic (AAA) surgery with combined anaesthesia (epidural and light general). Awake correlation was found between maximum value of Pas time derivative, max (dPas/dt), and CO measured with thermodilution method on 56 measurements on 10 patients. To evaluate further diagnostic capability of max (dPas/dt), we compare its trend with other parameters but no statistical significant results have been obtained.

To characterize the intraoperative monitoring practices of Mohs surgeons and examine the relationship between changes in vital signs during skin surgery and the incidence of serious adverse events.
We surveyed a group of Mohs surgeons and prospectively measured blood pressure, pulse, and pulse oximetry of 100 patients undergoing repair of Mohs surgery defects under local anesthesia in the outpatient clinic setting.
The majority of survey respondents utilize no intraoperative monitoring, and serious adverse events are rare (0.2 per 1000 procedures performed). Moderate fluctuations in our patients' vital signs occurred (<10% deviation from baseline); however, all measured variables returned to near baseline by procedure end and were not associated with any serious adverse events.

Because morbidity and mortality have been associated with benzodiazepines in endoscopic sedation, safer alternatives were sought. Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol), a rapid and short-acting anesthetic, initially used in the 1980's for general anesthesia induction and maintenance, is a promising candidate.
This review article examines experiences and literature references of propofol's use in endoscopic procedures. Three critical questions are posed: What are the major advantages and potential risks of propofol? When should propofol be used? Who should administer propofol, how should it be administered, and what type of monitoring is required?
With considerable inter-patient variability, the propofol dose must be carefully titrated according to the individual patient's response. Factors influencing dosage include age, ASA class, patient's height and procedure duration. Propofol's primary risk is its narrow therapeutic range which necessitates careful patient monitoring.
Propofol's advantages over benzodiazepines and narcotics include a more rapid onset of action, full relief of discomfort and rapid recovery to alertness without residual sedative effects or anterograde amnesia, thereby making this drug a cost-effective and, with proper monitoring, safe choice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14755149/

Propofol is currently under evaluation as an alternative to the combination of midazolam and meperidine for sedation during endoscopic procedures. The purpose of this study was to compare nurse-administered propofol to midazolam and meperidine for sedation in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing diagnostic upper GI endoscopy.
Twenty outpatients who had known chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh class A or B) and were undergoing variceal screening were randomized to receive propofol or midazolam plus meperidine for sedation. Administration of sedation was performed by a registered nurse and supervised by the endoscopist. Outcome measures studied were induction and recovery times, efficacy and safety of sedation, patient satisfaction, and return to baseline function.
The mean dose of propofol and meperidine/midazolam administered was 203 mg (SD 43.7, range 150-280) and 71.3 mg (SD 17.7, range 50-100)/5.3 mg (SD 0.9, range 3.0-6.0), respectively. The mean time to achieve adequate sedation was 3.6 min (SD 1.2) for the propofol group in comparison to 7.3 min (SD 2.8) for the meperidine/midazolam group (p<0.05). Procedure times between the groups were similar: propofol, 3.9 min (SD 1.9); midazolam/meperidine, 2.7 min (SD 0.8) (p=0.11). The level of sedation achieved by the propofol group was greater (p=0.0001). Time to full recovery was faster in the propofol group: 34.9 min (SD 10.3) versus 51.6 min (SD 18.4) (p<0.05). The mean time to reach a maximal level of alertness on the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale for the propofol group was 15 min (SD 3.6) versus 29 min (SD 10.5) (p=0.001). Although both groups recorded a high level of satisfaction, patients receiving propofol expressed greater overall mean satisfaction with the quality of their sedation at the time of discharge (p<0.05), and reported a return to baseline function sooner in the majority of cases. Propofol achieved comparable levels of efficacy and safety to meperidine/midazolam in our study group. Both were well tolerated with minimal complications.
Propofol sedation administered by registered nurses in the setting of adequate patient monitoring is efficacious and well tolerated in patients with liver disease who are undergoing variceal screening by upper endoscopy. Patients were more satisfied with the quality of sedation, and return to baseline function was usually sooner compared to results achieved with midazolam/meperidine.

This study compared the feasibility and tolerance of transnasal small-caliber (TSC-EGD) and peroral small-caliber EGD (PSC-EGD) with conventional EGD (C-EGD).
A total of 150 patients referred for diagnostic EGD were randomly allocated to undergo either TSC-EGD, PSC-EGD, or C-EGD under local anesthesia if they agreed to receive sedation only on demand or in case of intolerance. Patients, endoscopists, and nurses completed questionnaires on the tolerability and quality of the examinations using a visual analogue scale (VAS), ranging from 1 (best/nonexistent) to 10 (worst/unbearable) after EGD. Small-caliber EGD and C-EGD were performed with 5.9-mm and 9.8-mm video endoscopes (Olympus), respectively.
The patients' age, sex, experience with EGD, and anxiety before EGD did not differ significantly between the three groups, each consisting of 50 patients. TSC-EGD failed in four of the 50 patients (8 %) because of a narrow nasal tract; they underwent PSC-EGD. Complete examinations, including the second part of the duodenum and biopsy sampling, were possible in all patients. Patients examined with an ultrathin instrument required sedation significantly less often (TSC-EGD 6 %, PSC-EGD 18 %, C-EGD 44 %; P < 0.01) and consequently spent less time in the recovery room. TSC-EGD was initially more painful on insertion, but caused less gagging (P<0.01) than peroral EGD during the whole procedure. TSC-EGD caused mild epistaxis in one case.
TSC-EGD was carried out safely and completely in 92 % of the patients. TSC-EGD and PSC-EGD were better tolerated and required sedation less often than conventional EGD. Transnasal diagnostic EGD appears to be a promising alternative to peroral EGD, as it is associated with less gagging and a high level of patient satisfaction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12929057/

To the extent these many parameters are correlated and redundant, manually monitoring all of them may not be an optimal physician strategy for assessing patient state or predicting future changes to guide their actions.
The method is illustrated by application to seventy-six anesthetized patients for which thirty-two fundamental and derived variables were recorded at 20-second intervals. The Iterative Order and Noise estimation algorithm (ION) estimated the noise on each parameter. The performance of principal components analysis (PCA) was improved by normalizing the noise estimated by ION to unity. A linear regression of the resulting seven high signal-to-noise ratio principal components (PC's) predicted tachycardia 140 seconds in advance.
ION estimated the noise on each parameter with sufficient accuracy to increase the number of significant PC's from two to seven, all of which had identifiable physiological correlates. The resulting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) suggested that a 70 percent prediction rate with 5 percent false alarms could be achieved.
This paper illustrates the use of ION to improve significantly the performance of PCA in the efficient representation of patient state and in improving the performance of linear predictors of clinically significant parameters.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12885179/

Endoscopic procedures for which NAPS is (or is not) recommended are listed, and a profile of patients for whom NAPS is contraindicated is given. Steps toward the development of programs and acquisition of training in NAPS are recommended; these include determining what state, local, and institutional laws apply to propofol administration; developing a written protocol; and instituting a training program that proceeds from observation to supervised administration to independent administration of propofol, with appropriate monitoring of safety records. Experience with NAPS using bolus titration (dosage, timing, coadministration with other agents) is detailed, and proper patient monitoring is discussed.

American volume,2002,"Miller SL, Cleeman E, Auerbach J, Flatow EL","Acute anterior glenohumeral dislocations have been commonly treated with closed reduction and the use of intravenous sedation. Recently, the use of intra-articular lidocaine has been advocated as an alternative to sedation, since intravenous access and patient monitoring are not required. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of local anesthesia compared with that of the commonly used intravenous sedation during the performance of a standardized reduction technique.
In a prospective, randomized study, skeletally mature patients with an isolated glenohumeral joint dislocation and no associated fracture were randomized to receive either intravenous sedation or intra-articular lidocaine to facilitate reduction of the dislocation. Reduction was performed with the modified Stimson method. The two groups were compared with regard to the rate of successful reduction, pain as rated on a visual analog scale, time required for the reduction, time from the reduction until discharge from the emergency department, and cost.
Thirty patients were enrolled in the study. Five (two in the lidocaine group and three in the sedation group) required scapular manipulation in addition to the Stimson technique to reduce the dislocation. The lidocaine group spent significantly less time in the emergency department (average time, seventy-five minutes compared with 185 minutes in the sedation group, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to pain (p = 0.37), success of the Stimson technique (p = 1.00), or time required to reduce the shoulder (p = 0.42). The cost of the intravenous sedation was $97.64 per patient compared with $0.52 for use of the intra-articular lidocaine.
Use of intra-articular lidocaine to facilitate reduction with the Stimson technique is a safe and effective method for treating acute shoulder dislocations in an emergency room setting. Intra-articular lidocaine requires less money, time, and nursing resources than does intravenous sedation to facilitate reduction with the Stimson technique.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12473699/

These deaths (n = 119; 15%) were further analysed to identify contributing aspects of the anaesthetic management, other factors and the appropriateness of care. The incidence of 24-h peri-operative death per 10 000 anaesthetics was 8.8 (95% CI 8.2-9.5), of peri-operative coma was 0.5 (0.3-0.6) and of anaesthesia-related death 1.4 (1.1-1.6). Of the 119 anaesthesia-related deaths, 62 (52%) were associated with cardiovascular management, 57 (48%) with other anaesthetic management, 12 (10%) with ventilatory management and 12 (10%) with patient monitoring. Inadequate preparation of the patient contributed to 30 (25%) of the anaesthesia-related deaths. During induction of anaesthesia, choice of anaesthetic technique (n = 18 (15%)) and performance of the anaesthesiologist (n = 8 (7%)) were most commonly associated with death. During maintenance, the most common factors were cardiovascular management (n = 43 (36%)), ventilatory management (n = 12 (10%)) and patient monitoring (n = 12 (10%)).

Monitoring of patients undergoing sedation and pain control, particularly where the patient is at risk for respiratory, ventilatory, oxygenation or hemodynamic changes from the influence of pharmacological agents, which suppress respiration, is vital to the patient's safety. Many such clinical situations occur in settings where standard monitoring equipment is not available or access to the patient and equipment is limited. Monitoring should not be limited to intermittent manual observation. Among the noninvasive methods of patient monitoring, several parameters can provide continuous information on the respiratory effort and subsequent ventilation and oxygenation status of the patient. The paramedics' ability to use, interpret and act upon the data derived from the patient assessment and monitoring technology will help ensure a positive outcome for the patient. Promoting patient comfort and reducing or eliminating pain are the responsibilities of all prehospital clinicians, while at the same time ensuring patient safety.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11680220/
11252101,Perioperative management of cosmetic liposuction.,Plastic and reconstructive surgery,2001,"de Jong RH, Grazer FM","Recent qualms about the safety of aesthetic lipoplasty may be attributable more to support system flaws than to technical process deficiencies. The authors here focus on perfunctory patient monitoring when sedative or analgesic drugs are given, cavalier infiltration of mega-dose lidocaine, cursory intraoperative patient observation by team members with conflicting responsibilities, anesthesia providers unfamiliar with the unique surgical physiology of liposuction, hurried-discharge policies that virtually ignore the residual depressant effects of sedatives and analgesics, and compressive dressings that impair postoperative chest-wall expansion and venous return. Whereas pulmonary embolism remains the leading process cause of morbidity from liposuction, complications from austere resource allocation to dedicated patient monitoring should be largely preventable. Not all lipoplasties require an anesthesia provider but-when heavy sedation, mega-dose lidocaine, or both, are projected-a trained team member dedicated exclusively to patient safety and comfort should be a minimum patient care standard. The potential role of lidocaine cardiotoxicity in tumescent anesthesia is widely underappreciated and that of hypothermia goes mostly unrecognized. These, plus largely preventable or potentially correctable perioperative events such as pulmonary edema, fluid imbalance, or improperly administered sedative and analgesic drugs, demand upgrading and expansion of monitoring, resuscitative, and recuperative facilities in physician offices. In fact, ASPS guidelines urge that anesthesia services be engaged for dedicated patient care whenever ""major"" liposuction or conscious sedation is projected, because liposuction is neither as benign nor as simple a procedure as heretofore reputed. To assess objectively the operative and anesthetic risk of obesity, document body mass index for the preoperative record; morbid obesity (body mass index >/= 35.0), for instance, is a known risk multiplier for sedatives and analgesics. Other system issues such as the dynamic profile of high-dose lidocaine pharmacokinetics, the deportation of fat globules in the bloodstream, and the incidence of intraoperative hypothermia remain as unresolved topics for interdisciplinary, multi-institutional clinical research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11252101/

10718389,Improved sedation in diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP: propofol is an alternative to midazolam.,Endoscopy,2000,"Jung M, Hofmann C, Kiesslich R, Brackertz A","Adequate sedation of the patient is required for diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The anesthetic propofol, with its shorter half-life, affording better control, offers an alternative to the benzodiazepine midazolam. The aim of this randomized, controlled, unblinded study was to compare prospectively the quality of sedation under propofol and midazolam in patients undergoing ERCP.
A total of 80 patients were randomized to sedation with propofol alone (n = 40) or midazolam alone (n = 40). Blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturation were measured. Midazolam was given by the endoscopist and titrated to the patients' response during ERCP, to a maximum dose of 15 mg per patient. In the propofol group an anesthetist was present to administer the propofol and to observe the patient. Standardized testing procedures (Steward score, Trieger test) were used to determine the length of postendoscopy recovery time. Efficacy of sedation was assessed by investigators and patients, using scoring systems.
Complete ERCP and adequate sedation was possible in 80% of patients (32 out of 40) with midazolam, and in 97.5% of patients (39 out of 40) with propofol (P<0.01). The average propofol induction dose was 1.24 mg/kg body weight, with maintenance requiring a mean dose of 9 mg/kg body weight per hour, or the equivalent of 354 mg in total. The average dose of midazolam administered was 0.12 mg/kg body weight; the total dose averaged 8 mg. Recovery time in the propofol patients was significantly shorter (P<0.01). The investigators (P<0.01) and the patients (P<0.05) both judged the quality of sedation to be better in the propofol group. There were no differences in blood pressure, pulse, or oxygen saturation between the two groups. One patient in the propofol group (79 years old) suffered a protracted apneic phase accompanied by hypotension that was managed by manual ventilation and drug therapy, and led to no complications.
Propofol proves to be an excellent sedative for ERCP and shows a shorter recovery time than midazolam. Because of the narrow therapeutic window, we recommend close patient monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10718389/

A field block was administered only at and distal to the level of the tarsometatarsal joints using 30 cc equal parts 0.25% bupivacaine and 1% lidocaine without epinephrine. Before injection, the monitoring anesthesiologist gave the patient intravenous (IV) sedation, usually an amnestic agent. Narcotic analgesia was not given to any patient before or during surgery to evaluate the efficacy of the block. Detailed records were kept of all intraoperative medication and its dosage, including supplemental local anesthetic. Efficacy and outcome were measured via direct patient monitoring during surgery and by direct interview after surgery, first in the recovery area (visual pain analogue applied) and again at 24 to 48 hr after surgery (recollection of events, duration of block, use of narcotics after surgery, subjective patient satisfaction). Supplemental local anesthetic was required for 15 patients (primarily for those who underwent lesser toe procedures), IV narcotic was required for 3 patients, and conversion to general anesthesia was required for 4 patients for agitation, not pain. The average duration of the local block was 8 hr (range, 5-14 hr); none of the patients had recall of negative events, and overall patient satisfaction was 98%. Midfoot blocks are easy to administer and provide reliable anesthesia for reconstructive forefoot surgery.

A cross-sectional prospective study was carried out on 24 consecutive patients who were switched from oral morphine to oral methadone because they experienced substantial adverse effects that limited further increase in morphine dose. A fixed conversion morphine-to-methadone ratio of 5:1 was chosen. Subsequently, doses were changed according to clinical need, with frequent visits or phone contacts. Pain and symptom intensity, preswitching doses of morphine, initial and subsequent doses of methadone, and survival were recorded.
A significant decrease in pain and symptom intensity was found within 24 hours after the substitution took place. The switching was effective in most patients (19 of 24), although five patients required alternative treatments. No significant changes in methadone dose were reported in the 3 days after switching. Methadone dose was significantly higher in patients who had lower preswitching doses of morphine and vice versa. No relevant complications were reported.
A rapid substitution of morphine with methadone using an initial fixed ratio of 5:1 is a safe and effective method for improving the balance between analgesia and adverse effects in cancer patients with poor morphine response. An appropriate system of patient monitoring is necessary, because further changes in dose may be required according to clinical needs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10506634/

The short-acting anesthetic propofol offers certain potential advantages for endoscopic procedures, but controlled studies proving its superiority over benzodiazepines for ERCP are lacking.
During a 6-month period 198 consecutive patients undergoing routine ERCP randomly received either midazolam (n = 98) or propofol (n = 99) for sedation. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation) were continuously monitored and procedure-related parameters, the recovery time and quality (recovery score) as well as the patient's cooperation and tolerance of the procedure (visual analog scales) were prospectively assessed.
Patients receiving propofol or midazolam were well matched with respect to demographic and clinical data, ERCP findings, and the performance of associated procedures. Propofol caused a more rapid onset of sedation than midazolam (p < 0.01). Clinically relevant changes in vital signs were observed at comparable frequencies with temporary oxygen desaturation occurring (< 85 %) in 6 patients in the propofol group and 4 patients receiving midazolam (not significant). However, an episode of apnea had to be managed by mask ventilation via an ambu bag (lasting 8 minutes) in one of the patients receiving propofol sedation. Mean recovery times as well as the recovery scores were significantly shorter with propofol (p < 0. 01). Propofol provided significantly better patient cooperation than midazolam ( p < 0.01), but procedure tolerability was rated the same by both groups of patients (not significant).
Intravenous sedation with propofol for ERCP is (1) more effective than sedation with midazolam, (2) safe under adequate patient monitoring, and (3) associated with a faster postprocedure recovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10343208/

We compared transnasal (T-EGD) with peroral (P-EGD) unsedated endoscopy by using an ultrathin video instrument with respect to patient tolerance and acceptance.
Patients were randomized to T-EGD or P-EGD. If the initial route of insertion failed, the patient was crossed over to the other route. If this also failed, the patient underwent endoscopy under conscious sedation with an ultrathin instrument. A questionnaire for tolerance was completed by the patient (a validated 0-10 scale where ""0"" represents none/well tolerated and ""10"" represents severe/poorly tolerated).
Of 105 recruited patients, 60 consented to undergo unsedated endoscopy. There were 20 men and 11 women (mean age 45 years) in the P-EGD group and 15 men and 14 women (mean age 48 years) in the T-EGD group. Of 35 total P-EGD patients (4 were crossed over T-EGD patients), 34 (97%) completed an unsedated examination. Of 29 T-EGD patients, 25 (86%) had a complete examination. Three T-EGD examinations failed for anatomical reasons; all 3 patients when crossed over to the P-EGD route had a successful examination. One patient was unable to tolerate either route. Between the P-EGD and the T-EGD groups, pre-procedure anxiety (3.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.6), discomfort during insertion (2.1 +/- 0.5 vs 3.3 +/- 0.7), gagging (4.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.2 +/- 0. 6), and overall tolerance (2.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.7) were similar (p > 0.05).

The intraoperative MR system (MRT) is located in a specially modified operative suite that combines the features of an MR-imaging suite with a fully functional operating room. An MR-compatible anesthesia machine and patient-monitoring device are located next to the magnet. The position of instruments, platforms and supports may be mapped in the operative field using 3 charge-coupled device video cameras mounted in the overhead support truncheon that follow various light-emitting diodes on the devices (Pixsys). The MR image plane can be defined as the axial, coronal or sagittal views through a point along the vector beneath the Pixsys tripod. A variety of surface coils were designed to take full advantage of full open patient access. The software, implemented by a technologist located outside the MR room, is now equivalent to that available on the commercial 0.5-tesla Signa Advantage system. Development of very robust 3-dimensional software in conjunction with the Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL) at the Brigham & Women's Hospital is the subject of significant effort. The MRT system has been shown to possess imaging capabilities comparable, or even slightly superior (by 10%), to a conventional 0.5-tesla MR scanner. Two modified liquid-crystal display screens are mounted on the magnet housing for the surgeon to monitor the images during the procedures. Projection into larger screens or the operating microscope is under development.
We have performed 110 neurosurgical cases in MRT as of January 29, 1997, including 47 biopsies, 6 catheter placements, 4 cyst drainages, 47 craniotomies for resection, 3 spinal cases (1 syrinx drainage), and 3 laser tumor ablations.
MRT is especially useful in guiding biopsies and resections near cysts, ventricles and critical vascular structures where preoperative images with framed/frameless techniques would be inadequate to show anatomic changes during the procedure. Real-time images of a biopsy needle within the abnormal area are very useful in cases of subtle pathologic change. More complete resection of infiltrative tumor is readily accomplished. SPL image fusion of SPECT and neurofunctional data (e.g. from magnetic stimulation preoperatively) into the imaging space enables the surgeon to better visualize tumor invasion or neural function in real-time imaging during resection. Imaging of thermal gradients for cryoprobe or laser ablation, and combination with endoscopy and robotics will offer additional benefit in the performance of difficult neurosurgical procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9711689/

We placed the Paratrend 7-probe (BSL, High Wycombe, UK) in the left frontoparietal white matter and measured pO2 (ptiO2), pCO2 (pti CO2), pH and temperature while simultaneously measuring these parameters (pcvO2, pcvCO2) in the sagittal sinus in 7 pigs under general anaesthesia during a 100% oxygen enhancement. The relation between oxygen increase in brain tissue and in the sagittal sinus showed a coefficient of correlation (CCmean) r(mean) = 0.96. The quantitative response in brain tissue was much more sensitive than in the sinus. A close correlation between pCO2 in brain tissue and sagittal sinus and the increase of the inspired oxygen was seen: CC ptiCO2 to arterial oxygen pressure (paO2) - r(mean) = 0.67, CC pcvCO2 to paO2 - r(mean) = 0.88.

Among the most important points of fact we clarify in our paper are: 1. Three organizations that accredit, certify, and govern nurse anesthetists are organized in similar fashion to three comparable bodies governing anesthesiologists. There is no justification for the implication that the AANA somehow controls the accreditation and certification of CRNAs. 2. The conclusion that anesthesiologistled care teams are the preferred model for all anesthesia services and settings because of improved patient outcomes is overly simplistic and is not borne out in the literature. 3. The attribution of reduced mortality from anesthesia over the past 40 years to the increase in numbers of anesthesiologists is not justified. Many other factors, including new anesthetic agents and improved patient monitoring, also are important. 4.

Level One Trauma Anesthesia Simulation.,Human factors,1996,"Xiao Y, Hunter WA, Mackenzie CF, Jefferies NJ, Horst RL","To elicit components of task complexity in emergency medical care, a study was conducted to contrast one medical procedure with two levels of task urgency in trauma patient resuscitation. Videotapes of actual resuscitation were reviewed to extract task characteristics of the procedure. Two levels of urgency were compared in the following areas: patient status, technical difficulty of tasks, the amount of available patient monitoring information, and the pace of work. Four components of task complexity in emergency medical care were identified: multiple and concurrent task, uncertainty, changing plans, and compressed work procedures and high workload. These components of task complexity pose challenges to team functions and can lead to problems in team coordination, such as conflicts in goals, tasks, and access to the patient. Training to increase explicit communications and improvements in the design of work procedures are necessary in order to meet the challenges of task complexity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8976626/

Retrospective review of 607 consecutive peripheral arterial and venous angioplasties, stents, thrombolytic cases, and inferior vena caval filters in 446 patients was analyzed for immediate success rate, complication rate, and 1-year life table patency rate.
The incidence of initial technical success was: aorta, 89%; iliac artery, 91%; superficial femoral artery, 90%; popliteal artery, 91%; tibial arteries, 79%; arm arteries and veins, 86%; renal arteries, 100%; IVC filters, 98%; and iliofemoral veins, 100%. The 1-year primary patency rates, including technical failures, were 70.3% in 113 femoropopliteal procedures and 83.7% in 194 iliac arteries. Advantages to the use of the operating room included: (1) simultaneous angioplasty during a bypass operation for abnormalities proximal or distal to the graft, (2) correction of lesions first discovered during thrombectomy, and (3) optimum patient monitoring and sedation in the operating room.
Endovascular procedures performed by vascular surgeons in the operating room lead to results comparable with procedures performed in nonsurgical interventional suites, and the use of the operating room has advantages.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8808957/

In three healthy patients some periods of remarkable hypoxia was detected and those cases are reported in this paper. Two of the patients were treated by a surgical operation and one patient underwent large conservative dental treatment under sedation because of dental care phobia. During the dental treatment period external oxygen was added for all these three patients to avoid more complications as a result of hypoxia. Two of the patients received an injection of benzodiazepine antagonist, too. One patient needed further follow up but non of these patients developed any additional complications.

The increased use of this modality has prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics to develop national guidelines that emphasize the need for patient monitoring to ensure patient safety. A policy was developed that incorporated continuous monitoring of patients and frequent documentation of physiological measures before, during, and after procedures. All procedures over a 2-month period in the outpatient (n = 19) and inpatient (n = 24) pediatric oncology units that required midazolam and fentanyl were retrospectively analyzed. A nonrandom sample of one third of the inpatient procedures (n = 8) was also observed to assess the dynamics of monitoring and recording. Procedures, including recovery time, lasted an average of 69 minutes, with longer recovery periods recorded for the outpatient unit. Nurses, particularly on the inpatient unit, were not always able to provide continuous monitoring through recovery because of the demands of other patient assignments.

The adjustment usually is made in the hospital or office 5 to 24 hours after surgery, when the patient has fully recovered from general anesthesia. The ability to perform suture adjustment in the operating room, immediately after completion of surgery, would be an attractive alternative with respect to patient monitoring, sterility, comfort, and timing. The purpose of this study is to compare the alignment of patients in the operating room adjusted immediately after surgery with their alignment the morning after surgery.
Patients with strabismus who have good vision in each eye and who were judged to be appropriate candidates for adjustable sutures were invited to enroll in a study using propofol and mivacurium total intravenous anesthetic technique. Patients underwent strabismus surgery in which one or more muscles were placed on adjustable sutures. Immediately after extubation, these patients were awakened in the operating room, assisted in sitting upright, and asked to fixate on a 20/400 Snellen E target on the operating room wall. Sutures were adjusted, when necessary, to obtain the desired postoperative alignment. Prism and alternate cover measurements, taken after the sutures were permanently tied, were compared with measurements taken the morning after surgery.
Twenty-nine patients qualified for inclusion. Measurements of horizontal and vertical alignment in the operating room were all within 12 prism diopters (PD) of the measurements taken 18 to 24 hours after surgery (mean variation, 4 PD horizontally and 2 PD diopters vertically). The measured deviation changed less than or equal to 6 PD horizontally in 78% of patients and less than or equal to 3 PD vertically in 70% of patients.
For some adult patients with strabismus, a total intravenous general anesthesia technique using an infusion of propofol and mivacurium may provide the opportunity for accurate suture adjustment in the operating room, immediately after completion of surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7831026/

Some investigators have recommended empiric shunting for patients presumed to be at higher risk for cerebral ischemia with a recent stroke or severe stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery.
Carotid endarterectomy was performed in 81 cases with cervical block anesthetic, monitoring the awake patient for the development of cerebral ischemia (unresponsiveness or paralysis) during carotid clamping. The need for shunting (based on awake response) was compared in patients with the arbitrarily defined empiric indications for shunting (n = 29) versus those who did not have such clinical or anatomic findings (n = 52).
Cerebral ischemia requiring shunting was observed in five (17.2%) of 29 cases with the defined indications for empiric shunting. This was not different than the need for shunting in the control group where cerebral ischemia was seen in eight (15.4%) of 52 cases. No intraoperative neurologic events occurred in any case, but one (1.2%) patient suffered a postoperative transient ischemia attack and another (1.2%) had a postoperative stroke.
Empiric clinical or anatomic indications for shunting were not reliable predictors of cerebral ischemia that developed during carotid clamping in this study.

Alternative principles can be grouped into those detecting the respiratory effort, and those detecting the actual result, i.e. the respiratory gas flow. The second category is of greatest interest for patient monitoring. In this paper, we report the development and initial clinical experience with a new acoustic air-flow sensor. By differential, multipoint detection of the air-flow in the mouth and nose region, the sensor can easily discriminate against different kinds of interference, including motion artefacts. The sensor is nonexpensive, rugged, simple to apply and inherently safe. An instrument with continuous display of respiratory rate, and an audiovisual apnea alarm has been designed and built. The complete system has been tested on patients during recovery after general anesthesia. In 16 patients, the respiratory rate displayed by the instrument has been correlated against that visually observed. A good correlation was obtained. Minor discrepancies can be explained from the fact that visual observation corresponds to the respiratory effort, whereas the sensor detects the actual air flow. In 12 patients, 24 hour simultaneous recordings were made of respiratory rate with the new sensor, with simultaneous recording of the oxygen saturation and the heart rate with a pulse oximeter. It was found that the new sensor reliably recorded respiratory depression and apnea. Such events may in some patients be as frequent as one incident per hour.

The system is based on remote auscultation of heart sounds and respiratory sounds using specially developed pickup heads that are positioned on the precordium or at the nostrils and connected to microphones via polymer tubing. The microphones operate in a differential mode outside the strong magnetic field to reduce various sources of interference from the MRI equipment. After amplification, the signal is transmitted as infrared light to a small, battery-operated receiver and a headphone set. Thus, the patient can be simultaneously auscultated both inside and outside the shielded MRI room by infrared transmission through a metal mesh window. Bench tests of the system show that common mode acoustic noise is suppressed by approximately 30 dB in the frequency region of interest (100-1,000 Hz), and that polymer tubing having a diameter of approximately 2 mm can be used for efficient sound transmission. Recordings in situ show satisfactory detection of both heart sounds and respiratory sounds, although the signal is somewhat masked by noise during imaging.

The epidural space is located between the dura mater (the outer-most membrane surrounding the spinal cord) and the vertebral canal. The site of catheter placement is determined by the dermatomes corresponding to the site of desired analgesia. The primary factors that differentiate epidural narcotics are related to their pharmacokinetic profiles. Morphine, which is hydrophilic, has a slower onset of action and a longer duration of analgesia than lipophilic compounds such as fentanyl; morphine also results in less segmentalization (the degree to which analgesia is limited to discrete dermatomal segments corresponding to the level of the epidural narcotic injection) than is seen with lipophilic compounds. Studies have shown that epidural narcotics provide superior pain relief compared with systemic narcotics. Common adverse effects associated with therapeutic doses of intraspinal narcotics include itching, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, and sedation; respiratory depression is uncommon after epidural administration of narcotics. The most bothersome adverse effect encountered with analgesic doses of local anesthetics is paresthesia. Solutions for epidural administration must be sterile and preservative free. Epidural administration of narcotics and local anesthetics seems to provide better pain relief than conventional methods but may be associated with more bothersome adverse effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1746584/

2047291,New advances in anesthesia.,The Nursing clinics of North America,1991,"Waugaman WR, Foster SD","Pharmacologic advances in anesthesia over the last decade have focused on drug safety, shorter durations of action, reversibility, and ease of administration. This is reflective of major changes in the focus of patient care from inpatient to outpatient settings as well as from available risk management data that support the investigation of these new drugs. The pharmacologic advances discussed included those drugs in current practice as well as experimental drugs yet to be released for general clinical use. Inhaled agents, such as isoflurane and perhaps the experimental agent, desflurane, will maintain or achieve their popularity because of the relative ease of administration and wide margins of safety. Propofol, the most recent intravenous anesthetic available for clinical use, has already gained wide acceptance because of its dual function as an induction and maintenance agent and its appropriateness for use in the ambulatory surgical population. The role of midazolam in anesthesia practice has increased to such an extent that it has largely supplanted the use of diazepam (Valium). The introduction of the antagonist, flumazenil, will undoubtedly enhance the safety and efficacy of midazolam as well as broaden its applicability of use across various patient populations. Several of the newer synthetic narcotics, such as alfentanil and sufentanil, have replaced other narcotics formerly used in anesthesia practice, such as meperidine and morphine, primarily because of their short action and lack of significant side effects. The use of muscle relaxants as a critical component of anesthetic management has led to the development of a number of new drugs in this classification. Pharmacologic management of patients under anesthesia will at some future date likely include the administration of alpha 2 agonists. Administration of these drugs can reduce anesthetic requirements of traditional agents by as much as 50%. As research continues, new drugs will be incorporated into the practice of anesthesia, ones that will promote rapid uptake, low toxicity, intense analgesia, easy reversibility, shorter durations, and fewer side effects. One measure of success relative to pharmacologic development in anesthesia is the recent and dramatic decreases in patient morbidity and mortality figures over the last decade. This attests to the rapid growth and development of not only improved patient monitoring systems but also newly improved ""agents of sleep.""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2047291/

Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Drug treatments consisted of 4-day regimens of 1 mg alprazolam four times daily, 60 mg fluoxetine every morning, 1 mg alprazolam four times daily and 60 mg fluoxetine every morning, and placebo four times daily. Psychomotor performance, mood status, and degree of sedation were evaluated at designated times. Combined administration of alprazolam and fluoxetine resulted in an approximate 30% increase in plasma alprazolam concentrations relative to plasma concentrations following the administration of alprazolam alone. There were no significant differences in fluoxetine or norfluoxetine plasma concentrations between the alprazolam/fluoxetine and fluoxetine treatments. Psychomotor decrements increased when fluoxetine was administered with alprazolam relative to alprazolam administration alone. Psychomotor performance of the fluoxetine treatment group was not significantly different from that of the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in mood status, and sedation was minimal in all treatment groups. As when any two psychoactive drugs are administered together, increased patient monitoring and patient education is recommended when alprazolam and fluoxetine are prescribed concurrently.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1924640/
1653142,The safety and tolerability of sumatriptan: an overview.,European neurology,1991,"Brown EG, Endersby CA, Smith RN, Talbot JC","Safety information was pooled from 4,859 patients, mainly treated in controlled clinical trials with a dispersible tablet of sumatriptan or by a subcutaneous injection, and from 1,164 patients who received placebo by these routes. Safety monitoring involved collection of all adverse events, regardless of their relationship to treatment, and included routine laboratory screening tests and some special investigations. Individuals experienced several groups of symptoms that might be considered to be features of migraine itself or of the post-migraine period or due to treatment. The commonest complaints were an unpleasant taste or pain on injection. After oral sumatriptan (100-300 mg), some events (nausea, malaise) were characteristic of migraine and others (fatigue, sedation, weakness) were characteristic of the recovery period. With subcutaneous sumatriptan (4-8 mg) similar events were observed, but certain distinctive symptoms variously described as heaviness, pressure sensation, tingling, feelings of heat or warmth, were more common and affected various parts of the body. Their early onset and transient nature suggests some pharmacological mechanism, as yet not identified. Despite the mixed picture of symptoms recorded after treatment, they were not serious, they were transient and they were accepted by patients. Close patient monitoring allowed detailed evaluation of any possible cardiovascular side-effects as seen with other anti-migraine agents, particularly ergotamine. The evidence is reassuring but, since experience in patients with symptomatic ischaemic heart disease is limited, it is recommended that they should initially be treated with sumatriptan under medical supervision for their first two or three attacks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1653142/
2188709,Nerve blocks in the critical care environment.,Critical care clinics,1990,"Rung GW, Marshall WK","The critical care patient population has much to gain from properly administered neural blockade. Effective analgesia alone may make the difference between a patient who is able to compensate for their acute insult and one who cannot. A good example is the patient with multiple fractured ribs, who, after intercostal nerve blocks, no longer requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. The authors believe that effective analgesia is just the beginning of the beneficial effects of neural blockade, because blockade of the afferent limb of sympathetic and sensory nerves may circumvent the neuroendocrine response to acute injury. There is evidence that the stress response is not beneficial in the hospital setting and in fact may be detrimental. Some of the effects include elevated plasma catecholamines, ADH, cortisol, and blood glucose, which contribute to tachycardia, hypertension, increased myocardial work and oxygen consumption, salt and water retention, and a catabolic state with negative nitrogen balance. Whether these changes result in reduced morbidity and mortality has been the subject of several studies, but more studies are needed. It would seem that critically ill patients with little physiologic reserve might be the best population to study because even a small improvement may improve survival. A small beneficial effect in healthy postoperative patients may not be clinically apparent. Most would agree that neural blockade used intraoperatively results in reduced blood loss and a lower incidence of postoperative thromboembolism. The continuation of these techniques into the postoperative period may reduce morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients. A word of caution is in order. The indiscriminate application of the techniques described in this article to critically ill patients would not be in the patients' best interest. Nerve blocks are only safe in the hands of those physicians specifically trained to perform them. In addition, local anesthetics have a low therapeutic ratio, and their administration requires continual observation. The use of epidural or intrathecal opioids alone or in combination with other agents also has potentially serious side effects, and requires continual patient monitoring. The proper performance and maintenance of these techniques requires a large commitment of time, manpower, equipment, and a multidisciplinary approach to include physicians, nursing, and support staff. Nerve blocks and other sophisticated techniques started in the operating room or critical care unit should not necessarily be discontinued when the patient is transferred to a ward bed because the full benefit of this therapy may not have been fully realized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2188709/

When the respiratory parameters measured with the same system and inspiratory oxygen concentration are in normal range adequate cellular oxygen supply is furthermore dependent on the following factors that influence oxygen delivery (DO2) to the tissue: the general factors, oxygen transport capacity of the blood and cardiac output and (local factors) distribution of tissue perfusion (including e.g. local occlusion, sludging, steal syndrome). In critically ill patients general impairment of oxygen delivery might occur as well as maldistribution. Studies were performed in experimental animals and patients to get some insight into the cardiovascular implementations of these respiratory measurements. Oxygen delivery has been manipulated (in pigs) by sodium nipride infusion (drop of blood pressure and cardiac output) to critical levels of oxygen supply. Endotoxin was infused with typical hemodynamic changes (first, hyperdynamic phase with increase of pulmonary artery pressure, decrease of mean arterial pressure and increase of cardiac output and, second, hypodynamic phase with low cardiac output). VO2 and oxygen delivery were controlled in a patient with a ruptured aneurysm, with impairment of oxygen transport capacity due to low hemoglobin but maintained circulating volume.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2260423/
2729688,The safety of fentanyl use in the emergency department.,Annals of emergency medicine,1989,"Chudnofsky CR, Wright SW, Dronen SC, Borron SW, Wright MB","Fentanyl citrate is a synthetic narcotic 1,000 times as potent as meperidine. It produces minimal hemodynamic effects and is characterized by a rapid onset of sedation and analgesia, a relatively short duration of action (approximately 30 to 40 minutes), and rapid reversal with opiate antagonists. These properties make fentanyl an ideal drug for emergency department use. The safety of fentanyl use in an adult ED population has not previously been studied. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 841 patients who received fentanyl at the University of Cincinnati Center for Emergency Care between January 1985 and June 1988. The study population included 497 (59%) men and 344 (41%) women, with an average age of 33 years. The average dose of fentanyl was 180 micrograms (range, 25 to 1,400 micrograms). Six patients (1%) experienced mild side effects including nausea (one), emesis (two), urticaria (one), and pruritus (two). Nine patients (1%) developed more serious complications including six cases (0.7%) of respiratory depression and three cases (0.4%) of hypotension. Two of 183 patients (1%) who received midazolam and two of nine patients (22%) who received haloperidol developed respiratory depression. Four of the six patients with respiratory depression and two of the three patients with hypotension were intoxicated. All of the complications were transient, and none resulted in hospitalization. We conclude that fentanyl is a safe drug for use in the ED.
