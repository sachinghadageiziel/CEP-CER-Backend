38258587,Effect of Air Polishing on the Treatment of Peri-Implant Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,The Journal of oral implantology,2023,"Bi J, Khoshkam V, Hunter M, Cho C, Kar K","Peri-implant diseases have become one of the notable biological complications of postrehabilitation with implant-supported restorations. Effective modalities for decontamination of biofilm deposits around implant surfaces are critical for resolution of the inflammation. Air polishing is one of the recommended clinical methods for treating peri-implant diseases. This systematic review assessed clinical evidence on efficacy of using air polishing technology for the management of peri-implant diseases, including peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis. Four electronic databases from January 1990 to December 2022 were searched to identify the relative human randomized clinical trials that applied air polishing for nonsurgical and surgical treatment of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis. Twelve articles were selected. For treating peri-implant mucositis, air polishing showed a comparable effect to ultrasonic scaling in the reduction of bleeding on probing (BOP) and probing pocket depth (PPD). The nonsurgical approach of air polishing in treating peri-implantitis varied in the reduction of BOP, PPD, and clinical attachment level (CAL) in evaluated studies. Air polishing in the surgical treatment of peri-implantitis was comparable to mechanical cleaning, implantoplasty, and the use of Ti-brush, in regards to the significant reduction of BOP, PPD, and CAL, as well as the improvement of the bone level between baseline and follow-ups. The standardized mean difference with a 95% confidence interval of the studied parameters was estimated using the random effect model; however, statistical differences were not detected between air polishing and comparative modalities in the treatment of peri-implantitis. Within the limitations of this review, the application of air polishing did not result in more favorable outcomes in the treatment of peri-implant diseases compared to other modalities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38258587/
36918345,In vitro efficacy of non-surgical and surgical implant surface decontamination methods in three different defect configurations in the presence or absence of a suprastructure.,Clinical implant dentistry and related research,2023,"Korello K, Eickholz P, Zuhr O, Ratka C, Petsos H","Analysis of the in vitro efficacy of non-surgical and surgical dental implant surface decontamination with or without suprastructure.
Three hundred and sixty implants were dipped in indelible red and distributed to 30°, 60°, or 90° angulated bone defect models. One hundred and twenty implants were used for each bone defect, 40 of which were assigned to a decontamination method (CUR: curette; SOSC: soundscaler; APA: air powder abrasion). Of these, 20 were subjected to a simulated non-surgical (NST) or surgical treatment (ST), with/without mucosa mask, of which 10 were carried out with (S+) or without (S-) suprastructure. Uncleaned implant surface was assessed by both-sided implant surface photography. Surface morphology changes were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Cleaning efficacy was significantly better within NST if the suprastructure was removed (p < 0.001). No significant difference was found within ST (p = 0.304). Overall, cleaning efficacy in the order APA > SOSC>CUR decreased significantly (p < 0.0001) for both S+ and S- in NST as well as ST. Separated by NST/ST, S+/S-, defect angulation and decontamination method, only isolated significant differences in cleaning efficacy were present. Linear regression analysis revealed significant associations of remnants with the treatment approach, decontamination method, and defect angle (p < 0.0001). SEM micrographs showed serious surface damage after use of CUR and SOSC.
Suprastructure removal is an additional option to improve cleaning efficacy of non-surgical implant surface decontamination in this in vitro model.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36918345/
36754733,Cleaning methods of contaminated zirconia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials,2023,"Thammajaruk P, Guazzato M, Naorungroj S","The aims of this study were to systematically review the literature and statistically analyze the effectiveness of different cleaning methods on the bond strength of resin cement to zirconia in short- and long-term aging conditions.
The literature was electronically searched in PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, Wiley, Scopus, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations databases to select relevant articles that evaluated the bond strength between contaminated zirconia and resin cements. A manual search was performed by scanning the reference lists of included studies.
All articles were published online before April 2022 and in English. Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD) between uncontaminated zirconia and various cleaning methods in two aging conditions (short- and long-term). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I-square statistics. The risk of bias of all included studies was assessed. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
Of the 1181 studies, 25 studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analyses. In short-term aging condition, cleaning contaminated zirconia with water, alcohol, or acid etching reported significantly lower bond strength than uncontaminated zirconia. For long-term aging condition, cleaning contaminated zirconia with water, cleaning agents, alcohol, or acid etching reported significantly lower bond strength than uncontaminated zirconia. Alumina air-abrasion or cleaning with sodium hypochlorite were comparable to uncontaminated zirconia for both short- and long-term aging conditions.
This meta-analysis appeared to indicate that the cleaning methods of contaminated zirconia restoration have an effect on zirconia bonding.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36754733/

35235623,Titanium Surface Decontamination: A Systematic Review of In Vitro Comparative Studies.,The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants,2022,"Francis S, Iaculli F, Perrotti V, Piattelli A, Quaranta A","To achieve high plaque removal around peri-implant tissues, noninvasive cleaning methods that guarantee the long-term success and survival of titanium implants should be established. This systematic review aimed to systematically evaluate in vitro investigations assessing different treatment modalities to decontaminate titanium surfaces, with special focus on the most effective cleaning procedures.
PRISMA guidelines were adopted in an electronic search conducted through MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases to identify studies on mechanical, chemical, or laser decontamination modalities up to November 2019.
The search resulted in 326 articles; after removing duplicates and reading titles, abstracts, and full texts, 38 articles were ultimately processed for data extraction. Mechanical decontamination provided better results in comparison to laser and chemical procedures. Among mechanical modalities, air abrasion showed the best cleaning effectiveness. Conversely, upon comparison of the chemical methods, chlorhexidine demonstrated comparable results with all tested substances and even with photodynamic therapy. Among different lasers, the results showed that the diode was more promising compared with the other tested lasers.
This review demonstrated that there is still no consensus on which technique performs better. However, mechanical decontamination yielded more favorable results than laser and chemical methods. This aspect would support the hypothesis that decontamination procedures adopted in a combination fashion, which includes mechanical procedures, may provide better clinical results than when used alone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35235623/
33358017,Novel technique using cold atmospheric plasma coupled with air-polishing for the treatment of titanium discs grown with biofilm: An in-vitro study.,Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials,2021,"Hui WL, Ipe D, Perrotti V, Piattelli A, Fang Z, Ostrikov K, Quaranta A","The aim of the present study was to assess the decontamination efficacy and titanium surface alterations of erythritol based air abrasion (AA) and cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) targeting a human complex biofilm.
Saliva collected from a peri-implantitis patient was used to develop in vitro human biofilm over titanium discs with machined (group A) and moderately rough (group B) surface. The discs were treated with AA, experimental CAP or a combination of both treatments (COM). The amount of biofilm on the discs was measured by crystal violet (CV). Surface features and roughness before and after treatment were assessed by SEM and laser profilometry, respectively. The data were statistically analyzed using Kruskal Wallis followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test after being checked for normality by Shapiro-Wilk test.
All the discs in group A performed better to treatments compared to group B. In both groups, CV data showed significantly lower amount of biofilm after AA treatment compared to CAP (p<0.05). Cleaning efficacy revealed relevant decontamination of both the surfaces following AA and COM treatments and almost complete biofilm removal after AA application on group A (99.92%). SEM analysis demonstrated no post-treatment alterations on the discs and laser profilometry did not show statistically significant changes in S
Decontamination with AA delivering erythritol with or without CAP is highly effective in biofilm removal from different titanium surfaces. All the tested treatments, including CAP showed no noticeable alterations of the titanium discs surface features. Further in vivo studies are necessary to understand the potential of CAP technology in implant surface decontamination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33358017/
32436905,Comparative evaluation of occlusal pits and fissures morphology modification techniques before application of sealants: An,Indian journal of dental research : official publication of Indian Society for Dental Research,2020,"Singh A, , Patil V, Juyal M, Raj R, Rangari P","Pits and Fissures are recognized as being highly susceptible to caries. Pit and fissure sealants are one of the best methods of preventing caries as it occludes the fissures and pits from the accumulation of plaque and cariogenic microflora. There are different methods of cleaning and preparing occlusal pits and fissures for preventing caries which helps in alleviating oral health status of paediatric population.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the microleakage of pit and fissure sealants after using five different preparation techniques, namely: A) Conventional technique using pumice prophylaxis, B) enameloplasty with round carbide bur, C) enameloplasty with fissurotomy bur, D) air polisher, and E) air abrasion.
The study was conducted on 50 caries-free premolars extracted for orthodontic purpose. These teeth were randomly assigned to five groups, 10 teeth in each for receiving fissure sealant after different surface preparation; thermocycling and sectioning of samples were performed and microleakage was assessed under a stereomicroscope after methylene blue dye immersion.
The results of air abrasion groups were significantly superior with ""0"" microleakage when compared to all other groups followed by round bur, fissurotomy bur, air polisher and pumice prophylaxis.
To improve the marginal adaptation of the sealants, minimally invasive methods are the most favoured methods of occlusal preparation. This study promises to show positive results for fissure sealants which are likely to play an important role in caries prevention and techniques that are intended to protect caries susceptible surfaces.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32436905/
