38401098,"Effect of Breathing Meditation Training on Nursing Work Quality, Occurrence Risk of Adverse Events, and Attention Level of Operating Room Nurses.",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,2024,"Xu L, Jia J, Hou S, Dou Z, Song R","To explore the effect of breathing meditation training on nursing work quality, occurrence risk of adverse events, and attention level of operating room nurses.
Taking the starting time of breathing meditation training of operating room nurses in our hospital in July 2020 as the dividing line, operating room nurses who implemented routine management from April 2020 to June 2020 were selected as the control group (n=30), and operating room nurses who carried out breathing meditation training from July 2020 to September 2020 were included in the intervention group (n=30). The emotional state [Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score], Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) score, electrocardiogram indicators (blood pressure, pulse, and respiration), electroencephalogram indicators (SMR wave, β wave, and θ wave EEG frequency), attention level (attention quotient, visual attention, and auditory attention), nursing work quality (health education, theoretical knowledge, nursing operation, and operating room management) and the number of reported adverse events were compared between the two groups before and after training.
After breathing meditation training, the intervention group's Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores were significantly reduced (P < .05), while the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) score was significantly increased (P < .05). ). In addition, blood pressure and respiratory rate were reduced in the intervention group (P < .05), with significant differences compared with the control group (P < .05). The SMR waves and beta waves in the intervention group increased (P < .05), while theta waves decreased (P < .05). Attention quotient, visual attention and auditory attention scores were improved in the intervention group compared with the control group (P < .05). The scores of health education, theoretical knowledge, nursing operations and operating room management of the intervention group after training were higher than those of the control group (P < .05). The intervention group reported a lower number of adverse events than the control group (74.42% vs. 25.58%). The application of breathing meditation training in special training for operating room nurses can effectively relieve negative emotions, enhance mindfulness scores, reduce blood pressure and respiratory rate, regulate brain wave frequency, improve attention status and quality of nursing work, and reduce the risk of adverse events. These outcomes may have a positive impact on improving the quality of nursing practice and patient care in the operating room. For operating room nurses, the negative emotional stress caused by sustained high levels of mental concentration may affect work efficiency and the entire surgical process. Breathing meditation training can enhance nurses' emotional resilience, thereby improving the efficiency and safety of operating room care.
The application of breathing meditation training in the special training of operating room nurses can effectively alleviate negative emotions, enhance the mindfulness score, reduce blood pressure and respiratory rate, regulate brain wave frequency, improve the attention state and nursing work quality, and reduce the occurrence risk of adverse events. Future research should conduct longitudinal studies to evaluate the long-term effects of breathing meditation training on the quality of nursing work and the prevention of adverse events. Additionally, research could explore advanced neuroimaging techniques to gain structural insights, integrate meditation into existing training programs, tailor interventions for different healthcare settings, assess patient outcomes, explore technology-assisted meditation, and investigate interprofessional collaboration. Through these pathways, a more complete understanding of the impact and best integration of breath meditation in healthcare settings can be achieved, providing valuable insights into improving the well-being of healthcare professionals and potentially overall patient care and satisfaction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38401098/
37851153,Quantitative electroencephalogram in term neonates under different sleep states.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2024,"Yuan I, Georgostathi G, Zhang B, Hodges A, Kurth CD, Kirschen MP, Huh JW, Topjian AA, Lang SS, Richter A, Abend NS, Massey SL","Electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used to assess depth of consciousness, but interpreting EEG can be challenging, especially in neonates whose EEG undergo rapid changes during the perinatal course. EEG can be processed into quantitative EEG (QEEG), but limited data exist on the range of QEEG for normal term neonates during wakefulness and sleep, baseline information that would be useful to determine changes during sedation or anesthesia. We aimed to determine the range of QEEG in neonates during awake, active sleep and quiet sleep states, and identified the ones best at discriminating between the three states. Normal neonatal EEG from 37 to 46 weeks were analyzed and classified as awake, quiet sleep, or active sleep. After processing and artifact removal, total power, power ratio, coherence, entropy, and spectral edge frequency (SEF) 50 and 90 were calculated. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the QEEG in each of the three states. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess discriminatory ability of QEEG. 30 neonates were analyzed. QEEG were different between awake vs asleep states, but similar between active vs quiet sleep states. Entropy beta, delta2 power %, coherence delta2, and SEF50 were best at discriminating awake vs active sleep. Entropy beta had the highest AUC-ROC ≥ 0.84. Entropy beta, entropy delta1, theta power %, and SEF50 were best at discriminating awake vs quiet sleep. All had AUC-ROC ≥ 0.78. In active sleep vs quiet sleep, theta power % had highest AUC-ROC > 0.69, lower than the other comparisons. We determined the QEEG range in healthy neonates in different states of consciousness. Entropy beta and SEF50 were best at discriminating between awake and sleep states. QEEG were not as good at discriminating between quiet and active sleep. In the future, QEEG with high discriminatory power can be combined to further improve ability to differentiate between states of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37851153/

The aim of the present study was to address the hypothesis that increased interhemispheric cortical synchronization in PD is related to dopamine deficiency and is correlated with motor function.
We studied participants with PD and characterized cortical synchronization with reference to brain regions. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 20 participants with PD while OFF and ON their dopaminergic medications (two separate visits), during quiet standing and straight-line walking. Cortical interactions in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma brain wave frequency bands were evaluated using interhemispheric phase synchronization (inter-PS).
Inter-PS values were found to be significantly higher during the OFF state as compared to the ON state in standing and walking trials for theta, alpha and beta bands. In addition, inter-PS reduction from OFF to ON was associated with mobility improvement evaluated by the Timed Up and Go test, and with daily levodopa equivalent dose across individuals. Higher differences in inter-PS values between OFF and ON states were evident mainly in the occipital-parietal cortex.
Persons with PD have increased inter-PS during the OFF state compared to their ON state, and this increase in inter-PS is associated with the clinical improvement between OFF and ON. We speculate that these findings, together with previous evidence of higher inter-PS in PD as compared to healthy older adults, reflect neuronal processes consequential to asymmetric subcortical dopamine deficiency.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35299069/
32691283,Modelling the PSI response in general anesthesia.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2021,"Pérez GA, Pérez JAM, Álvarez ST, Morales JAR, Fragoso AML","In anesthesia automation, one of the main important issues is the availability of a reliable measurement of the depth of consciousness level (hypnosis) of the patient. According to this value, the hypnotic drug dosage can be adequately calculated. One of the most studied hypnosis indexes is the bispectral index (BIS). In this article we analyzed an alternative called patient state index (PSI). The objectives of this study are, first, to validate the accuracy of the PSI describing the hypnosis level during the maintenance phase of general anesthesia, by comparing with the BIS and, second, to model the relationship between propofol infusion rate and PSI values, obtained from a SEDLine monitor. For this, real data from patients undergoing general anesthesia simultaneously monitored with both BIS and PSI signals was used. Results obtained are interesting for a correct interpretation of PSI signal in clinical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32691283/
32151241,Retrospective analysis of cases of intraoperative awareness in a large multi-hospital health system reported in the early postoperative period.,BMC anesthesiology,2020,"Deis AS, Schnetz MP, Ibinson JW, Vogt KM","Awareness with recall under general anesthesia remains a rare but important issue that warrants further study.
We present a series of seven cases of awareness that were identified from provider-reported adverse event data from the electronic anesthesia records of 647,000 general anesthetics.
The low number of identified cases suggests an under-reporting bias. Themes that emerge from this small series can serve as important reminders to anesthesia providers to ensure delivery of an adequate anesthetic for each patient. Commonalities between a majority of our identified anesthetic awareness cases include: obesity, use of total intravenous anesthesia, use of neuromuscular blockade, and either a lack of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring or documented high depth of consciousness index values. An interesting phenomenon was observed in one case, where adequately-dosed anesthesia was delivered without technical issue, processed EEG monitoring was employed, and the index value suggested an adequate depth of consciousness throughout the case.
Provider-reported adverse event data in the immediate post-operative period are likely insensitive for detecting cases of intraoperative awareness. Though causation cannot firmly be established from our data, themes identified in this series of cases of awareness with recall under general anesthesia provide important reminders for anesthesia providers to maintain vigilance in monitoring depth and dose of anesthesia, particularly with total intravenous anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32151241/
31665174,Nonlinear dynamics captures brain states at different levels of consciousness in patients anesthetized with propofol.,PloS one,2019,"Eagleman SL, Chander D, Reynolds C, Ouellette NT, MacIver MB","The information processing capability of the brain decreases during unconscious states. Capturing this decrease during anesthesia-induced unconsciousness has been attempted using standard spectral analyses as these correlate relatively well with breakdowns in corticothalamic networks. Much of this work has involved the use of propofol to perturb brain activity, as it is one of the most widely used anesthetics for routine surgical anesthesia. Propofol administration alone produces EEG spectral characteristics similar to most hypnotics; however, inter-individual and drug variation render spectral measures inconsistent. Complexity measures of EEG signals could offer better measures to distinguish brain states, because brain activity exhibits nonlinear behavior at several scales during transitions of consciousness. We tested the potential of complexity analyses from nonlinear dynamics to identify loss and recovery of consciousness at clinically relevant timepoints. Patients undergoing propofol general anesthesia for various surgical procedures were identified as having changes in states of consciousness by the loss and recovery of response to verbal stimuli after induction and upon cessation of anesthesia, respectively. We demonstrate that nonlinear dynamics analyses showed more significant differences between consciousness states than spectral measures. Notably, attractors in conscious and anesthesia-induced unconscious states exhibited significantly different shapes. These shapes have implications for network connectivity, information processing, and the total number of states available to the brain at these different levels. They also reflect some of our general understanding of the network effects of consciousness in a way that spectral measures cannot. Thus, complexity measures could provide a universal means for reliably capturing depth of consciousness based on EEG changes at the beginning and end of anesthesia administration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31665174/
27840633,Spectral Gini Index for Quantifying the Depth of Consciousness.,Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2016,"You KJ, Noh GJ, Shin HC","We propose indices that describe the depth of consciousness (DOC) based on electroencephalograms (EEGs) acquired during anesthesia. The spectral Gini index (SpG) is a novel index utilizing the inequality in the powers of the EEG spectral components; a similar index is the binarized spectral Gini index (BSpG), which has low computational complexity. A set of EEG data from 15 subjects was obtained during the induction and recovery periods of general anesthesia with propofol. The efficacy of the indices as indicators of the DOC was demonstrated by examining Spearman's correlation coefficients between the indices and the effect-site concentration of propofol. A higher correlation was observed for SpG and BSpG (0.633 and 0.770, resp.,",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27840633/
16794892,"The effect of addition of nitrous oxide to a sevoflurane anesthetic on BIS, PSI, and entropy.",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2006,"Soto RG, Smith RA, Zaccaria AL, Miguel RV","N(2)O is a commonly used anesthetic that has amnestic and analgesic properties. Recently, devices that estimate depth of consciousness have been introduced in an attempt to better titrate anesthesia, however the effect of N(2)O on these monitors is unclear.
General anesthesia was induced and titrated to maintain normal blood pressure and pulse in healthy adults. Data were collected in three 10 minute intervals (Sevo, Sevo + N(2)O, Sevo). In Phase A, sevoflurane concentration was held constant during the N(2)O trial in 60 subjects monitored with either BIS, PSI, or Entropy. In Phase B, sevoflurane concentration was reduced as N(2)O was added, maintaining a constant overall ""MAC"" in 20 subjects monitored concurrently with BIS and Entropy. Sample size for both phases was designed to detect a 10 unit change in measure of processed EEG with alpha = .05 and statistical power = .80.
In Phase A, supplementing sevoflurane with > 65% N(2)O increased MAC from 1.3 +/- 0.05 to 2.2 +/- 0.10, but did not significantly alter BIS nor PSI (p-value for differential MAC is < 0.05). Entropy, however, dropped significantly, with a change in state entropy (SE) from 31.1 +/- 7.3 to 18.9 +/- 3.7 and a corresponding rise when N(2)O was discontinued. In Phase B, supplementing sevoflurane with > 65% N(2)O with a concomitant reduction in sevoflurane resulted in an increase in both BIS (from 34 +/- 5 to 53.9 +/- 11.5) and SE (from 32 +/- 8.2 to 55.4 +/- 21.3).
Supplementing sevoflurane with > 65% N(2)O did not result in a significant change in either BIS or PSI when sevoflurane concentration was kept constant. Entropy, however, significantly decreased as anesthetic depth increased. When sevoflurane concentration was reduced during N(2)O administration, both BIS and Entropy rose despite maintenance of anesthetic depth, indicating a variable concentration effect between volatiles and N(2)O.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16794892/
16602568,Quantifying cortical activity during general anesthesia using wavelet analysis.,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2006,"Zikov T, Bibian S, Dumont GA, Huzmezan M, Ries CR","This paper reports on a novel method for quantifying the cortical activity of a patient during general anesthesia as a surrogate measure of the patient's level of consciousness. The proposed technique is based on the analysis of a single-channel (frontal) electroencephalogram (EEG) signal using stationary wavelet transform (SWT). The wavelet coefficients calculated from the EEG are pooled into a statistical representation, which is then compared to two well-defined states: the awake state with normal EEG activity, and the isoelectric state with maximal cortical depression. The resulting index, referred to as the wavelet-based anesthetic value for central nervous system monitoring (WAV(CNS)), quantifies the depth of consciousness between these two extremes. To validate the proposed technique, we present a clinical study which explores the advantages of the WAV(CNS) in comparison with the BIS monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, MA), currently a reference in consciousness monitoring. Results show that the WAV(CNS) and BIS are well correlated (r = 0.969) during periods of steady-state despite fundamental algorithmic differences. However, in terms of dynamic behavior, the WAV(CNS) offers faster tracking of transitory changes at induction and emergence, with an average lead of 15-30 s. Furthermore, and conversely to the BIS, the WAV(CNS) regains its preinduction baseline value when patients are responding to verbal command after emergence from anesthesia. We conclude that the proposed analysis technique is an attractive alternative to BIS monitoring. In addition, we show that the WAV(CNS) dynamics can be modeled as a linear time invariant transfer function. This index is, therefore, well suited for use as a feedback sensor in advisory systems, closed-loop control schemes, and for the identification of the pharmacodynamic models of anesthetic drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16602568/

We investigated 26 patients undergoing laminectomy. Investigated states of anesthesia were: awake, loss of response, loss of eyelash reflex, steady-state anesthesia, first reaction, and extubation during emergence. NT, BIS, spectral edge frequency, median frequency, relative power in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and hemodynamics were recorded simultaneously. The ability of all variables to distinguish between awake versus loss of response, awake versus loss of eyelash reflex, awake versus steady-state anesthesia, steady-state anesthesia versus first reaction and extubation were analyzed with the prediction probability. Effects of remifentanil during propofol infusion were investigated with Friedman's and post hoc with Wilcoxon's test. Only NT and BIS were able to distinguish all investigated states accurately with a prediction probability >0.95. After start of remifentanil infusion, only hemodynamics changed statistically significantly (P < 0.05). NT and BIS are more reliable indicators for the assessment of anesthetic states than classical electroencephalographic variables and hemodynamics, whereas the analgesic potency of depth of anesthesia could not be detected by NT and BIS.
The modern electroencephalographic monitoring systems Narcotrend and Bispectral Index are more reliable indicators for the assessment of anesthetic states than classical electroencephalographic and hemodynamic variables to predict anesthetic conditions from before induction of anesthesia until extubation during a standardized anesthetic regime with propofol and remifentanil.

14996266,Depth of consciousness and deep sedation attained in children as administered by nonanaesthesiologists in a children's hospital.,Paediatric anaesthesia,2004,"Motas D, McDermott NB, VanSickle T, Friesen RH","Sedation of children is administered by nonanaesthesiologists in a variety of locations within our children's hospital. The purpose of this study was to assess the depth of sedation administered to children in four locations using the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS).
Eighty-six children under the age of 12 years undergoing procedures with conscious or deep sedation were enrolled. The study included patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, computerized tomography imaging, gastrointestinal endoscopy, and dental procedures. Sedation for each procedure was based on departmental protocols and preferences; the study did not dictate choice or dose of drugs. An independent observer applied the UMSS sedation scale at 10 min intervals for 1 h. The observer and the personnel administering sedation were blinded to the BIS score, which was recorded continuously.
The goal of either conscious or deep sedation was attained in 53% (BIS) and 72% (UMSS) of patients. Depth consistent with general anaesthesia was observed in 35% (BIS) and 0% (UMSS), and an awake state was observed in 12% (BIS) and 28% (UMSS). About 8% of patients experienced desaturation and airway events associated with deeper levels of sedation.
Our data demonstrate wide variations in depth of sedation attained in the hospital. The goal of either conscious or deep sedation was not achieved in a significant number of children. This is a therapeutic failure that requires reassessment of sedation protocols and investigation of new approaches.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14996266/
12598252,"Changes in consciousness, conceptual memory, and quantitative electroencephalographical measures during recovery from sevoflurane- and remifentanil-based anesthesia.",Anesthesia and analgesia,2003,"Muncaster ARG, Sleigh JW, Williams M","It is unclear whether opioid-induced changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) or auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) reliably correspond with consciousness. We examined the correlation between 1) the clinically assessed state of consciousness, 2) implicit and explicit memory (by use of word pairs), and 3) various measures of EEG and AEP-bispectral index (BIS), A-Line ARX AEP index, spectral entropy, and entropy of the singular value decomposition (SVDEN; a measure of the complexity of the EEG). We studied 21 women during a two-stage awakening (sevoflurane washout followed by remifentanil washout) after anesthesia for gynecological surgery. All were amnesic, and 19 were unresponsive to verbal command with remifentanil alone. In six patients, BIS decreased paradoxically as the remifentanil concentration decreased; this was caused by a low-amplitude EEG, which was misinterpreted by the Aspect algorithm as burst suppression. Most of the EEG/AEP variables were sensitive to the decrease in sevoflurane and the recovery of consciousness, but not to the effects of decreasing remifentanil concentrations. SVDEN was the only variable that demonstrated significant increases for both the sevoflurane and remifentanil washout phases. With the prediction probability statistic during remifentanil washout, SVDEN = 0.79, spectral entropy = 0.81, A-Line ARX AEP index = 0.63, and BIS = 0.58. Entropy measures appear to be worthy of further clinical evaluation in a larger series of patients. SVDEN may be a useful variable for assessing anesthetic and analgesic effects on the central nervous system.
During the recovery phase from a remifentanil-based anesthetic, the bispectral index is not reliably predictive of the depth of consciousness, because of suppression ratio artifacts. Entropy measures of the electroencephalogram show promise, but there is still no gold standard to estimate anesthetic depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12598252/
10535328,Hypothesized neural dynamics of working memory: several chunks might be marked simultaneously by harmonic frequencies within an octave band of brain waves.,Brain research bulletin,1999,Glassman RB,"The capacity of working memory (WM) for up to about seven simple items holds true both for humans and other species, and may depend upon a common characteristic of mammalian brains. This paper develops the conjecture that each WM item is represented by a different brain wave frequency. The binding-by-synchrony hypothesis, now being widely investigated, holds that the attributes of a single cognitive element cohere because electroencephalogram (EEG) synchrony temporarily unifies their substrates, which are distributed among different brain regions. However, thought requires keeping active more than one cognitive element, or WM ""chunk,"" at a time. If there is indeed a brain wave frequency code for cognitive item-representations that are copresent within the same volume of neural tissue, the simple mathematical relationships of harmonies could provide a basis for maintaining distinctness and for orderly changes. Thus, a basic aspect of music may provide a model for an essential characteristic of WM. Music is a communicative phenomenon of ""intermediate complexity,"" more highly organized than the firing patterns of individual neurons but simpler than language. If there is a distinct level of neural processing within which the microscopic physiological activity of neurons self-organizes into the macroscopic psychology of the organism, it might require such moderate complexity. Some of the obvious properties of music--orderly mixing and transitions among limited numbers of signal lines-are suggestive of properties that a dynamic neural process might need in order to organize and reorganize WM markers, but there are a number of additional, nonobvious advantageous properties of summating sinusoids in music-like relationships. In particular, harmonies register a stable periodic signal in the briefest possible time. Thus, the regularity of summating sinusoids whose frequencies bear harmony ratios suggests a particular kind of tradeoff between parallel and serial processing. When there are few copresent waves, at EEG frequencies, this sort of parallel coding retains behaviorally meaningful brief periods. A necessary companion hypothesis is that the brain wave frequencies underlying WM are confined to a single octave; that is, the upper and lower bounds of the band are in the ratio of 2:1. This hypothesized restriction, suggested by an empirical property of EEG bands that has been widely reported but rarely commented upon, has the important property of precluding spurious difference rhythms. A restriction to an octave, of ""harmonious"" frequency-markers for WM items, also seems consistent with a great deal of behavioral data suggesting that WM comprises a rapidly fading trace process in which only up to three or four item-representations are strongly activated simultaneously. There is also an additional, sequential renewal-or-revision process, within which up to another three or four items are being actively refreshed by rehearsal or replaced. Such serial processing may involve a less stringent octave band crowding problem.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10535328/
2606068,Reciprocal relationship between the major EEG rhythms and latencies of evoked potential intermediate components. A tentative explanation.,Electromyography and clinical neurophysiology,1989,Liberson WT,"We recently demonstrated that there is a reciprocal relationship between the known brain wave rhythms (delta, 3.3 c/sec, 5 c/sec, theta, alpha, spindle, and beta) on the one hand, and the averaged evoked potential mid component latencies, on the other. In other words, the latter are closely related to the periods of the known brain wave frequencies. In this paper we offer a hypothetical explanation of this puzzling relationship, by assuming the following: 1) Whenever the fastest component of a sensory signal reaches the cortex it depresses EEG except for those waves of different frequencies which at that very instant exhibit a high amplitude peak of a preferential polarity. One half period later, different in real time for each brain wave frequency, high amplitude peaks will emerge from the record with opposite polarity to that which was preferential at the time of the signals' arrival. These segmental peaks are the same as those that express evoked potential components of mid latencies. For the somatosensory evoked potentials the time of occurrence of these peaks are defined by the following expression: (Formula; see text) where N is equal to successive numbers between 1 and 12, as well as to the fractions of 1; 20 msec is the moment of arrival of the fastest signal to the cortex. Some of the latencies correspond to the arrival of the delayed components of the somatosensory signals. Some correspond to the time of arrival of the auditory and visual signals, in an apparent expectation of multi-sensory signals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2606068/
