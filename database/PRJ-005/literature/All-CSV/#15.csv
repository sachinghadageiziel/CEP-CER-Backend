38901489,Comparing Bispectral Index Monitoring vs Clinical Assessment for Deep Sedation in the ICU: Effects on Delirium Reduction and Sedative Drug Doses-A Randomized Trial.,Chest,2024,"Huespe I, Giunta D, Acosta K, Avila D, Prado E, Sanghavi D, Bisso IC, Giannasi S, Carini FC","Sedative overdoses pose a risk of delirium among patients in the ICU, with potential mitigation through the use of a processed EEG monitor (the bispectral index [BIS]) to guide depth of sedation.
Can BIS-guided deep sedation (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale [RASS] score, -4 or -5) reduce sedative dosage and increase delirium-free and coma-free (DFCF) days?
A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary mixed ICU, enrolling patients requiring deep sedation for > 8 h. Patients were assigned randomly to either the clinical assessment (CA) or BIS groups (BIS range, 40-60). Both groups used a BIS sensor, whereas the CA group's screen remained covered. After deep sedation, BIS sensors were removed, and delirium was assessed twice daily by researchers masked to the randomization. The primary outcome was the number of DFCF days within 14 days after deep sedation. Additionally, we compared doses of sedative drugs and BIS values during deep sedation.
Ninety-nine patients were included in the study. We found no significant difference in DFCF days (P = .1) between CA and BIS arms, but propofol doses were significantly lower in the BIS group (CA group, 1.77 mg/kg/h [95% CI, 1.60-1.93] vs BIS group, 1.44 mg/kg/h [95% CI, 1.04-1.83]; P = .03). During deep sedation, the CA group spent 46% of the total hours (95% CI, 35%-57%) with BIS values of < 40, whereas the BIS group spent 32% (95% CI, 25%-40%; P = .03).

We compared a TS-L-TAPB (266 mg bupivacaine), which was performed bilaterally at the beginning and end of surgery, with two retrospective cohorts. These were patients who had undergone a TEA (ropivacaine/sufentanil) or an OS-L-TAPB (200 mg ropivacaine) at the beginning of surgery. Oral and i.v. opiate requirements were documented over the first 3 postoperative days (POD).

38114941,Comparison of post-auricular and frontal bispectral index values obtained during renal surgeries.,BMC anesthesiology,2023,"Abdelrahman AMF, Elbadry AA, Omara AF","The bispectral index (BIS) monitor is one of the EEG-derived monitoring techniques and well-established devices used to measure the depth of anesthesia. This study aimed to assess the agreement of BIS values based on the positions of either post-auricular or frontal sensors in individual patients undergoing renal surgeries while lateral positions at various stages of anesthesia.
12 patients older than 18 years, ASA I-III patients scheduled for elective renal operations, two BIS were placed on each patient, one on each side of the post-auricular region and one across the forehead, and each sensor was connected to a different BIS monitor. We gathered three pieces of data at each of the six-time points: BIS score, signal quality index (SQI) score calculating the signal's strength and electromyography (EMG) score: before the onset of anesthesia (awake) when the eyelash reflex is lost (LOC), after intubation (intubation), following the initial surgical incision, each 30 min throughout the procedure (maintenance), and at the moment the patient's eyes open naturally after waking up from anesthesia (emergence).
The overall BIS value at the frontal position was significantly higher than the post-auricular position (52.5 ± 22.2 and 52.1 ± 22.1, respectively, P = 0.010). On the other hand, the BIS value was comparable between the frontal and post-auricular positions at LOC, intubation, 60, 120, and 80 min and at emergence. A strong link between the two sensor positions, as indicated by the correlation coefficient (r = 0.607, P < 0.001), and the Bland-Altman analysis revealed a small mean difference (-1.8) and a low (9.0/- 12.5) limit of agreement, with just 4.3% of the readings falling outside of it during the anesthetic maintenance period.
Acceptable variation in BIS data was observed when obtained from the two different sensor positions for clinical usage. The post-auricular BIS sensor system may be a suitable substitute for an impractical frontal setup.

We included randomised controlled trials including older adults that evaluated the effect of anesthetic depth on postoperative delirium from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. We considered deep anesthesia as observer's assessment of the alertness/ sedation scale (OAA/S) of 0-2 or targeted bispectral (BIS) < 45 and the light anesthesia was considered OAA/S 3-5 or targeted BIS > 50. The primary outcome was incidence of POD within 7 days after surgery. And the secondary outcomes were mortality and cognitive function 3 months or more after surgery. The quality of evidence was assessed via the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach.
We included 6 studies represented 7736 patients aged 60 years and older. We observed that the deep anesthesia would not increase incidence of POD when compared with the light anesthesia when 4 related studies were pooled (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.63-3.08, P = 0.41, I

We designed this pilot study to assess the feasibility of comparing dexmedetomidine with normal saline during light versus deep anesthesia on POD in older patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery.
In this pilot randomized factorial study, 80 patients aged 60 years or older undergoing major noncardiac surgery were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive dexmedetomidine infusion 0.5 μg/kg/h or normal saline placebo during light (bispectral index [BIS] target 55) or deep (BIS target 40) anesthesia. Feasibility end points included consent rate and dropout rate, timely enrollment, blinded study drug administration throughout surgery, no inadvertent unmasking, achieving BIS target throughout >70% of surgery duration, and the process of twice-daily POD screening. In addition, we estimated the POD incidences in the 2 control groups (placebo and deep anesthesia) and treatment effects of dexmedetomidine and light anesthesia.
Between November 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022, 78 patients completed the trial (mean [standard deviation, SD] age, 69.6 [4.6] years; 48 male patients [62%]; dexmedetomidine-deep, n = 19; dexmedetomidine-light, n = 20; placebo-deep, n = 19; placebo-light, n = 20). This study had a high consent rate (86%) and a low dropout rate (2.5%). Average recruitment was 5 patients at each center per month. Dexmedetomidine and normal saline were administered in a blinded fashion in all patients. Unmasking did not occur in either group. Approximately 99% of patients received the scheduled study drug infusion throughout the surgery. Approximately 81% of patients achieved the BIS targets throughout >70% of the surgery duration. The scheduled twice-daily POD screening was completed without exception. Overall, 10 of the 78 patients (13%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7%-22%) developed POD. For the 2 reference groups, POD was observed in 7 of the 39 patients (17.9%; 95% CI, 9%-32.7%) in the placebo group and 7 of the 38 patients (18.4%; 95% CI, 9.2%-33.4%) in the deep anesthesia group. Regarding the treatment effects on POD, the estimated between-group difference was -10% (95% CI, -28% to 7%) for dexmedetomidine versus placebo, and -11% (95% CI, -28% to 6%) for light versus deep anesthesia.

37803259,Effect of raw electroencephalogram-guided anesthesia administration on postoperative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing abdominal major surgery: a randomized controlled trial.,BMC anesthesiology,2023,"He Z, Zhang H, Xing Y, Liu J, Gao Y, Gu E, Zhang L, Chen L","EEG monitoring techniques are receiving increasing clinical attention as a common method of reflecting the depth of sedation in the perioperative period. The influence of depth of sedation indices such as the bispectral index (BIS) generated by the processed electroencephalogram (pEEG) machine to guide the management of anesthetic depth of sedation on postoperative outcome remains controversial. This research was designed to decide whether an anesthetic agent exposure determined by raw electroencephalogram (rEEG) can influence anesthetic management and cause different EEG patterns and affect various patient outcomes.
A total of 141 participants aged ≥ 60 years undergoing abdominal major surgery were randomized to rEEG-guided anesthesia or routine care group. The rEEG-guided anesthesia group had propofol titrated to keep the rEEG waveform at the C-D sedation depth during surgery, while in the routine care group the anesthetist was masked to the patient's rEEG waveform and guided the anesthetic management only through clinical experience. The primary outcome was the presence of postoperative complications, the secondary outcomes included intraoperative anesthetic management and different EEG patterns.
There were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of postoperative respiratory, circulatory, neurological and gastrointestinal complications. Further EEG analysis revealed that lower frontal alpha power was significantly associated with a higher incidence of POD, and that rEEG-guidance not only reduced the duration of deeper anesthesia in patients with lower frontal alpha power, but also allowed patients with higher frontal alpha power to receive deeper and more appropriate depths of anesthesia than in the routine care group.
In elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, rEEG-guided anesthesia did not reduce the incidence of postoperative respiratory, circulatory, neurological and gastrointestinal complications. rEEG-guided anesthesia management reduced the duration of intraoperative BS in patients and the duration of over-deep sedation in patients with lower frontal alpha waves under anesthesia, and there was a strong association between lower frontal alpha power under anesthesia and the development of POD. rEEG-guided anesthesia may improve the prognosis of patients with vulnerable brains by improving the early identification of frail elderly patients and providing them with a more effective individualized anesthetic managements.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37803259/

The development of electroencephalography analysis could provide indicators for early detection, intervention, and evaluation. If there are pathophysiological changes in the brain, the BIS value will also change accordingly. In this study, we investigated the predictive value of the preoperative bispectral (BIS) index in POD for patients aged over 75 years.
In this prospective study, patients (≥ 75 years) undergoing elective non-neurosurgery and non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia were included (n = 308). Informed consent was obtained from all involved patients. Before the operation and during the first 5 postoperative days, delirium was assessed with the confusion assessment method by trained researchers twice every day. Thereafter, the preoperative bedside BIS of each patient was dynamically acquired by the BIS VISTA monitoring system and the BIS monitoring of electrodes. A series of evaluation scales were assessed before and after surgery. A preoperative predictive score was generated according to the results of multivariable logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn and the area under the curves was estimated to evaluate the perioperative diagnostic values of BIS and preoperative predictive score for POD. The specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive (NPV) value were calculated.
Delirium occurred in 50 of 308 (16.2%) patients. The median BIS of delirious patients was 86.7 (interquartile range [IQR] 80.0-94.0), lower than that of the non-delirious 91.9 (IQR 89.7-95.4, P < 0.001). According to the ROC curve of the BIS index, the optimal cut-off value was 84, with a sensitivity of 48%, specificity of 87%, PPV 43%, NPV 89% for forecasting POD and the area under curves was 0.67.

We aimed to examine the feasibility of bio-impedance spectroscopy (BIS) to record serial peri‑operative fluid volumes in the pediatric surgical population.
Children who underwent major elective general surgery from March 2019 to March 2020 were included. Total body water (TBW) assessment by BIS was recorded prior to surgery and on subsequent post-operative days (POD). We recorded the duration, tolerance and completion of each BIS assessment. We used Spearman coefficient and Bland Altman analysis to examine correlation and agreement between fluid balance (FB) in ml/kg calculated from intake/output (IO) recording and measured by BIS.
20 (87%) of 23 consented patients, median age 2.5 (1-17) years and 13 (65%) male, completed pre-operative and post-operative measurements, and were included in the analysis. Median time required for BIS assessments was 10 (5-15) minutes, and there were no recorded side effects or intolerance. The correlation coefficient for fluid balance measurements on POD 1 between BIS and IO methods was 0.59 (p = 0.01); mean bias (limits) of agreement was 26 (111 to 163) mL/kg. The trend in TBW measured by BIS declined from POD 1-3, while the recorded FB increased.
Bedside BIS is feasible and well-tolerated. Despite moderate correlation between fluid balance assessment by BIS and IO on POD 1, the wide limits of agreement between values from these methods preclude their use interchangeably. The role of BIS in assessment of fluid status in the pediatric surgical population should be further examined.

Patients with delirium require a longer hospital stay and present more postoperative complications, which also increases hospital costs. Given its importance and the lack of specific treatment, multifactorial preventive strategies are evidenced based. Our hypothesis is that using general anaesthesia and avoiding the maximum time in excessively deep anaesthetic planes through BIS neuromonitoring device will reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients over the age of 65 and their hospitalization stay. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: The visible BIS group and the hidden BIS neuromonitoring group. In the visible BIS group, the depth of anaesthesia was sustained between 40 and 60, while in the other group the depth of anaesthesia was guided by hemodynamic parameters and the Minimum Alveolar Concentration value. Patients were assessed three times a day by research staff fully trained during the 72 h after the surgery to determine the presence of POD, and there was follow-up at 30 days. Patients who developed delirium (n = 69) was significantly lower in the visible BIS group (n = 27; 39.1%) than in the hidden BIS group (n = 42, 60.9%; p = 0.043). There were no differences between the subtypes of delirium in the two groups.

This study aimed to determine whether targeting bispectral index (BIS) readings of 50 (light anaesthesia) was associated with a lower incidence of POD than targeting BIS readings of 35 (deep anaesthesia).
This multicentre randomised clinical trial of 655 at-risk patients undergoing major surgery from eight centres in three countries assessed delirium for 5 days postoperatively using the 3 min confusion assessment method (3D-CAM) or CAM-ICU, and cognitive screening using the Mini-Mental State Examination at baseline and discharge and the Abbreviated Mental Test score (AMTS) at 30 days and 1 yr. Patients were assigned to light or deep anaesthesia. The primary outcome was the presence of postoperative delirium on any of the first 5 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes included mortality at 1 yr, cognitive decline at discharge, cognitive impairment at 30 days and 1 yr, unplanned ICU admission, length of stay, and time in electroencephalographic burst suppression.
The incidence of postoperative delirium in the BIS 50 group was 19% and in the BIS 35 group was 28% (odds ratio 0.58 [95% confidence interval: 0.38-0.88]; P=0.010). At 1 yr, those in the BIS 50 group demonstrated significantly better cognitive function than those in the BIS 35 group (9% with AMTS ≤6 vs 20%; P<0.001).
Among patients undergoing major surgery, targeting light anaesthesia reduced the risk of postoperative delirium and cognitive impairment at 1 yr.

The ability to emerge patients from anesthesia quickly to detect neurological abnormalities immediately after surgery is vital in this patient population. The objective of this pilot study was to assess if any of three general anesthetic techniques for CEA are associated with a shorter time to a reliable postoperative neurological exam. Secondary objectives were to assess postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), postoperative delirium (POD), and hemodynamic stability. Twenty-one patients undergoing CEA were enrolled and randomized to different combinations of inhalational and intravenous anesthesia: Group A: propofol, remifentanil, and desflurane; Group B: dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, and desflurane; Group C: remifentanil and desflurane. Anesthetic depth was titrated using a bispectral index (BIS) monitor to a goal of 50-60. Time was recorded from surgery end to first meaningful neurological exam. Neurocognitive testing was completed preoperatively and up to 1 week postoperatively to assess POD (3D-CAM) and POCD (Short Blessed Test). Time to first reliable neurological exam was 2 minutes longer in group A (9 min ± 4 min) compared to group B and group C (7 min ± 3 min; 7 min ± 4 min), although this was not statistically significant.

33975095,The influence of age on EEG-based anaesthesia indices.,Journal of clinical anesthesia,2021,"Obert DP, Schweizer C, Zinn S, Kratzer S, Hight D, Sleigh J, Schneider G, García PS, Kreuzer M","In the upcoming years there will be a growing number of elderly patients requiring general anaesthesia. As age is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD) the incidence of POD will increase concordantly. One approach to reduce the risk of POD would be to avoid excessively high doses of anaesthetics by using neuromonitoring to guide anaesthesia titration. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of patient's age on various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based anaesthesia indices.
We conducted an analysis of previously published data by replaying single electrode EEG episodes of maintenance of general anaesthesia from 180 patients (18-90 years; ASA I-IV) into the five different commercially available monitoring systems and evaluated their indices. We included the State/Response Entropy, Narcotrend, qCON/qNOX, bispectral index (BIS), and Treaton MGA-06. For a non-commercial comparison, we extracted the spectral edge frequency (SEF) from the BIS. To evaluate the influence of the age we generated linear regression models. We also assessed the correlation between the various indices.
During anaesthetic maintenance the values of the SEF, State/Response Entropy, qCON/qNOX and BIS all significantly increased (0.05 Hz/0.19-0.26 index points per year) with the patient's age (p < 0.001); whereas the Narcotrend did not change significantly with age (0.06 index points per year; p = 0.28). The index values of the Treaton device significantly decreased with age (-0.09 index points per year; p < 0.001). These findings were independent of the administered dose of anaesthetics.
Almost all current neuromonitoring devices are influenced by age, with the potential to result in inappropriately high dosage of anaesthetics. Therefore, anaesthesiologists should be aware of this phenomenon, and the next generation of monitors should correct for these changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33975095/

Least significant change determines technical error via same-day consecutive tests but does not integrate biological variation, which is more relevant for longitudinal monitoring. The aim of this study was to assess biological variation using least significant change measures from body composition methods used on athletes, including surface anthropometry (SA), air displacement plethysmography (BOD POD), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS). Thirty-two athletic males (age = 31 ± 7 years; stature = 183 ± 7 cm; mass = 92 ± 10 kg) underwent three testing sessions over 2 days using four methods. Least significant change values were calculated from differences in Day 1 Test 1 versus Day 1 Test 2 (same-day precision), as well as Day 1 Test 1 versus Day 2 (consecutive-day precision). There was high agreement between same-day and consecutive-day fat mass and fat-free mass measurements for all methods. Consecutive-day precision error in comparison with the same-day precision error was 50% higher for fat mass estimates from BIS (3,607 vs. 2,331 g), 25% higher from BOD POD (1,943 vs. 1,448 g) and DXA (1,615 vs. 1,204 g), but negligible from SA (442 vs. 586 g). Consecutive-day precision error for fat-free mass was 50% higher from BIS (3,966 vs. 2,276 g) and SA (1,159 vs. 568 g) and 25% higher from BOD POD (1,894 vs. 1,450 g) and DXA (1,967 vs. 1,461 g) than the same-day precision error. Precision error in consecutive-day analysis considers both technical error and biological variation, enhancing the identification of small, yet significant changes in body composition of resistance-trained male athletes.

We included fourteen studies in the systematic review, eight of which were eligible for meta-analysis. BIS proved to be protective against POD at 1 day postoperatively in a cohort of 2138 patients (16.1% vs. 22.8% for BIS vs. no BIS groups, respectively; relative risk [RR] 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59 to 0.85, without significant between-study heterogeneity I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.590).

Current treatment involves the use of the antidote N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in patients deemed at risk of liver damage. This regimen was introduced in the 1970s and has remained largely unchanged even though the initial NAC infusion is frequently associated with adverse reactions, in particular nausea, vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions. NAC has reduced efficacy for preventing liver injury in those patients who present later after overdose. We designed a randomised study investigating the safety and tolerability of a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, calmangafodipir (PP100-01), co-treatment with a 12-h NAC regimen compared with NAC treatment alone in patients with POD.
We have designed an open-label, randomised, exploratory, rising dose design, NAC-controlled, phase 1 safety and tolerability study in patients treated with NAC for POD. A total of 24 patients will be assigned into one of three dosing cohorts of eight patients (n = 6 for PP100-01 and NAC; n = 2 for NAC alone). The doses of PP100-01 are 2, 5, and 10 μmol/kg. The primary outcome is the safety and tolerability of PP100-01 when co-administered with a 12-h NAC regimen compared with NAC treatment alone. Furthermore, the study will explore if PP100-01 has potential efficacy for the treatment of paracetamol-induced liver injury by measurement of conventional clinical and exploratory biomarkers.
The aim of the study is to test the safety and tolerability of a SOD mimetic, PP100-01, in combination with a 12-h NAC regimen in patients presenting within 24 h of POD. This study will provide valuable data regarding the incidence of adverse events caused by the 12-h NAC plus PP100-01 regimen and may provide evidence of PP100-01 efficacy in the treatment of paracetamol-induced liver injury.

Monitoring of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) or evoked potential (EP) indices may prevent or minimize POD and POCD, probably through optimization of anaesthetic doses.
To assess whether the use of processed EEG or auditory evoked potential (AEP) indices (bispectral index (BIS), narcotrend index, cerebral state index, state entropy and response entropy, patient state index, index of consciousness, A-line autoregressive index, and auditory evoked potentials (AEP index)) as guides to anaesthetic delivery can reduce the risk of POD and POCD in non-cardiac surgical or non-neurosurgical adult patients undergoing general anaesthesia compared with standard practice where only clinical signs are used.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trial registry databases up to 28 March 2017. We updated this search in February 2018, but these results have not been incorporated in the review.
We included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing any method of processed EEG or evoked potential techniques (entropy, BIS, AEP etc.) against a control group where clinical signs were used to guide doses of anaesthetics in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing general anaesthesia for non-cardiac or non-neurosurgical elective operations.
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: occurrence of POD; and occurrence of POCD. Secondary outcomes included: all-cause mortality; any postoperative complications; and postoperative length of stay. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.
We included six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 2929 participants comparing processed EEG or EP indices-guided anaesthesia with clinical signs-guided anaesthesia. There are five ongoing studies and one study awaiting classification.Anaesthesia administration guided by the indices from a processed EEG (bispectral index) probably reduces the risk of POD within seven days after surgery with risk ratio (RR) of 0.71 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 17, 95% CI 11 to 34; 2197 participants; 3 RCTs; moderate quality of evidence). Three trials also showed the lower rate of POCD at 12 weeks after surgery (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.96; NNTB 38, 95% CI 21 to 289; 2051 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but it is uncertain whether processed EEG indices reduce POCD at one week (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02; 3 trials; 1989 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and at 52 weeks (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.80; 1 trial; 59 participants; very low quality of evidence). There may be little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.64; 1 trial; 1155 participants; low-quality evidence). One trial suggested a lower risk of any postoperative complications with processed EEG (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; 902 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no effect on reduced postoperative length of stay (mean difference -0.2 days, 95% CI -2.02 to 1.62; 1155 participants; low-quality evidence).
There is moderate-quality evidence that optimized anaesthesia guided by processed EEG indices could reduce the risk of postoperative delirium in patients aged 60 years or over undergoing non-cardiac surgical and non-neurosurgical procedures. We found moderate-quality evidence that postoperative cognitive dysfunction at three months could be reduced in these patients. The effect on POCD at one week and over one year after surgery is uncertain. There are no data available for patients under 60 years. Further blinded randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate strategies for the amelioration of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and their consequences such as dementia (including Alzheimer's disease (AD)) in both non-elderly (below 60 years) and elderly (60 years or over) adult patients.

The acute impact of subject presentation (ad libitum food and fluid intake plus physical activity) on body composition estimation using field and laboratory methods has been quantified, but the impact on interpretation of longitudinal change is unknown. This study evaluated the impact of athlete presentation (standardised versus non-standardised) on interpretation of change in physique traits over time. Thirty athletic males (31.2 ± 7.5 years; 182.2 ± 6.5 cm; 91.7 ± 10.3 kg; 27.6 ± 2.6 kg/m
Tests were conducted after an overnight fast (BASEam) and ~ 7 h later after ad libitum food/fluid and physical activity (BASEpm). This procedure was repeated 6 months later (POSTam and POSTpm). Magnitude of changes in the mean was assessed by standardisation.
After 6 months of self-selected training and diet, standardised presentation testing (BASEam to POSTam) identified trivial changes from the smallest worthwhile effect (SWE) in fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) for all methods except for BIS (FM) where there was a large change (7.2%) from the SWE. Non-standardised follow-up testing (BASEam to POSTpm) showed trivial changes from the SWE except for small changes in FFM (BOD POD) of 1.1%, and in FM (3C and 4C models) of 6.4 and 3.5%. Large changes from the SWE were found in FFM (BIS, 3C and 4C models) of 2.2, 1.8 and 1.8% and in FM (BIS) of 6.4%. Non-standardised presentation testing (BASEpm to POSTpm) identified trivial changes from the SWE in FFM except for BIS which was small (1.1%). A moderate change from the SWE was found for BOD POD (3.3%) and large for BIS (9.4%) in FM estimations.
Changes in body composition utilising non-standardised presentation were more substantial and often in the opposite direction to those identified using standardised presentation, causing misinterpretation of change in physique traits. Standardised presentation prior to body composition assessment for athletic populations should be advocated to enhance interpretation of true change.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29633017/

In this study, weevaluated the effect of a single pre-induction dose of dexmedetomidine on anaestheticrequirements, postoperative pain and clinical recovery after ambulatory ureteroscopy andureteric stenting under general anaesthesia.
Sixty patients were randomised to receive IV dexmedetomidine 0.5 μg.kg-
Group DEX patients had significant reduction in sevoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), mean (SD) DEX vs. Placebo 0.6 (0.2) vs. 0.9 (0.1), p = 0.037; reduced postoperative resting pain at 1 h (VAS 0-10) (mean (SD) 1.00 (1.84) vs. 2.63 (2.78), p = 0.004), POD 1 (mean (SD) 1.50 (1.48) vs. 2.87 (2.72), p = 0.002), POD 2 (0.53 (0.97) vs. 1.73 (1.96), p = 0.001) and POD 3 (0.30 (0.75) vs. 0.89 (1.49), p = 0.001). DEX patients also had less pain on movement POD 1 (3.00 (2.12) vs. 4.30 (3.10), p = 0.043) and POD 2 (2.10 (1.98) vs. 3.10 (2.46), p = 0.040), with higher resumption of daily activities by 48 h compared to placebo, 87% vs. 63%, p = 0.04.
We conclude that a single dose of dexmedetomidine was a useful adjuvant in reducing MAC and postoperative pain (at 1 h and POD 1-3), facilitating faster return to daily activities by 48 h.

However, previous human studies have produced inconsistent findings, and few have assessed potential effects beyond 6 years of age.
To evaluate the effect of supplementing women in the second half of pregnancy with omega-3 LCPUFA, chiefly as DHA, on the percentage body fat of children at 7 years of age, as assessed by two methods: air displacement plethysmography (BOD POD) and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS).
A time-restricted follow up at 7 years of age of children born to mothers enrolled in DOMInO (DHA to Optimise Maternal Infant Outcome) randomized controlled trial, in which women took either high-DHA tuna oil (800mg/day DHA) or placebo capsules from 20 weeks' gestation to delivery, at Adelaide-based centers. Primary outcomes were the percentage body fat at 7 years of age as assessed by both BOD POD and BIS. Weight, height, waist/hip circumferences and BMI were also recorded.
A total of 252 DOMInO children (n=135 males, n=117 females) completed the follow up study. There were no differences between the DHA and placebo groups in percentage body fat as assessed by either BOD POD [adjusted mean difference: -0.35, 95% CI: -1.46, 2.16; P=0.71] or BIS [adjusted mean difference: 0.64, 95% CI: -0.99, 2.27; P=0.44].

percent body fat (%BF) was examined in 22 firefighters on two separate days in a climate-controlled mobile trailer using ADP. Total body water was examined in a subset of participants (n = 12) using bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) to determine %BF using Siri's 3-C model.
There were no differences in environmental measures (P≥0·138), %BF for ADP (P = 0·276), or %BF for the Siri 3-C model (P = 0·382) between day 1 and day 2.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate standardised (overnight fasted, rested and hydrated) v. non-standardised (afternoon and non-fasted) presentation on technical and biological error on surface anthropometry (SA), 2C, 3C and 4C models. In thirty-two athletic males, measures of SA, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) and air displacement plethysmography (BOD POD) were taken to establish 2C, 3C and 4C models. Tests were conducted after an overnight fast (duplicate), about 7 h later after ad libitum food and fluid intake, and repeated 24 h later before and after ingestion of a specified meal. Magnitudes of changes in the mean and typical errors of measurement were determined. Mean change scores for non-standardised presentation and post meal tests for FM were substantially large in BIS, SA, 3C and 4C models. For FFM, mean change scores for non-standardised conditions produced large changes for BIS, 3C and 4C models, small for DXA, trivial for BOD POD and SA. Models that included a total body water (TBW) value from BIS (3C and 4C) were more sensitive to TBW changes in non-standardised conditions than 2C models.

Therefore, reducing postoperative morbidity and mortality is a major concern in medical research and practice. Dependence on caregivers and cognitive impairment represent two major risk factors in the elderly, especially in frail patients after surgery under general anesthesia. In this context, continuous monitoring of the depth of anesthesia using a bispectral index (BIS) sensor may reduce the occurrence of impairments by gaining better control of the anesthetic depth. The first aim of this study is to compare manual versus automated administration of intravenous anesthetics with regard to 6-month functional decline in persons aged 70 years and older. The secondary objective includes an evaluation of the influence of the frail phenotype on self-sufficiency in elderly patients after general anesthesia.
After receiving ethical committee approval and written consent, a complete preoperative assessment of physiological reserve and self-sufficiency will be performed on patients more than 70 years old who are scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia. This evaluation will determine the patient's frailty status in three categories: robust, pre-frail, and frail. Then, patients will be randomized into two groups: manual administration of anesthetics guided by BIS sensor (manual group) or automated administration (automated group) with recording of the anesthesia. A second examination will be scheduled after 6 months to assess changes in functional abilities, cognitive functions, and frailty status. A priori calculation of sample size gives a population of 430 patients to be included in this multicenter trial.
This clinical study is designed to detect any postoperative complications and deaths related to the performance of the general anesthesia guided by the BIS sensor and the preoperative functional status of the elderly: robust, pre-frail, or frail.

We analysed whether perioperative bilateral BIS monitoring may detect abnormalities before the onset of POD in cardiac surgery patients.
In a prospective observational study, 81 patients undergoing cardiac surgery were included. Bilateral Bispectral Index (BIS)-monitoring was applied during the pre-, intra- and postoperative period, and BIS, EEG Asymmetry (ASYM), and Burst Suppression Ratio (BSR) were recorded. POD was diagnosed according to the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit, and patients were divided into a delirium and non-delirium group.
POD was detected in 26 patients (32%). A trend towards a lower ASYM was observed in the delirium group as compared to the non-delirium group on the preoperative day (ASYM = 48.2 ± 3.6% versus 50.0 ± 4.7%, mean ± sd, p = 0.087) as well as before induction of anaesthesia, with oral midazolam anxiolysis (median ASYM = 49.5%, IQR [47.4;51.5] versus 50.6%, IQR [49.1;54.2], p = 0.081). Delirious patients remained significantly (p = 0.018) longer in a burst suppression state intraoperatively (107 minutes, IQR [47;170] versus 44 minutes, IQR [11;120]) than non-delirious patients. Receiver operating analysis revealed burst suppression duration (area under the curve = 0.73, p = 0.001) and BSR (AUC = 0.68, p = 0.009) as predictors of POD.
Intraoperative assessment of BSR may identify patients at risk of POD and should be investigated in further studies. So far it remains unknown whether there is a causal relationship or rather an association between intraoperative burst suppression and the development of POD.

24413547,A prospective evaluation of the incidence of adverse events in nurse-administered moderate sedation guided by sedation scores or Bispectral Index.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2014,"Yang KS, Habib AS, Lu M, Branch MS, Muir H, Manberg P, Sigl JC, Gan TJ","Moderate sedation is routinely performed in patients undergoing minor therapeutic and diagnostic procedures outside the operating room. The level of sedation is often monitored by sedation nurses using clinical criteria, such as sedation scores. The Bispectral Index (BIS) is derived from changes in the electroencephalograph profile that may provide an objective measure of the level of sedation. In this prospective observational study, we investigated whether using BIS values to guide sedative drug administration influences the level of sedation and the incidence of adverse events compared with using Ramsay sedation scale (RSS) only in nurse-administered moderate sedation. We hypothesized that both depth of sedation and the incidence of adverse events related to oversedation would decrease when sedation nurses used BIS values to help guide sedative drug administration.
Sedation care was provided by trained sedation nurses under the supervision of a physician performing the procedure. The sedation regimen was initiated with IV midazolam 1 to 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg or hydromorphone 0.2 mg. Additional small boluses of midazolam, fentanyl, or hydromorphone were administered to maintain an RSS of 2 to 3 (cooperative, oriented, and responding to verbal command). Propofol was not used. Information including patient demographics, type of procedure, medication administered, RSS, and rates of adverse events was recorded by the sedation nurses for each patient on a computer-readable form. The study was divided into 3 phases. In phase 1 (baseline, 6 months' duration), baseline data on sedation practice were prospectively collected. There was no change from standard of care for all patients except that each patient had a BIS sensor attached, but the monitor was covered and nurses were blinded to the BIS values. In phase 2 (training, 3 months), the sedation nurses received comprehensive education on the use of BIS to guide sedative drug administration, pharmacology of commonly used drugs, and methods for rescue from oversedation. The recommended BIS range for moderate sedation was 75 to 90. Adequate training of all sedation nurses on the use of BIS was documented. In phase 3 (implementation, 6 months), the BIS values were used to guide drug administration.
Data were available on 1766 patients (999 and 767 patients in phases 1 and 3, respectively). Most of the procedures were colonoscopies, upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, examinations under anesthesia, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and central venous access catheter placements. No differences in the demographics between the 2 groups were observed. The RSS was inversely associated with the BIS value, r = -0.16 (95% confidence interval, -0.19 to -0.12; P < 0.00001). An RSS of 2 to 3 was maintained in 94% of patients in phase 1 and 96% of patients in phase 3 The mean (±SD) BIS values were 80.9 ± 6.8 in phase 1 and 80.4 ± 6.5 in phase 3. The number of sedation-related adverse events was lower in our sample when BIS was used, with an odds ratio of 0.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.62; P < 0.0001), and patients with restlessness had a lower BIS value than those without this symptom (P < 0.0001). No serious adverse events or deaths were reported.
Nurse-administered moderate sedation using midazolam and fentanyl was usually associated with appropriate levels of sedation as assessed by both the RSS and BIS with an overall low incidence of adverse events. The use of BIS did not change the mean level of sedation significantly, although the number of sedation-related adverse events appears to be lower when BIS was used.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24413547/

Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) has recently been developed and seems equally effective while associated with fewer side-effects. Both require general anaesthesia, which could be quantified using the bispectral index (BIS). We compared ECT and MST with respect to recovery times, left-sided BIS, and left-right differences in BIS.
In this prospective, observational study, we enrolled 10 successive patients receiving ECT and 10 patients undergoing MST. Anaesthesia was performed with propofol and monitored with a bilateral BIS sensor. The seizure was elicited when the BIS was within a range from 50 to 60. The time to eye opening was measured and bilateral BIS were recorded for 10 min after seizure induction.
A comparable anaesthetic depth was observed in the ECT and MST groups at baseline [mean (standard deviation, sd) BIS values of 94.1 (4.1) and 95.5 (3.0), respectively] and before seizure induction [mean (sd) BIS values of 52.3 (9.6) and 55.2 (10.3), respectively]. Post-ictally, MST patients opened their eyes significantly earlier than ECT patients [3.0 (1.0) vs 6.7 (1.3) min, P<0.001]. They showed a significantly higher BIS at 2 min after seizure induction [69.2 (10.1) vs 50.9 (15.9), P=0.003], and this difference was still present at 10 min after seizure induction [BIS 81.5 (6.5) vs 68.0 (16.4), P<0.001]. Significant differences between the left and right BIS were observed in neither the ECT nor the MST group.
At a comparable anaesthetic depth, MST is superior to ECT in terms of post-ictal recovery, which is correctly reflected by higher post-ictal BIS values. Unilateral BIS monitoring is sufficient to monitor anaesthetic depth in ECT and MST patients. TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER: NCT 01318018.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24305645/

To evaluate whether critically ill patients are adequately sedated during aeromedical transport. Methods. This was a prospective, observational study of a convenience sample of critically ill patients transported by helicopter. All intubated patients who received sedatives and/or paralytics to facilitate transport were eligible for enrollment by the attending clinician. Prior to liftoff, a BIS sensor was applied to the patient's forehead. Minimum, maximum, and mean BIS index scores were recorded every minute during transport. Results. Forty-seven patients (57% male) were enrolled, with a median age of 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 18-81, range 14 to 86 years). The median duration of monitoring was 15.0- minutes (IQR 6.0-26.0, range 2 to 33). The median BIS score was 54.6 (IQR 38.6-67.3, range 28 to 89.5). Only two patients (4.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5% to 14.8%) had at least one BIS score greater than 85, the accepted threshold for recall. Conclusion.

We investigated the influence of two degrees of NMB on BIS, Alaris auditory-evoked potential index (AAI), and the electromyogram (EMG) obtained with needle electrodes from the frontal and temporal muscles, immediately adjacent to the BIS-sensor.
Twenty patients were anesthetized with sevoflurane, titrated for 30 min to an end-tidal concentration of 1.2% (baseline). Rocuronium was infused to 50% (partial) and 95% (profound) depression of the first twitch in a train-of-four response, the order being randomly chosen. Noxious tetanic electrical stimulation was applied at four occasions: 1) at baseline (control measurement), 2 and 3) at each degree of NMB, and 4) after neostigmine reversal. BIS, AAI, and EMG were obtained 2 min before and 2 min after each noxious stimulation.
Median BIS and AAI at baseline were 44 (39-50) and 15 (14-16), respectively. The two degrees of NMB did not affect BIS, AAI, and EMG before noxious stimulation. In contrast, profound NMB altered the BIS and AAI responses to noxious stimulation when compared with partial NMB, (BIS P = 0.01, AAI P < 0.01), after neostigmine reversal (BIS P < 0.01, AAI P = 0.01) and compared with baseline (BIS P = 0.08, AAI P = 0.02).

However, there are no data available on the accuracy of the Entropy Module in estimating nociception during sevoflurane anaesthesia.
Forty female patients were enrolled in the present study. Each patient was allocated randomly to one of four end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (ET(sev)) groups (1.3, 1.7, 2.1 or 2.5%). A BIS Sensor (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) and an Entropy Sensor (Datex-Ohmeda) were applied side-by-side to the forehead. The bispectral index (A-2000 BIS Monitor, version 3.4, Aspect Medical Systems), response entropy, state entropy and patient movement were observed after electrical stimulation (20, 40, 60 and 80 mA, 100 Hz, 5 s) and after skin incision during sevoflurane anaesthesia (1.3, 1.7, 2.1 or 2.5%). Accuracy of the EEG variables in differentiating the intensity of electrical stimulation was estimated by the prediction probability (P(K)) values.
Response entropy and state entropy [median, (range)] before skin incision were significantly lower in patients who did not move [29 (15-41) and 24 (14-41)] than in those that did [38 (24-53) and 37 (24-52)], but there was no significant difference in BIS. All EEG variables increased significantly (P<0.0001 for all) with increases in the intensity of electrical stimulation. The difference between response entropy and state entropy increased with increases in the electrical stimulation (P<0.0001). However, no EEG variables could differentiate the intensity of the electrical stimulations accurately because of low P(K)-values (P(K)<0.8).
Noxious stimulation increased the difference between response entropy and state entropy. However, an increase in the difference does not always indicate inadequate analgesia and should be interpreted carefully during anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16531443/

We developed a simple and sensitive colorimetric assay for polyamines in erythrocytes using oat seedling polyamine oxidase (OSPO). The method is based on the unique substrate specificity of OSPO, which is active toward Spd and Spm, but not toward diamines such as Put and cadaverine and monoamines such as histamine.
The polyamines, which were purified from packed erythrocytes by weak cation-exchange chromatography, were incubated with OSPO at 37 degrees C for 15 min. In the presence of the H(2)O(2) produced by this polyamine oxidase reaction and a new chromogen, N-(carboxymethylaminocarbonyl)-4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)-diphenylamine sodium salt (DA-64), peroxidase (POD) catalyzes the formation of N-[4-[[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]imino]-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene]-N-methylmethanaminium chloride (Bindschedler's Green) having an absorption maximum at 727 nm.
The detection limit was 0.2 microM/l for packed erythrocytes. The within-run and between-run precisions (coefficient of variation, CVs) were 5.6-15.2% and 6.5-16.4%, respectively. Analytical recoveries were 93.3-97.4%. Polyamine values obtained by this assay correlated well with those obtained by an HPLC (y=0.948x + 1.912; r=0.944; n=46).

Our aims were: to evaluate variations of BIS in the presence of high EMG activity associated with muscular rigidity after administration of high-dose fentanyl; to compare muscular rigidity, as measured by the EMG variable of the BIS monitor, in patients who were administered two different dosages of fentanyl at induction of cardiac anaesthesia.
26 patients undergoing CABG surgery, after premedication with morphine 0.15 mg/kg, were randomized to receive either fentanyl 50 mcg/kg (group F) or fentanyl 10 mcg/kg plus etomidate 0.2 mg/kg (group EF). The induction dose was administered over 2 minutes. Patients were manually ventilated with O2 via face mask. Five minutes after induction was complete, patients were clinically assessed using the Responsiveness portion of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale (OAAS). Haemodynamic data were recorded and arterial blood samples obtained at the time of OAAS observation. Patients were administered a neuromuscular blocking agent only after the OAAS assessment. BIS (3.4) was recorded from an A-2000 EEG monitor (Aspect Medical Systems) using disposable sensors (BIS Sensor, Aspect Medical Systems) applied per manufacturer's instructions. Data were recorded on a PC for off-line analysis.
At the time of OAAS observation, mean (95% CI) BIS in group F was 85 (77-92) compared to 67 (56-79) in group EF (p = 0.01). Similarly, mean (95% CI) EMG was 50 dB (45-56) in F and 41 dB (35-47) in EF (p = 0.01). Correlation between BIS and EMG was very high (r2 = 0.88). OAAS scores were significantly higher in group F (p = 0.03). Non significant correlation was observed between BIS and OAAS scores (r2 = 0.32, p = 0.1). Backward stepwise multiple regression analysis including EMG, pH, CO2, O2 and OASS scores showed EMG as strong predictor of BIS (p < 0.0001, r2 = 0.7). Regression of EMG against BIS yielded the equation: BIS = 3.7 + (1.6 x EMG).
During fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity BIS recordings reflect EMG variations. When assessing BIS in the absence of neuromuscular blockade, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of EMG on BIS before making conclusions about depth of sedation. Fentanyl-induced rigidity appears to be a dose-related phenomenon which the EMG variable of BIS 3.4 is able to quantify.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12885182/
12370681,Effects of remifentanil infusion bis-titrated on early recovery for obese outpatients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,Minerva anestesiologica,2002,"Paventi S, Santevecchi A, Perilli V, Sollazzi L, Grio M, Ranieri R","In obese patients functional residual capacity comes down with a possible hypoxemia in postoperative period. In fact many studies has been begun to determine optimum ventilation regulation and the best position for these patients, but the question has not been solved. As remifentanil can reduce of 50% the inhalatory anaesthetic request and reverse Trendelemburg position is extremely useful for these patients, we hypothesized that use of a continuous remifentanil infusion during balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane, BIS-titrated, associated to reverse Trendelem-burg position could facilitate emergence from anaesthesia in obese patients undergoing laparascopic cholecystectomy.
We studied 40 patients, ASA II class, with higher than 30 kg/m2 body mass index, undergoing to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All the patients, in operating room, received standard monitoring and BIS sensor application. All the data were continuously collected. Induction of anaesthesia has been with a refracted bolus in 120 sec of remifentanil 1 mg/kg, followed by propofol 1.5 mg/kg and cisatracurium 0.15 mg/kg. Maintenance of anaesthesia has been by balanced anaesthesia with continuous remifentanil infusion, ventilating patients with sevoflurane in oxygen and air. Patients were randomized into two homogenous groups. Into the control group has been varied sevoflurane inspiratory concentration on the ground of BIS value (from 0.3% to 3%), while into remifentanil group remifentanil infusion has been varied (from 0.25 to 2 mg/kg/min) to maintain medium pressure values which don't stray more than 25% from basal values, on the ground of BIS values. On pre-established times of operation, respiratory mechanics and blood gases were examined.
As it was to expect, sevoflurane concentration variations resulted very high in control group compared to remifentanil group. Awakening time, extubation, orientation and transfer to PACU (postanaesthesia care unit) resulted significantly lower than remifentanil group.
Concluding, remifentanil infusion, BIS-titrated, facilitates awakening times from balanced anaesthesia with Sevoflurane in obese patients, submitted to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12370681/
11812701,Electrocardiographic electrodes provide the same results as expensive special sensors in the routine monitoring of anesthetic depth.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2002,"Hemmerling TM, Harvey P","The Bispectral Index (BIS) is a mathematically derived electroencephalographic (EEG) derivative that has been introduced to monitor depth of anesthesia (1,2). The A-2000 BIS monitoring system (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Newton, MA) is currently the only commercially available system to monitor depth of anesthesia. In several studies, its propensity to optimize the use of hypnotics to maintain and achieve a certain depth of anesthesia has been described (3,4). Some studies have even proposed that the routine use of the monitoring system can decrease awareness (1,5), an increasing factor in malpractice claims. The cost-benefit calculations for BIS monitoring suffer from the fact that like its predecessor, the 1000-A BIS monitor, the A-2000 BIS monitoring system demands the use of expensive, special electrodes (6). Although the application of the single-use BIS sensor is very comfortable and easy to use, its high price of approximately $10-20 US prevents many anesthesiologists from using it. Furthermore, whereas the former model of the monitor (1000-A BIS monitor; Aspect Medical Systems, Inc.) used standardized connectors, which allowed the use of other electrodes such as electrocardiogram (ECG), the new monitoring system makes this very difficult because of special connectors that match the equivalent connector at the proximal BIS sensor site. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare BIS values derived from the original BIS sensor with BIS values derived from commercially available ECG electrodes. This comparison was made possible by designing and manufacturing a connector allowing the use of ECG electrodes.
The Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor adequately monitors depth of anesthesia. The routine use of this monitor has been hampered by the benefit-cost equation because only special expensive electrodes can be used. We examined the agreement of BIS values obtained by original sensor electrodes and commercial electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes. These ECG electrodes can replace more expensive BIS sensors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11812701/
11381378,Assessment of recovery in patients undergoing intravenous conscious sedation using bispectral analysis.,Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,2001,"Sandler NA, Hodges J, Sabino M","The Bispectral Index (BIS) has been recently shown to objectively predict the level of sedation in patients undergoing conscious sedation. It was the goal of this study to directly compare the recovery profile of patients where the BIS was used to monitor sedation with a control group where the monitor was not used.
Forty patients undergoing third molar extractions under intravenous conscious sedation were randomly assigned to 2 groups. In both groups, induction of sedation was performed using a standard dose of fentanyl (1.5 microg/kg) and midazolam (0.05 mg/kg). Propofol was then given in 10 to 20 mg boluses until a clinically desirable sedation level was achieved. In 1 group, the BIS was then monitored continually during surgery using a microcomputer (Aspect-1050 Monitor, Aspect Co, Natick, MA) and recorded at 5-minute intervals. The anesthetist (N.A.S.) provided additional propofol boluses to maintain a BIS level of 70 to 80. In the other group, the BIS sensor was applied, but the monitor was not used. In this group, the sedation was modified, and additional propofol was given based solely on the anesthetist's subjective assessment of the desired level of sedation (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation [OAA/S] scale level 2 to 3). Additional boluses of 1 mg of midazolam were given during the procedure if patients required repeated boluses of propofol at less than 5-minute intervals to maintain the desired sedation level (BIS level of 70 to 80 or OAA/S level of 2 to 3). These additional midazolam boluses, as well as the time of the last sedative dose (propofol or midazolam) were recorded to study the effect of these factors on recovery.
Of the 40 patients initially included in the study, 1 subject in the BIS-monitored group was excluded due to the loss of intravenous access at initiation of the case. For the remaining 39 subjects, 19 were assessed objectively using the BIS monitor, whereas 20 were assessed subjectively using the OAA/S scale. The BIS cases were slightly longer in duration than the OAA/S cases, lasting an average of 26 minutes versus 22 minutes. This difference was statistically nonsignificant (P =.19). Less propofol was used in the BIS cases, with an average of 98 mg for BIS cases versus 106 mg for OAA/S cases (P =.59). The total dose in mg/kg/min was significantly less in the BIS group (0.054 mg/kg/min) than in the OAA/S group (0.074 mg/kg/min; P =.0082). There was no significant difference in the amount of midazolam administered after induction between the 2 groups (P =.60). The surgeon, who was blinded to whether the monitor was used, ranked the third molar extractions more difficult in the BIS group (P =.05). However, patients in the BIS group were on average more cooperative, with better maintenance of muscle tone. The difference in these parameters were nonsignificant (P =.15 and .092, respectively). A positive Romberg test was obtained earlier in BIS patients, although this difference was nonsignificant (P =.097). The straight-line test was completed significantly sooner in BIS patients (P =.013). There was no significant difference between the BIS and OAA/S groups in perceptual speed (P =.55) or computation (P =.32). There was essentially no difference between groups in patient-assessed comfort or recall of the procedure. There were also no notable differences in anesthesia complications, return to activities of daily life, or pain medication use between the 2 groups.
The BIS provides additional information for standard monitoring techniques that helps guide the administration of sedative-hypnotic agents. It appears that use of the BIS monitor can help to titrate the level of sedation so that less drugs are used to maintain the desired level. The trend toward an earlier return of motor function in BIS-monitored patients warrants further investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11381378/
10965721,Bispectral analysis technology and equipment.,Minerva anestesiologica,2000,Sennholz G,"The Bispectral Index or ""BIS"" is a single number, composed from different EEG features, using multivariate statistical methods. It was designed for monitoring the depth of hypnosis during anaesthesia and sedation. Empirically derived from the EEGs of more than 5,000 anaesthetised patients, the BIS reflects the effect of anaesthetics on the brain. Unlike univariate measures, such as Spectral Edge Frequency or Median Frequency, the Bispectral Index is drug independent and changes with increasing doses of hypnotics in an almost linear way. Though sophisticated technology, the A-2000 BIS monitor and the BIS sensor are easy to use and also allow non-experts to monitor the depth of hypnosis and sedation on a routine basis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10965721/
