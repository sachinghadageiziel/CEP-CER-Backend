38433719,Effects of different surface treatments on surface topography and bond strength in the repair of fiber-reinforced dentin composite.,Journal of esthetic and restorative dentistry : official publication of the American Academy of Esthetic Dentistry ... [et al.],2024,"Bayraktar N, Harorli OT","This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different surface treatments on the repair bond strength between a fiber-reinforced dentin composite and a posterior composite.
Forty fiber-reinforced dentin composite resin blocks (4 mm × 4 mm × 4 mm) were separated into eight groups (n = 5) according to the surface preparation methods: (G1) negative control group, (G2) adhesive application, (G3) 50% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) application, (G4) 50% DMSO + adhesive application, (G5) 37% phosphoric acid etch + adhesive application, (G6) air abrasion + adhesive application, (G7) 37% phosphoric acid etch + 50% DMSO application + adhesive application, and (G8) air abrasion +50% DMSO application + adhesive application group. The composite surfaces were repaired in two layers with a posterior composite. Composite sticks were subjected to a micro tensile bond strength (μTBS) test. Fractured surfaces were evaluated using a stereomicroscope (×25). Short fiber-reinforced composite samples' surfaces were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Shapiro Wilk, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey HSD tests were used for statistical evaluation.
The highest average (μTBS) values were observed in G8, whereas the lowest mean μTBS values were evident in the G1 group. Statistically significant μTBS values were found in all adhesive-applied groups when compared with the negative control group. Notably, the application of 50% DMSO without adhesive did not lead to a statistically significant increase in μTBS values. SEM images demonstrated that acid etching partially eliminated residues on the composite surface, while air abrasion had a detrimental effect on the integrity of fiber structures.
In the repair of fiber-reinforced dentin composite with a posterior composite, adhesive application is an effective approach. The treatment of 50% DMSO without adhesive did not confer a statistically significant advantage, and the supplemental use of acid etch or air abrasion did not show an additional benefit compared to adhesive-only repairs.
Adhesive application emerges as a potent and effective strategy for the repair of bur-roughened fiber-reinforced dentin composites. With its limitations, the study highlights the efficacy of adhesive-only repairs without the necessity for additional surface treatments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38433719/
34002718,A Simple Technique to Repair Feldspathic Porcelain Chipping in Screw-retained Implant-supported Prosthesis: A Clinical Technique.,The journal of contemporary dental practice,2021,"Proaño L, Silva RK, Cruz AC, Özcan M, Volpato CÂ","This clinical technique report aimed to describe a composite resin repair technique performed in an implant-supported prosthesis.
Veneering ceramic fracture or chipping is one of the most frequent clinical failures in dentistry. Therefore, the use of less time- and cost-consuming ceramic repair techniques is helpful in clinical practice.
Briefly, to treat the ceramic surface, the glaze was removed at the margins of the fracture area, then, air-abrasion and acid-etching were performed. To promote chemical adhesion, a silane coupling agent and adhesive system were applied over the ceramic surface, and the composite resin was applied by incremental technique. Finally, the polish was performed.
In conclusion, the applied composite resin repair of feldspathic porcelain chipping in implant-supported prosthesis was a simple, easy, affordable, and minimally invasive treatment.
The causes of veneer materials failures in metal-ceramic crowns are considered a challenge for the dentist and a problem that displeases patients. Repairs are indicated to prevent cracks from spreading and to prevent the accumulation of biofilm on the damaged surface. Therefore, different repair protocols have been proposed to enhance the esthetic, functionality, and longevity of the implant-supported prosthesis. Additionally, the success of the clinical cases depends on the capability to identify ceramic failures and the ability to indicate/perform the correct repair protocol. Since the described repair technique of the fractured screw-retained implant-supported prosthesis was a simple, easy, affordable, and minimally invasive treatment, with excellent esthetic and masticatory results, it represents an interesting clinical option.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34002718/
33605921,The effect of different surface preparation methods and various aging periods on microtensile bond strength for composite resin repair.,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2021,"Dursun MN, Ergin E, Ozgunaltay G","To evaluate the effect of various aging periods and different surface preparation methods on microtensile bond strength (μTBS) for composite repair.
One hundred twelve composite resin blocks were formed using a nanohybrid composite resin. The samples were distributed into four groups according to surface preparation methods (n = 28): control (sound composite blocks); Er, Cr: YSGG laser; air abrasion; silicone carbide. All samples were then divided into four subgroups according to various aging periods: (i) No aging, (ii) 10,000 thermocycling, (iii) 30,000 thermocycling, and (iv) 50,000 thermocycling. Following surface preparation and aging procedures, surface topography of one sample from each group was evaluated under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The repair composites were bonded to the sample surfaces, using a three-step etch&rinse adhesive. Finally, thirty beams of size 1 × 1 × 8 mm from each group were subjected to μTBS test and failure modes were determined. The data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA, Post-hoc Bonferroni, and Chi-square tests (P = 0.05).
When different surface preparation methods were evaluated together, no aging and 10,000 thermocycling groups displayed higher μTBS values (P < 0.05). When all aging periods were evaluated together, the surface preparation with air abrasion provided higher μTBS (P < 0.05). The interactions of various aging periods with different surface preparation methods revealed significant variations in repair μTBS (P < 0.05). There were statistically significant differences on failure mode distributions among surface preparation methods (P < 0.001). SEM evaluations provided valuable outcomes that help to comment on the μTBS findings.
Different surface preparation methods, various aging periods, and the interaction of both affected the repair μTBS of the tested nanohybrid composite resin.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33605921/
32941094,Influence of Surface Conditioning on the Repair Strength of Bioactive Restorative Material.,Journal of applied biomaterials & functional materials,2020,"Awad MM, Almutairi N, Alhalabi F, Robaian A, Vohra FA, Ozcan M, Maawadh A, Alrahlah A","To evaluate the effects of surface treatment and repair material on the repair shear bond strength (SBS) of the bioactive restorative material.
A total of 240 Activa BioActive Restorative (Activa) discs were prepared, aged, and polished, and divided randomly into eight groups (
Surface treatment with air abrasion significantly improved the SBS for repair using both Activa and Bulk-RBC. Repair SBS using Activa was significantly higher compared with Bulk-RBC. Cohesive failure in substrate and mixed failures were most common in the surface-treated groups (2-4, 6-8). Air abrasion produced prominent surface topography changes compared with polishing.
Air abrasion enhances the repair SBS of aged bioactive restorative material. The use of the same material (Activa) for repair affords a higher bond strength compared with the use bulk-RBC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32941094/
32436905,Comparative evaluation of occlusal pits and fissures morphology modification techniques before application of sealants: An,Indian journal of dental research : official publication of Indian Society for Dental Research,2020,"Singh A, , Patil V, Juyal M, Raj R, Rangari P","Pits and Fissures are recognized as being highly susceptible to caries. Pit and fissure sealants are one of the best methods of preventing caries as it occludes the fissures and pits from the accumulation of plaque and cariogenic microflora. There are different methods of cleaning and preparing occlusal pits and fissures for preventing caries which helps in alleviating oral health status of paediatric population.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the microleakage of pit and fissure sealants after using five different preparation techniques, namely: A) Conventional technique using pumice prophylaxis, B) enameloplasty with round carbide bur, C) enameloplasty with fissurotomy bur, D) air polisher, and E) air abrasion.
The study was conducted on 50 caries-free premolars extracted for orthodontic purpose. These teeth were randomly assigned to five groups, 10 teeth in each for receiving fissure sealant after different surface preparation; thermocycling and sectioning of samples were performed and microleakage was assessed under a stereomicroscope after methylene blue dye immersion.
The results of air abrasion groups were significantly superior with ""0"" microleakage when compared to all other groups followed by round bur, fissurotomy bur, air polisher and pumice prophylaxis.
To improve the marginal adaptation of the sealants, minimally invasive methods are the most favoured methods of occlusal preparation. This study promises to show positive results for fissure sealants which are likely to play an important role in caries prevention and techniques that are intended to protect caries susceptible surfaces.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32436905/
