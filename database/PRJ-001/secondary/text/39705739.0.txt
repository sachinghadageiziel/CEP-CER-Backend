Summary
Introduction Intra-operative supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation expose the lungs to potentially
injurious energy. This can be quantiﬁed as `chemical power´ and `mechanical power´, respectively. In this study,
we sought to determine if intra-operative chemical and mechanical power, individually and/or in combination,
are associated with postoperative pulmonary complications.
Methods Using an individual patient data analysis of three randomised clinical trials of intra-operative
ventilation, we summarised intra-operative chemical and mechanical power using time-weighted averages. We
evaluated the association between intra-operative chemical and mechanical power and a collapsed composite
of postoperative pulmonary complications using multivariable logistic regression to estimate the odds ratios
related to the effect of 1 J.min-1 increase in chemical or mechanical power with adjustment for demographic
and intra-operative characteristics. We also included an interaction term to assess for potential synergistic
effects of chemical and mechanical power on postoperative pulmonary complications.
Results Of 3837 patients recruited to three individual trials, 2492 with full datasets were included in the
analysis. Intra-operative time-weighted average (SD) chemical power was 10.2 (3.9) J.min-1 and mechanical
power was 10.5 (4.4) J.min-1. An increase of 1 J.min-1 in chemical power was associated with 8% higher odds of
postoperative pulmonary complications (OR 1.08, 95%CI 1.05–1.10, p < 0.001), while the same increase in
mechanical power raised odds by 5% (OR 1.05, 95%CI 1.02–1.08, p = 0.003). We did not ﬁnd evidence of a
signiﬁcant interaction between chemical and mechanical power (p = 0.40), suggestive of an additive rather
than synergistic effect on postoperative pulmonary complications.
Discussion Both chemical and mechanical power are independently associated with postoperative pulmonary
complications. Further work is required to determine causality.

Introduction
Intra-operative
ventilation
transfers
energy
from
the
ventilator to lung tissue, which can be quantiﬁed as
`mechanical
power´
[1,
2].
Elevated
intra-operative
mechanical power levels may harm the lungs and are
associated
with
worse
patient
outcomes
[3,
4].
Interventions that seek to reduce mechanical power are
under
consideration
for
patients
who
require
intra-operative ventilation [5]. However, less is known
about
the
use
of
supplemental
oxygen
during
intra-operative ventilation, quantiﬁed as `chemical power´
[6]. The chemical power concept was introduced recently
as a quantitative measure of the biochemical stress
induced by hyperoxia and translates oxygen exposure
(fraction of inspired oxygen, FIO2) into a power metric with
units
of
joules
per
minute
(J.min-1).
This
involves
estimation of pulmonary oxygen consumption; calculation
of oxygen fraction converted into reactive oxygen species;
and multiplication of the rate of reactive oxygen species
production by the energy released per mole of superoxide
formation [6].
Exposure to high chemical power is linked with
postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs); multiorgan
injury; and mortality [7, 8]. The simplest way to reduce
chemical power is to reduce FIO2 to the lowest safe level,
including the use of recruitment manoeuvres and/or
titration of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Despite
potential dangers of high intrapulmonary oxygen levels,
high fractions of oxygen continue to be utilised during
intra-operative ventilation [9]. Clinical guidelines continue
to recommend higher intra-operative oxygen fractions [10,
11], justiﬁed by perceived safety margins for airway
complications and limited evidence for a reduction in
postoperative wound infections [12, 13]. Preclinical studies
suggest
that
the
combined
effect
of
chemical
and
mechanical power may amplify the risk of pulmonary injury
synergistically [14, 15], but the clinical relevance of this
observation is uncertain.
Our aim was to evaluate how intra-operative chemical
and mechanical power, individually and in combination,
inﬂuence the incidence of PPCs. We conducted a secondary
analysis on the Re–Evaluation of the effects of high PEEP
During General AnesThesia for surgery (REPEAT) database
[16, 17]. This resource integrates individual patient data
from three randomised clinical trials that evaluated the
impact of intra-operative ventilation with high PEEP on
the incidence of PPCs. We hypothesised that both chemical
and mechanical power are individually associated with
PPCs, with a synergistic interaction.
Methods
This is a secondary analysis of individual patient data from
three randomised controlled trials that investigated the
effect of low vs. high PEEP on PPCs: PROVHILO [18]; iPROVE
[19]; and PROBESE [20]. The original trials were approved
by a central institutional review board and all patients
provided informed consent. Additional institutional review
board approval or individual patient consent was required
to access this pooled database. Our report adheres to the
STROBE guideline.
For this secondary analysis, we did not include patients
with missing data on the variables of interest (complete case
analysis); duration of surgery < 2 h; and intra-operative
mechanical power > 30 J.min-1. We extracted patient and
surgery baseline characteristics: age; sex; height; weight;
BMI; ASA physical status; ARISCAT score [21]; pre-operative
SpO2; respiratory infection; pre-operative anaemia; history
of heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD); active cancer; pre-operative haemoglobin levels;
surgical approach (open vs. laparoscopic); emergency
procedure; duration of surgery; and surgical specialty. The
following
intra-operative
ventilatory
variables
were
available and extracted in hourly intervals: tidal volume;
respiratory rate; maximum airway pressure; PEEP; dynamic
driving pressure; and FIO2. Patients were followed up for
7 days after surgery to detect PPCs in the original trials, as
deﬁned in online Supporting Information Table S1.
The two co-primary exposures were deﬁned as the
time-weighted average of intra-operative chemical and
mechanical power. Chemical power was calculated using
the following equations [6]: PulmROS = 1.7 9 10-5 + ((FIO2 -
0.21) 9 1.63 9 10-4)
(mol.min-1);
chemical
power =
141,000 9 PulmROS (J.min-1), where PulmROS is the local
superoxide
production
in
mol.min-1.
Dynamic
driving
pressure (DP) was used for mechanical power calculations,
since plateau pressure was not available for all patients.
Dynamic driving pressure was calculated with maximum
airway
pressure
(Pmax)
using
the
following
equation:
DP = Pmax - PEEP (cmH2O), where Pmax and PEEP are
expressed in cmH2O. Mechanical power was calculated using
the following equation: mechanical power = 0.098 9 tidal
volume 9 respiratory rate 9 (Pmax - 0.5 9 DP) (J.min-1),
where tidal volume in litres, respiratory rate in breaths.min-1,
Pmax is maximum airway pressure in cmH2O and DP is
dynamic driving pressure in cmH2O as described above.
The primary study endpoint was a composite of
PPCs

the

formal power calculation was performed; instead, we
used all available patients with complete data from the
pooled
dataset.
For
descriptive
purposes
only,
the
population
was
divided
at
the
median
of
chemical
power to create a `high chemical power group´ and a
`low
chemical
power
group´
and
the
absolute
standardised difference was calculated to assess baseline
balance.
Inferential
statistics
were
performed
with
continuous values of chemical and mechanical power.
Chemical and mechanical power were calculated
hourly.
We
summarised
intra-operative
chemical
and
mechanical power by calculating time-weighted averages
as the area under the chemical and mechanical power time
curves divided by the number of hours of exposure
for quantifying cumulative exposure for each patient.
The
association
between
intra-operatively
applied
time-weighted average chemical and mechanical power on
a
collapsed
composite
of
PPCs
was
evaluated
by
multivariable logistic regression, estimating the odds ratios
related to the effect of 1 J.min-1 increase in chemical or
mechanical power. Potential confounders were deﬁned a
priori and included as covariates in the multivariable model.
To assess a potential interaction between chemical and
mechanical power, we repeated the model with an
interaction term for chemical and mechanical power.
We performed sensitivity analyses to explore our
results. This included analyses restricted to patients with
available plateau pressure; patients in whom FIO2 was likely
set by default to 0.4, 0.5 or 0.8, i.e. without titration to the
individual patient’s oxygenation requirements; removal of
exclusion criteria to include all patients in the database; and
with adjustment for potential effects between individual
trials. All analyses were performed based on an overall
signiﬁcance level of 0.05, using R (version 4.4.1, R Studio,
Vienna, Austria).
Results
Of 3837 patients in the pooled database, 2492 were
included in this analysis (Fig. 1). The main reasons for
exclusion were duration of surgery < 2 h; missing BMI; and
missing information on surgical approach. The mean (SD)
patient age was 57 (15) y, 1300 (52%) were female and 1258
(50%) underwent colorectal or bariatric surgery (Table 1).
The
time-weighted
averages
of
chemical
and
mechanical power were mean (SD) 10.2 (3.9) J.min-1
and 10.5 (4.4) J.min-1, respectively (Table 2). Patients who
were administered higher chemical power were older; more
often male; had a lower median BMI; and a lower median
ARISCAT score (Table 1). The time-weighted average
mechanical power was similar in patients with low and high

chemical power. Patients administered high chemical power
tended to receive higher tidal volumes but lower respiratory
rates (Table 2). Patients who experienced PPCs were more
likely to have received higher intra-operative chemical
power (online Supporting Information Figure S1).
We observed that a 1 J.min-1 increment in chemical
power was associated with an 8% increased risk of PPCs (OR
1.08, 95%CI 1.05–1.10, p < 0.001). A 1 J.min-1 increment in
mechanical power was associated with a 5% increased risk
of PPCs (OR 1.05, 95%CI 1.02–1.08, p < 0.003) (Table 3).
The probability of PPCs increased linearly over the range of
chemical power (Fig. 2a), whereas the probability of PPCs
started to increase after 15 J.min-1 of delivered mechanical
power (Fig. 2b). Our model-derived risk of PPCs suggests
that chemical and mechanical power did not interact
(p = 0.40, Fig. 3).
These ﬁndings were not altered in sensitivity analyses
when we limited patients to those who had plateau
pressures

when we extended our study population to include all

are causal or predictive for postoperative lung injury. Given
the high biological plausibility of the contribution of
chemical and mechanical power to ventilator-induced lung
injury, we recommend titration of both parameters to aim
for safe, rather than supranormal, respiratory physiological
end points.
The evidence of pulmonary harm from high chemical
power, or high FIO2, used for mechanical ventilation during
surgery, is uncertain [7, 8]. Although older randomised trials
found no effect of inspired oxygen on the incidence of PPCs
[22,
23],
more recent
studies,
with
incorporation
of
lung-protective ventilation, showed an increased risk of
postoperative
atelectasis
and
severe
PPCs
with
80%
compared with 30% inspired oxygen [24, 25]. Regarding
mechanical power, to date there are no randomised clinical
trials that target mechanical power explicitly. Nevertheless,

regression model (Table 3) and presented on a colour scale from light yellow to dark red as a 3 9 3 ﬁeld heat map.

high mechanical power-induced lung injury has been
reported in animal studies [26, 27] and was repeatedly
associated with postoperative lung injury [28, 29]. Our
ﬁndings underline the need for large robust randomised
clinical trials on intra-operative chemical and mechanical
power minimisation strategies.
Reduction of chemical power may seem straightforward
in most patients by avoiding unnecessarily high FIO2 levels.
However, patients prone to intra-operative atelectasis, such as
patients with obesity and patients undergoing laparoscopic
procedures, may require recruitment manoeuvres and higher
PEEP values to facilitate ventilation with low FIO2. In contrast,
multiple interventions may reduce mechanical power, and it
remains unclear which intervention works best [30, 31].
Recent studies underlined three essential concepts: lowering
tidal volumes necessitates higher respiratory rates, potentially
outweighing a tidal volume-related reduction in mechanical
power [32]; lowering respiratory rate effectively reduces
mechanical
power
[33];
and
permissive
hypercapnia
tolerated to facilitate lung-protective ventilation protects the
lungs [34, 35]. Therefore, permissive hypercapnic ventilation
through low respiratory rates represents a potential strategy
to reduce intra-operative mechanical power, and warrants
evaluation in future randomised trials.
Our study has several strengths and limitations. We
developed our protocol a priori before conducting our
analysis and this strengthens the scientiﬁc rigour of
our report. A key strength is the use of robust prospectively
collected clinical trial data to reduce the risk of undetected
errors common in routine clinical documentation. The large
sample
size
allowed
us
multiple
adjustments
for
well-established
factors of pulmonary risk. Regarding
limitations, the observational design of our study precludes
deﬁnitive
conclusions
about
causality.
Although
we
adjusted for numerous potential confounders, the use of
supplemental oxygen is likely confounded by underlying
pulmonary conditions and individual responses to surgery
and ventilation. Several hundred patients were not included
due to missing covariate data. However, as missingness is
likely random, we considered the risk of selection bias from
a complete case analysis to be less signiﬁcant than potential
bias introduced by imputation. We have included a
sensitivity analysis with inclusion of all patients in the
database to explore this potential effect. The original
studies
used
slightly
different
deﬁnitions
of
PPCs,
introducing potential variability and bias to our results.
Finally, our calculation of chemical power utilises FIO2
primarily; however, the underlying model also includes
pulmonary
oxygen
consumption,
which
could
be
individualised at patient or group level in future studies.
In conclusion, both chemical and mechanical power are
independently
associated
with
PPCs.
However,
while
chemical and mechanical power have an additive effect on
the risk of PPCs, we did not observe a synergistic effect. Our
ﬁndings contribute to the growing body of evidence
emphasising the need for mechanical ventilation to be as
`permissive´
as
possible,
minimising
exposure
to
mechanical and chemical power.
