Managing pre-emptive analgesia before procedures remains a crucial aspect of care. We compared pupillometry to standard clinical practice for assessing preemptive-analgesia administration and pain before ETA according to Behavioural Pain Scale (BPS), the Behavioural Pain Indicator Scale (ESCID), and the Pupillary Dilation Reflex (PDR).
A multicentre parallel-group, controlled trial with balanced (1:1) randomization.
Sedated, mechanically ventilated patients aged ≥ 18 with baseline BPS = 3, ESCID = 1, and RASS scores between -1 and -4 were included.
preemptive-analgesia was administered according to nurse criteria. In the experimental group, preemptive analgesia was administered in patients with PDR ≥ 11.5 % after a 20 mA stimulus measured using AlgiScan®. The preemptive analgesia was fentanyl one µg/kg iv bolus. We used the Chi-square statistic to compare post-intervention pain according to BPS, ESCID, and PDR pain values. A multivariate logistic regression study adjusting for sex, BIS, RASS, APACHE II, remifentanil, and preemptive analgesia was conducted.
Ninety-two patients were studied, 51 in control groups and 41 in intervention groups. Pain incidence was lower in the experimental group. Significantly, 43.9 % of patients in the experimental group were prescribed preemptive analgesia before ETA compared to 19.6 % in the control group (p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed significant reductions in pain in the group that received preemptive-analgesia before ETA guided by pupillometry across BPS [OR = 0.34 (95 % CI: 0.12-0.99), p = 0.048], ESCID [OR = 0.29 (95 % CI: 0.09-0.88), p = 0.030] and PDR [OR = 0.27 (95 % IC: 0.08-0.86), p = 0.027] compared to standard clinical practice.
Preemptive analgesia monitored with pupillometry group had a lower percentage of patients with pain than those who received analgesia based on standard clinical practice. This effect was independent of the sex, patient severity, BIS score, remifentanil use, or preemptive- analgesia.
The requirement for preemptive analgesia before aspiration, evaluated through routine clinical practice, was lower than detected by pupillometric monitoring of patients. The use of pupillometry to monitor preemptive analgesia reduced pain after secretion aspiration. Pupillometry would be an effective tool to individualize the need for preemptive analgesia before potentially painful interventions, applicable to all patients regardless of sex, severity, or sedation level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40010039/

The purpose of this study is to ascertain if BIS correlates with UMSS in determining the sedation level during pediatric drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE).
One-hundred children, aged 36-143 months, with ASA I~II grade, were enrolled. They were subject to general anesthesia for an elective adenotonsillectomy. Two drug regimens were used. After UMSS ≥ 3, the sites of airway obstructions were located by checking the supraglottic airway structures with a fibrous laryngoscope. UMSS scores, BIS values, electromyography (EMG), and signal quality indices (SQIs) were recorded at the pre-medication and pre-DISE baseline (T
There were strong correlations between BIS monitor readings and UMSS scores for total and two regimens. Kappa values revealed moderate agreement between BIS and UMSS for total and two regimens. The agreement rates were 67.47% for the total, 61.43% for Regimen 1, and 73.42% for Regimen 2, respectively.

This has sparked further interest into the exploration and evaluation of methods to achieve an optimal cerebrovascular reactivity measure, where the individual patient is exposed to the lowest insult burden of impaired cerebrovascular reactivity. Recent literature has documented, in neural injury populations, the presence of a potential optimal sedation level in neurocritical care, based on the relationship between cerebrovascular reactivity and quantitative depth of sedation (using bispectral index (BIS)) - termed BISopt. The presence of this measure outside of neural injury patients has yet to be proven.
We explore the relationship between BIS and continuous cerebrovascular reactivity in two cohorts: (A) healthy population undergoing elective spinal surgery under general anesthesia, and (B) healthy volunteer cohort of awake controls.
We demonstrate the presence of BISopt in the general anesthesia population (96% of patients), and its absence in awake controls, providing preliminary validation of its existence outside of neural injury populations. Furthermore, we found BIS to be sufficiently separate from overall systemic blood pressure, this indicates that they impact different pathophysiological phenomena to mediate cerebrovascular reactivity.
Findings here carry implications for the adaptation of the individualized physiologic BISopt concept to non-neural injury populations, both within critical care and the operative theater. However, this work is currently exploratory, and future work is required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436898/

Eighteen subjects were planned to be enrolled into 3 dose groups in turn: group 1 (ciprofol-0.4 mg/kg vs. propofol-2.0 mg/kg), group 2 (ciprofol-0.6 mg/kg vs. propofol-3.0 mg/kg) and group 3 (ciprofol-0.8 mg/kg vs. propofol-4.0 mg/kg). They were randomly assigned into a ciprofol or propofol group in a ratio of 1:1, with sequences of ciprofol-propofol or propofol-ciprofol, separated with a washout period of at least 48 h.
A total of 19 subjects were enrolled and 18 completed the trial. The median time to being fully alert after induction by ciprofol was longer than for propofol. The bispectral index (BIS) recovered significantly slower with ciprofol than with propofol 5 min and 10 min after reaching its lowest points. Systolic blood pressure (group 1: p=0.041; group 2: p=0.015; group 3: p=0.004) and mean arterial pressures (group 1: p=0.026; group 2: p=0.015; group 3: p=0.004) measured by the area under the curve below the baseline during the 2 min after induction were significantly less for ciprofol compared to propofol, but a significant change in diastolic blood pressure was only observed in group 3 (p=0.002). Eighteen (100.0%) subjects experienced 47 ciprofol-related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and 17 (94.4%) subjects had 54 propofol-related TEAEs, which were mainly hypotension, involuntary movements, respiratory depression, and pain at the injection site with severity of grade 1 or 2.

In order to conduct a meta-analysis of articles examining the relationship between the VOTE score and BIS sedation level in determining the presence and severity of upper airway collapse during DISE, a literature review was performed.
As a result of the search made in the specified databases, a total of 1864 articles were reached. Five articles included in this review that had sufficient statistical data to be included in the meta-analysis were found. A statistically significant correlation was found between the BIS sedation level and the areas of obstruction in the VOTE score. The strongest association is at the epiglottis level, followed by the velum, oropharynx, and tongue, respectively (CC: 0.639, CC: 0.53, CC: 0.49, and CC: 0.346, P < .001). In the subgroup analysis of publications with BIS sedation levels in the range of 60 to 65, the distribution in the epiglottis region was heterogeneous, and it was found to be statistically significant according to the random effect model (P < .001). The distribution in the tongue was homogeneous, and it was found to be statistically significant according to the fixed effect model (P < .001). When the publications in which the BIS sedation level is in the range of 65 to 75 are examined according to the areas of obstruction; the distribution in 4 anatomical regions was homogeneous and statistically significant according to the fixed effect model (P < .001).
It was found that BIS sedation levels during DISE application in obstructive sleep apnea patients were associated with obstruction of the anatomical regions of the upper airway. The strongest association was found at the epiglottis level, followed by the velum, oropharynx, and tongue, respectively. It is helpful to monitor the sedation level with BIS in order to better define the collapsed areas during DISE application.

Although it is common that the depth of sedation is assessed by validated instruments such as the modified observer's assessment of alertness and sedation (MOAA/S) score, the repeated stimulation associated with the assessment can affect the sedation. The bispectral index (BIS) has been widely used for general anesthesia due to its objective and noninvasive nature. However, the utility of BIS monitoring and a target BIS value for use during bronchoscopy have not been fully elucidated.
We performed a retrospective observational study to assess the utility of the BIS value for monitoring conscious sedation during bronchoscopy at Kobe University Hospital from August 2020 to April 2021.
Eighteen patients underwent bronchoscopy with BIS monitoring. The BIS value significantly correlated with the MOAA/S score (r = 0.2, p < 0.01), and the correlation was stronger in sufficiently sedated patients (r = 0.486, p < 0.01). The lowest MOAA/S score during the procedure was highly correlated with the BIS value (r = 0.625, p < 0.01). The BIS monitoring seemed to be more sensitive to changes in the sedation level than the MOAA/S score, heart rate and mean arterial pressure. The median BIS value at an MOAA/S score of 3-4, the desired depth of sedation, was 82.0.
BIS value is useful for monitoring sedation during bronchoscopy. This study suggests that a BIS value of 82 reflects an adequate level of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36122591/

It has been demonstrated non-inferior to propofol in general anesthesia with regard to efficacy and safety. However, whether general anesthesia with remimazolam is better than propofol in terms of patients' recovery quality remains unknown.
Patients enrolled in this study were randomized to remimazolam or propofol group. In remimazolam group, general anesthesia was induced with remimazolam and sufentanil and maintained with remimazolam and remifentanil. In propofol group, general anesthesia was induced with propofol and sufentanil and maintained with propofol and remifentanil.

The objective of the study was to prove whether ciprofol was non-inferior to propofol for the successful induction of general anesthesia. The ideal post-induction sedation level was assessed by comparing patients' clinical symptoms and their hemodynamic effects in responding to noxious stimuli, mostly tracheal intubation and bispectral index (BIS) alterations following ciprofol/propofol administration.
In this multi-center, randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial, selective surgery patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either ciprofol 0.4 mg/kg (n = 88) or propofol 2.0 mg/kg (n = 88) groups. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with successful anesthesia inductions. Secondary endpoints included the times to successful induction of general anesthesia and loss of the eyelash reflex, changes in BIS, as well as safety indicators.
The anesthesia induction success rates for both ciprofol 0.4 mg/kg and propofol 2 mg/kg groups were 100.0%, with a 95% CI lower success limit of -4.18% difference between the two groups, indicating that ciprofol was non-inferior to propofol. For secondary outcomes, the average time to successful anesthesia and loss of the eyelash reflex were 0.91 min and 0.80 min for ciprofol and 0.80 min and 0.71 min for propofol, respectively. The pattern of BIS changes with ciprofol was similar to propofol and stable during the anesthesia maintenance period. Safety was comparable with 88.6% TEAEs in the ciprofol group compared to 95.5% in the propofol group. The incidence of injection pain was significantly lower in the ciprofol group compared to the propofol group (6.8% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.05). In addition, the patients treated with ciprofol had a lesser increase in blood pressure and heart rate, and fewer cases with BIS > 60 within 15 min of intravenous administration, which indicated that ciprofol may provide a better ideal sedation level during the post-induction period under an equivalent dosing regimen to propofol.

However, external environmental factors, such as bright surgical lights, may hamper patient relaxation, which may lead to an increase in the dose of midazolam required and the likelihood of adverse drug effects. We investigated whether using an eye mask to block the external environment could reduce midazolam requirements during spinal anesthesia.
Participants aged 18-‒80 years, scheduled for elective surgery under spinal anesthesia, were randomly divided into a masked group (wearing eye masks during surgery, n = 20) and a control group (no mask, n = 18). The sedation level was assessed using a modified Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (MOAA/S) scale. Midazolam (1 mg) was incrementally administered every 5 min until moderate sedation (MOAA/S score of 3) was achieved. The bispectral index (BIS) was monitored, and the onset and maintenance times of a BIS < 80 were recorded.
The two groups had similar demographic characteristics. The midazolam requirements were significantly lower in the masked group than in the control group (2.8 mg vs. 3.7 mg, P = 0.024). However, the onset and maintenance times for a BIS < 80 were similar. In addition, there were no significant differences in the incidence of side effects or patient satisfaction between the two groups.

However, the distinct EEG dynamic characteristics at comparable sedation levels have not been well studied, resulting in potential interpretation errors in EEG monitoring during sedation. We aimed to analyze the EEG dynamics of dexmedetomidine and propofol at comparable sedation levels and to explore EEG changes with increased sedation levels for each agent. We measured the Bispectral Index (BIS) and 20-channel EEG under dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation from wakefulness, moderate sedation, and deep sedation to recovery in healthy volunteers (n = 10) in a randomized, 2-day, crossover study. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels. Despite similar changes in increased delta oscillations, multiple differences in the EEG spatiotemporal dynamics were observed between these two agents. During moderate sedation, both dexmedetomidine and propofol induced increased spindle power; however, dexmedetomidine decreased the global alpha/beta/gamma power, whereas propofol decreased the alpha power in the occipital area and increased the global spindle/beta/gamma power. During deep sedation, dexmedetomidine was associated with increased fronto-central spindle power and decreased global alpha/beta/gamma power, but propofol was associated with increased theta/alpha/spindle/beta power, which was maximized in the frontal area. The transition of topographic alpha/spindle/beta power distribution from moderate sedation to deep sedation completely differed between these two agents. Our study demonstrated that there was a distinct hierarchy of EEG changes with increased sedation depths by propofol and dexmedetomidine. Differences in EEG dynamics at the same sedation level might account for differences in the BIS value and reflect the different sedation mechanisms.

Skin conductance variability, selected hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, bispectral index (BIS) and ambient noise level, were monitored during 4 hour routine daytime intensive care nursing and treatment in an adult Intensive Care Unit. 4h-measurements were divided into 2 groups, based upon the sedation level (group A: Ramsay sedation scale 2-4 and group B: 5-6 respectively) of the patients. Selected recordings before and after endotracheal suction (stress events) were performed. Seven stress events from Group A and 17 from Group B were included for further analysis. Patients' demographics, laboratory exams and severity scores were recorded. Pain status evaluation before every event was also performed via 2 independent observers.
In both groups the rate of EDA changes was greater than in other monitoring parameters. Yet, in group A only selected parameters were significantly changed after the start of the procedure, while in group B, every parameter showed significant change (p<0.05). Groups were similar for other co-founding factors.
EDA measurements are more sensitive to stress stimuli, than cardiovascular, respiratory or even BIS monitoring. Deeper sedation seems to affect more the intensity of EDA changes during suction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29668462/

This study was carried out in order to evaluate different methods of assessment of depth of sedation: bispectral index (BiS), modified Richmond Agitation/Sedation Scale (mRASS), modified Ramsay Sedation Scale (mRSS) and modified Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (mOAAS) and their applicability to clinical practice.
Two hundred patients were recruited. Sedation was given by standard clinical practice using propofol sedation or patient controlled sedation. Sedation was assessed on all patients using the above-mentioned methods. BiS was considered the reference point for sedation scales. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to determine the consistency of different scales in respect to each other and prediction probability and Spearman's correlation coefficients of sedation scales were calculated to show the relationship between sedation scales and BiS.
All scales showed high reliability with overall Cronbach's alpha 0.943. Dropping scales suggested better consistency between mOAAS, mRSS and mRASS than with BiS. Spearman's correlation and prediction probability showed similar results with all tested scales: mOAAS (0.695, 0.739), mRSS (0.673, 0.735), mRASS (0.683, 0.738), p < .01 for all scales.
All tested methods were found to be reliable in the assessment of the depth of sedation when compared with each other. However, mRASS, mRSS and mOAAS require the patient to respond to verbal or tactile stimulus, which may impair execution of ERCP, whereas BiS information is collected directly from electroencephalogram and thus may be preferable in clinical setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29411681/

Yet, types of sedation assessment tools and sedation levels that are suitable for sedation treatment have not been investigated.
To investigate the influence of different sedation levels guided by the Bispectral Index (BIS) on the therapeutic effects for severe TBI.
According to inclusion, exclusion, and rejection criteria, 35 patients were prospectively included and divided into Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), BIS(I), and BIS(II) groups. The RASS group was controlled the level of sedation to within -2 or -3, and the BIS(I) and (II) groups within the range of 40-50 and 50-60, respectively. In addition to clinical data, RASS, BIS, and intracranial pressure (ICP) values were collected. RASS and ICP variability were introduced to investigate the different of sedative control effect with or without BIS monitor, and the control effect of ICP between different sedation levels. Statistical analysis was performed to estimate the effectiveness of different sedation levels guided by BIS in sedation treatment within 72 hours.
There were no significant differences in demographics among the 3 groups. RASS variability of the BIS(I) and (II) groups was significantly lower than that of the RASS group (P < 0.05), and in the BIS(I) group it was insignificantly lower than in the BIS(II) group. The ICP of the BIS(I) and (II) groups declined to <13.5 mm Hg significantly earlier than that of the RASS group (P < 0.05), and the difference between BIS(I) and (II) was insignificant. ICP variability of RASS group was higher than those of the BIS(I) and (II) groups (P < 0.05), and ICP variability of the BIS(I) group was significantly lower than that of the BIS(II) group (P < 0.05). Differences in days in the neurosurgery intensive care unit and outcomes among the 3 groups were insignificant.
BIS is more reliable than RASS for maintaining a stable sedation status and ICP. Deeper sedation levels (BIS 40-50) cause ICP to decrease more quickly, with lower ICP variability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29196250/

The aim of this prospective study is to characterize the level of consciousness in patients undergoing PS using Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring.
We enrolled consecutive patients with refractory symptoms requiring PS. We documented the level of sedation using Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) and BIS at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h during the first day of PS and examined their degree of association. Intravenous midazolam or propofol was titrated according to the sedation level.
Twenty patients on PS were recruited and had BIS continuous monitoring. Delirium was the most frequent reason for PS (n = 15, 75%). The median time of sedation was 24.5 h (interquartile range 6-46). The average time to achieve the desired sedation level was 6 h, and dose titration was required in 80% of the cases. At baseline, 14 (70%) patients were considered to be awake according to RSS (i.e., 1-3) and 19 (95%) were awake according to BIS (i.e., >60%). This proportion decreased to 31 and 56% at 4 h, 27% and 53 at 6 h, and 22 and 33% at 24 h. RS and BIS had moderate correlation (rho = -0.58 to -0.65); however, a small proportion of patients were found to be awake by BIS (i.e., ≥60%) despite clinical observation (i.e., RSS 4-6) indicating otherwise.

To determine the feasibility and validity of BIS monitoring in terminally ill patients.
In this prospective study, BIS registrations were performed in unconscious end-of-life patients admitted to a palliative care center. Validated scores were used to measure level of sedation (Ramsay score), pain (Numeric Rating Scale or Rotterdam Elderly Pain Observations Scale), delirium (Delirium Observation Screening score), and overall comfort (Numeric Rating Scale). Validity and sensitivity to change of BIS values were considered, and the effects of medication and the time till death on BIS values were evaluated in a linear mixed model analysis.
Fifty-eight patients were included for analysis. BIS monitoring was acceptable to patients, relatives, and medical staff. BIS values were moderately correlated with Ramsay scores (0.46) but were highly variable for deeply sedated patients. BIS values changed significantly before and after a midazolam dose (P < 0.001). Midazolam treatment resulted on average in a statistically significant reduction of the BIS values (-4.5, 95% CI -7.0 to -2.0), whereas morphine and haloperidol did not.
This is one of the first validation studies in which BIS monitoring in end-of-life patients is described. BIS monitoring is feasible in unconscious terminally ill patients.

So far, a dose-response relationship between sedation and collapsibility has not been demonstrated.
DISE and SimS were performed in 60 consecutive patients with SDB under monitoring of depth of sedation by BiSpectral Index® (BIS). Initially, SimS was conducted followed by DISE using bolus application of propofol. Sedation was performed up to a sedation level representing slow wave sleep (BIS = 40). The collapsibility of the upper airway was documented at decreasing sedation levels by an identical pictogram classification.
For all levels and patterns of obstruction, a dose-dependent increase in the collapsibility of the upper airway was detected. A maximum collapsibility was achieved at sedation levels representing slow wave sleep. The collapsibility during SimS corresponded to light sleep stages and did not cover slow wave sleep.

Preliminary tests were performed a week prior to scanning to determine target effect site concentrations based on BIS and concomitant Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scores while under propofol. Within one week of the preliminary tests where propofol dose-response was established, BOLD-fMRI was conducted to examine brain activation with the subject awake, and with propofol infusion at the sedation level.
Mild propofol sedation inhibited left inferior parietal lobe activation. Deep sedation inhibited activation of the left insula, left superior temporal gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus.

This was a prospective observational trial with waiver of consent conducted in the intensive care unit of Level I trauma center in 94 mechanically ventilated trauma patients sedated with propofol alone or in combination with midazolam. BIS, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), electromyography, and heart rate variability, as a test of autonomic function, were measured for 45 minutes during daily SATs. Data were evaluated with analysis of variance, linear regression, and nonparametric tests.
The BIS wave form coincided almost exactly with propofol on/off. Steady-state BIS correlated with RASS (p < 0.0001) and with propofol dose (p < 0.0001), but the strengths of association were relatively low (all r(2) < 0.5). BIS wave form was not altered by age, heart rate, or heart rate variability and was similar with propofol alone or propofol plus midazolam, but the presence of brain injury or the use of paralytics shifted the curve downward (both p < 0.001).

The predictive ability (P(k)) of AAI/2, BIS, and IoC with respect to the sedation level, RSS score, was also explored.
Data from 110 patients were analyzed in the training group. The resulting estimated models had an MDAPE of 32.87, 12.89, and 8.77; an MDRMSE of 17.01, 12.81, and 9.40; and an MDPE of -1.86, 3.97, and 2.21 for AAI/2, BIS, and IoC, respectively, in the absence of stimulation and similar values under stimulation. P(k) values were 0.82, 0.81, and 0.85 for AAI/2, BIS, and IoC, respectively. The model predicted the prospective validation data with an MDAPE of 34.81, 14.78, and 10.25; an MDRMSE of 16.81, 15.91, and 11.81; an MDPE of -8.37, 5.65, and -1.43; and P(k) values of 0.81, 0.8, and 0.8 for AAI/2, BIS, and IoC, respectively.
A model relating C(e)pro and C(e)remi to AAI/2, BIS, and IoC has been developed and prospectively validated. Based on these models, the (C(e)pro, C(e)remi) concentration pairs that provide an RSS score of 4 range from (1.8 μg·mL(-1), 1.5 ng·mL(-1)) to (2.7 μg·mL(-1), 0 ng·mL(-1)). These concentrations are associated with AAI/2 values of 25 to 30, BIS of 71 to 75, and IoC of 72 to 76. The presence of noxious stimulation increases the requirements of C(e)pro and C(e)remi to achieve the same degree of sedative effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21131550/
21104443,The role of the ADRA2A C1291G genetic polymorphism in response to dexmedetomidine on patients undergoing coronary artery surgery.,Molecular biology reports,2011,"Yağar S, Yavaş S, Karahalil B","The existence of interindividual drug response variability has been known for a long time. Individual susceptibility which might cause toxicity or inadequate treatment is important in drug therapy. Genetic polymorphisms in genes responsible for drug response are expected to be useful in keeping track of differences among individuals. Dexmedetomidine is a sedative drug, whose use in intensive care unit patients was confirmed by USA-Food Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of 1999. It was proven that dexmedetomidine shows its clinic effect via the α(2)-AR. However, to the best of our knowledge, to date, there is no investigation in clinic indicating the relation between dexmedetomidine and α(2A)-AR gene polymorphism. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between the effect of α(2A)-Adrenergic Receptor (ADRA2A) C-1291G gene polymorphism in the promoter region of the candidate gene and clinical effects (sedative and haemodynamics effects) of dexmedetomidine. One hundred and ten patients undergoing coronary artery surgery were prospectively studied. Anesthetic technique was standardized with fentanyl, midazolam and rocuronium bromide. Patients were monitorized with Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor in addition to the routine invasive haemodynamic monitorization in the operation room. The Ramsay Sedation Scale was also used in order to determine the sedation level just arriving to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The genotyping of ADRA2A C1291G was done by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RFLP-PCR). We found the frequencies of C1291C, C1291G and G1291G genotypes, as 43.6, 45.5 and 10.9%, respectively. Patients who carry variant genotype had higher BIS and Ramsay Sedation Scores, indicating a longer period for falling asleep. The results of our study are promising, considering the association between ADRA2A polymorphism and response to dexmedetomidine. However, further investigations on other ADRA2A locus or haplotypes might be useful to clarify the relation between this gene and dexmedetomidine activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21104443/

Prospective, observational study.
Operating room of a university medical center.
40 elderly patients (>or=65 yrs of age) undergoing hip fracture repair with spinal anesthesia and propofol-based sedation.
In the routine practice group (RP; n = 15), propofol sedation was administered per the usual routine of the anesthesiologist. In the targeted sedation group (TS; n = 25), sedation was titrated to an observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score of 4 (ie, lethargic in response to name called) to 5 (ie, awake and alert).
Both patient groups underwent processed electroencephalographic monitoring using bispectral index (BIS) intraoperatively. BIS levels were compared between groups to determine amount of surgical time spent in GA (BIS <or= 60).
In the RP group, subjects spent 32.2% of surgical time at BIS levels consistent with GA. Although averaged BIS values during surgery increased from (mean +/- SD) 71 +/- 16 to 88 +/- 9 (P < 0.001), GA was still observed during 5% of surgical time in the TS group. Overall, 13 of 15 (87%) RP group patients and 11 of 25 (44%) TS group patients (P < 0.010) experienced some period of GA.
BIS levels consistent with GA occur frequently in elderly patients during propofol-based sedation for spinal anesthesia. Altering routine practice such that sedation is titrated to a targeted clinically-determined sedation level reduces - but does not eliminate - this incidence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20400003/

Thirty candidates for elective hand surgery were pre-medicated with midazolam 0.06 mg/kg and atropine 0.01 mg/kg. Sedation was induced with intravenous propofol and fentanyl was also administered. The Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAA/S) was used to determine sedation level and pain was maintained at < 4 on a 0 - 10 verbal rating scale. The BIS, entropy, MOAA/S and pain values were recorded before initiation of sedation (control), during initiation of sedation, during surgery, and for 30 min after the end of surgery and anaesthesia. On initiation of sedation, entropy decreased more rapidly than BIS. At 10 min after initiation of sedation, the mean +/- SD values for MOAA/S, BIS, RE and SE were 3.00 +/- 0.36, 85.45 +/- 0.15, 74.00 +/- 0.60 and 72.02 +/- 0.12, respectively.

Both SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) gradually decreased during maintenance administration and were significantly lower than pretreatment values. The heart rate decreased immediately after the start of administration and was significantly lower during both initial loading and maintenance administration; the heart rate was also significantly lower than that in Group P. In Group D, arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) significantly decreased after the sedation level reached an optimum level until the end of administration. The bispectral index (BIS) value gradually decreased during initial loading. At the optimal sedation level, it decreased to 80 to 85. During maintenance administration, marked changes were observed in this parameter. No marked differences in amnestic effects and comfort were noted between the 2 groups.

Because clinical assessment of depth of sedation is labor-intensive, performed only intermittently, and interferes with sedation and sleep, processed electrophysiological signals from the brain have gained interest as surrogates. We hypothesized that auditory event-related potentials (ERPs), Bispectral Index (BIS), and Entropy can discriminate among clinically relevant sedation levels.
We studied 10 patients after elective thoracic or abdominal surgery with general anesthesia. Electroencephalogram, BIS, state entropy (SE), response entropy (RE), and ERPs were recorded immediately after surgery in the intensive care unit at Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores of -5 (very deep sedation), -4 (deep sedation), -3 to -1 (moderate sedation), and 0 (awake) during decreasing target-controlled sedation with propofol and remifentanil. Reference measurements for baseline levels were performed before or several days after the operation.
At baseline, RASS -5, RASS -4, RASS -3 to -1, and RASS 0, BIS was 94 [4] (median, IQR), 47 [15], 68 [9], 75 [10], and 88 [6]; SE was 87 [3], 46 [10], 60 [22], 74 [21], and 87 [5]; and RE was 97 [4], 48 [9], 71 [25], 81 [18], and 96 [3], respectively (all P < 0.05, Friedman Test). Both BIS and Entropy had high variabilities. When ERP N100 amplitudes were considered alone, ERPs did not differ significantly among sedation levels. Nevertheless, discriminant ERP analysis including two parameters of principal component analysis revealed a prediction probability PK value of 0.89 for differentiating deep sedation, moderate sedation, and awake state. The corresponding PK for RE, SE, and BIS was 0.88, 0.89, and 0.85, respectively.
Neither ERPs nor BIS or Entropy can replace clinical sedation assessment with standard scoring systems. Discrimination among very deep, deep to moderate, and no sedation after general anesthesia can be provided by ERPs and processed electroencephalograms, with similar P(K)s. The high inter- and intraindividual variability of Entropy and BIS precludes defining a target range of values to predict the sedation level in critically ill patients using these parameters.

Ten healthy volunteers were sedated in a stepwise manner with doses of either midazolam and remifentanil or dexmedetomidine and remifentanil. One week later the procedure was repeated with the remaining drug combination. The doses were adjusted to achieve three different sedation levels (Ramsay Scores 2, 3 and 4) and controlled by a computer-driven drug-delivery system to maintain stable plasma concentrations of the drugs. At each level of sedation, BIS and Entropy (response entropy and state entropy) values were recorded for 20 minutes. Baseline recordings were obtained before the sedative medications were administered.
Both inter-individual and intra-individual variability increased as the sedation level deepened. Entropy values showed greater variability than BIS(R) values, and the variability was greater during dexmedetomidine/remifentanil sedation than during midazolam/remifentanil sedation.
The large intra-individual and inter-individual variability of BIS and Entropy values in sedated volunteers makes the determination of sedation levels by processed electroencephalogram (EEG) variables impossible. Reports in the literature which draw conclusions based on processed EEG variables obtained from sedated intensive care unit (ICU) patients may be inaccurate due to this variability.

The objective of the present study was to observe correlation between an established subjective measure, the Ramsay Sedation Scale, and two objective tools for monitoring critically ill patients: the Bispectral Index (BIS) and auditory evoked potential. Ninety patients undergoing major surgery scheduled for postoperative mechanical ventilation and continuous sedation with propofol and fentanyl were selected. Electrodes for determining BIS and auditory evoked potential were placed on the foreheads of all patients according to manufacturer's specifications at least six hours after patients' arrival at the intensive care unit. Ramsay Sedation Scale, BIS, signal quality index, composite A-line autoregressive index (AAI) and electromyographic activities were recorded every five minutes for 30 minutes. BIS and AAI showed good correlation amongst readings (r(s)=0.697, P <0.01). Both were significantly influenced by electromyographic activities (BIS, r(s)=0.735, P <0.01; AAI, r(s)=0.856, P <0.01). Comparison of BIS and AAI revealed an acceptable correlation between electroencephalogram variables and the Ramsay Sedation Scale (BIS, tau=-0.689; AAI, tau=-0.621; P <0.01). In conclusion, the auditory evoked potential and BIS monitors revealed an acceptable correlation with the Ramsay Sedation Scale.

This was a randomized, prospective study of adults undergoing procedural sedation (PS) with propofol for fracture or dislocation reduction in the ED between July 2003 and March 2004. Patients were randomized to a target sedation level of moderate or deep, using American Society of Anesthesiologists' definitions. Doses, vital signs, nasal end tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)), pulse oximetry, and bispectral EEG analysis (BIS) scores were recorded. Respiratory depression was defined as a change in ETCO(2) >10, an oxygen saturation of <90% at any time, or an absent ETCO(2) waveform at any time. After the procedure, patients were asked if they perceived any pain or had any recall of the procedure. Physicians were asked to rate the difficulty of completing the reduction using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Respiratory depression rates were compared with chi-square tests, BIS and VAS scores were compared with t tests. Seventy-five patients were enrolled, 39 randomized to the target of moderate PS and 36 to the target of deep PS. No significant complications were noted. There were 25/36 (69%) of the patients assigned to the deep sedation target group who actually achieved a deep level of sedation and 21/39 (54%) of the patients assigned to the moderate sedation target group who actually achieved a moderate level of sedation (p = 0.40). Respiratory depression was seen in 19/39 (49%) patients with the moderate PS target and 18/36 (50%) with the deep PS target (p = 0.91). The mean minimum recorded BIS score was 67.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 62.2-73.3) for the moderate PS target group and 59.2 (95% CI 55.1-64.2) for the deep PS target group (p = 0.03). There were 12/39 (31%) in the moderate PS target group and 4/36 (11%) in the deep PS target group who reported pain with or recall of the procedure (p = 0.04).

In this study, the assignment of a pre-procedural target sedation level of moderate or deep PS did not influence the level of sedation achieved, the rate of respiratory depression, the occurrence of complications, the time to return of baseline mental status, or the success of the procedure.

Recently, devices that estimate depth of consciousness have been introduced in an attempt to better titrate anesthesia, however the effect of N(2)O on these monitors is unclear.
General anesthesia was induced and titrated to maintain normal blood pressure and pulse in healthy adults. Data were collected in three 10 minute intervals (Sevo, Sevo + N(2)O, Sevo). In Phase A, sevoflurane concentration was held constant during the N(2)O trial in 60 subjects monitored with either BIS, PSI, or Entropy. In Phase B, sevoflurane concentration was reduced as N(2)O was added, maintaining a constant overall ""MAC"" in 20 subjects monitored concurrently with BIS and Entropy. Sample size for both phases was designed to detect a 10 unit change in measure of processed EEG with alpha = .05 and statistical power = .80.
In Phase A, supplementing sevoflurane with > 65% N(2)O increased MAC from 1.3 +/- 0.05 to 2.2 +/- 0.10, but did not significantly alter BIS nor PSI (p-value for differential MAC is < 0.05). Entropy, however, dropped significantly, with a change in state entropy (SE) from 31.1 +/- 7.3 to 18.9 +/- 3.7 and a corresponding rise when N(2)O was discontinued.

A good correlation between Ramsay score and BIS values was observed. At the deeper levels of sedation a wide range of BIS values corresponds to Ramsay score 6, indicating various levels of central nervous system depression that are not identified by clinical evaluation.

The proposed technique is based on the analysis of a single-channel (frontal) electroencephalogram (EEG) signal using stationary wavelet transform (SWT). The wavelet coefficients calculated from the EEG are pooled into a statistical representation, which is then compared to two well-defined states: the awake state with normal EEG activity, and the isoelectric state with maximal cortical depression. The resulting index, referred to as the wavelet-based anesthetic value for central nervous system monitoring (WAV(CNS)), quantifies the depth of consciousness between these two extremes. To validate the proposed technique, we present a clinical study which explores the advantages of the WAV(CNS) in comparison with the BIS monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, MA), currently a reference in consciousness monitoring. Results show that the WAV(CNS) and BIS are well correlated (r = 0.969) during periods of steady-state despite fundamental algorithmic differences. However, in terms of dynamic behavior, the WAV(CNS) offers faster tracking of transitory changes at induction and emergence, with an average lead of 15-30 s. Furthermore, and conversely to the BIS, the WAV(CNS) regains its preinduction baseline value when patients are responding to verbal command after emergence from anesthesia. We conclude that the proposed analysis technique is an attractive alternative to BIS monitoring. In addition, we show that the WAV(CNS) dynamics can be modeled as a linear time invariant transfer function. This index is, therefore, well suited for use as a feedback sensor in advisory systems, closed-loop control schemes, and for the identification of the pharmacodynamic models of anesthetic drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16602568/
21302218,Increased dosage of propofol in anesthesia induction cannot control the patient's responses to insertion of a laryngeal mask airway.,The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,2006,"Kanazawa M, Nitta M, Murata T, Suzuki T","An increased dosage of propofol is frequently administered to reduce responses to insertion of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA). However, its clinical effect remains unknown. We investigated whether an increased dosage of propofol reduces responses to LMA insertion. Sixty adult patients were divided into 3 groups according to induction dosage of propofol (2.0 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg). The patient's responses including body movement and the upper airway reflex were observed. The bispectral index (BIS) score as the index of the sedation level was monitored. There were no significant differences among the three groups in responses to LMA insertion, and no correlation was seen between the BIS score and the responses. These results suggest that propofol alone at clinical dosage levels does not completely control responses to LMA insertion. It is also suggested that the monitoring of BIS score is not effective in predicting responses to LMA insertion. Combination of propofol and analgesics such as fentanyl may be useful in reducing responses to LMA insertion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21302218/
16192535,Can electroencephalographic analysis be used to determine sedation levels in critically ill patients?,Anesthesia and analgesia,2005,"Roustan JP, Valette S, Aubas P, Rondouin G, Capdevila X","Prolonged use of sedative drugs frequently leads to oversedation of intensive care patients. Clinical assessment scales are not reliable in deeply sedated patients. Parameters obtained from spectral and bispectral analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) records have been combined to create an index (BIS) to monitor anesthesia depth. The role of such parameters in monitoring the depth of the sedation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients has yet to be determined. We designed the present prospective study to redefine and calculate available spectral and bispectral parameters from raw EEG records and estimate their clinical relevance for the diagnosis of under- or oversedation levels in ICU patients. Forty adult patients receiving continuous midazolam and morphine sedation were included. We obtained 167 clinical evaluations of sedation level using Ramsay and COMFORT scales along with an EEG record of 300 s. Six spectral parameters-relative power of 4 frequency bands (beta, alpha, Theta, and delta), 95th percentile of the power spectrum (SEF95), and 50th percentile of the power spectrum (SEF50) and four bispectral parameters, real triple product, bispectrum (Bispectrum), bicoherence, and ratio 10-were calculated. The relevance of each of these parameters and combinations in predicting too light (Ramsay 1 and 2) or deep (Ramsay 5 and 6) sedation levels was assessed. These calculations were performed before and after exclusion of the agitated patients, whose COMFORT 4 score was above 2. The most relevant parameters for predicting levels of deep sedation (Ramsay 5 and 6) were ratio 10 (area under the curve = 0.763; 95% confidence interval, 0.679-0.833) and SEF95 (area under the curve = 0.687; 95% confidence interval, 0.597-0.767). The most relevant parameters for predicting light levels of sedation (Ramsay 1 and 2) were also ratio 10 (area under the curve = 0.829; 95% confidence interval, 0.695-0.917) and SEF95 (area under the curve = 0.798; 95% confidence interval, 0.650-0.898). There is a modest improvement in relevance of their linear combination in predicting sedation level. Results were similar after exclusion of agitated patients. We conclude that various calculated EEG descriptive parameters exhibited large interindividual variability. There was a strong correlation between EEG spectral and bispectral parameters. Bispectral analysis slightly improves the predictive power of simple spectral analysis in distinguishing too light or deep sedation levels in ICU patients.
Spectral edge frequency 95 and Ratio 10 are the most relevant electroencephalogram (EEG) indexes for monitoring the level of sedation in intensive care unit patients but calculated EEG values exhibited large interindividual variability. Bispectral analysis of EEG provides a slight improvement over simple spectral analysis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16192535/

Fifty-four ASA physical status I-II patients, scheduled for elective septo-rhinoplastic surgery, were included in the study. Subjects were assigned to receive either music (music group; n = 28) or no music (control group; n = 26) during the preoperative period. Sedative premedication was provided with midazolam 0.08 mg/kg IM. Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scales (OAAS) scores and BIS values were recorded at specific time intervals. In the control group, there were more patients with an OAAS score of 1 than in the music group at 30 min after midazolam injection. In addition, there were more patients with an OAAS score of 2 in the control group than in the music group at 30-50 min. However, there were significantly more patients with an OAAS score of 3 in the music group than in the control group at 20-50 min. BIS values of the music group were also smaller than the control group at 30 and 40 min. BIS values were significantly decreased from baseline values at 10-50 min in the music group, whereas BIS values decreased at 30-50 min in the control group. In conclusion, listening to music during midazolam premedication is associated with an increase in sedation level in the preoperative period as reflected by a lower BIS value.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15976214/

The Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Entropy Module (Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium Corp., Helsinki, Finland) was the first commercial monitor based on the entropy generating two indices, the state entropy (SE) and the response entropy (RE). The aim of the current study was to compare the accuracy of SE and RE with the Bispectral Index(R) monitor (BIS(R); Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) during propofol-remifentanil anesthesia.
The authors investigated 20 female patients during minor gynecologic surgery. SE, RE, BIS, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and sedation level were recorded every 20 s during stepwise increase (target-controlled infusion, 0.5 microg/ml) of propofol until the patients lost response. Five minutes after loss of response, remifentanil infusion (0.4 microg . kg(-1) . min(-1)) was started. Spearman correlation coefficient and prediction probability were calculated for sedation levels with SE, RE, BIS, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate. The ability of the investigated parameters to distinguish between the anesthesia steps awake versus loss of response, awake versus anesthesia, anesthesia versus first reaction, and anesthesia versus extubation was analyzed with the prediction probability.
SE correlates best with sedation levels, but no significant differences of the prediction probability values among SE, RE, and BIS were found. The prediction probability for all investigated steps of anesthesia did not show significant differences among SE, RE, and BIS. SE, RE, and BIS were superior to mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate.
SE, RE, and BIS revealed similar information about the level of sedation and allowed the authors to distinguish between different steps of anesthesia. Both monitors provided useful additional information for the anesthesiologist.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15564934/

Recent evidence suggests that spinal cord anaesthesia modifies reticulo-thalamo-cortical arousal by decreasing afferent sensory transmission. We hypothesized that epidural anaesthesia produces sensory deafferentation-dependent sedation that is associated with impairment of brainstem transmission. We used brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) to evaluate reticular function in 11 volunteers.
Epidural anaesthesia was induced with 2-chloroprocaine 2%. Haemodynamic and respiratory responses, sensory block level, sedation depth and BAEP were assessed throughout induction and resolution of epidural anaesthesia. Sedation was evaluated using verbal rating score (VRS), observer's assessment alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score, and bispectral index score (BIS). Prediction probability (PK) was used to associate sensory block with sedation, as well as BIS with other sedation measures. Spearman's rank order correlation was used to associate block level and sedation with the absolute and interpeak BAEP latencies.
Sensory block level significantly predicted VRS (PK=0.747), OAA/S score (PK=0.748) and BIS. BIS predicted VRS and OAA/S score (PK=0.728). The latency of wave III of BAEP significantly correlated with sedation level (rho=0.335, P<0.01) and sensory block (rho=0.394, P<0.01). The other BAEP parameters did not change during epidural anaesthesia. Haemodynamic and respiratory responses remained stable throughout the study.
Sedation during epidural anaesthesia depends on sensory block level and is associated with detectable block-dependent alterations in the brainstem auditory evoked responses. Sensory deafferentation may reduce CNS alertness through mechanisms related to brainstem neural activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15220178/

Investigated states of anesthesia were: awake, loss of response, loss of eyelash reflex, steady-state anesthesia, first reaction, and extubation during emergence. NT, BIS, spectral edge frequency, median frequency, relative power in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and hemodynamics were recorded simultaneously. The ability of all variables to distinguish between awake versus loss of response, awake versus loss of eyelash reflex, awake versus steady-state anesthesia, steady-state anesthesia versus first reaction and extubation were analyzed with the prediction probability. Effects of remifentanil during propofol infusion were investigated with Friedman's and post hoc with Wilcoxon's test. Only NT and BIS were able to distinguish all investigated states accurately with a prediction probability >0.95. After start of remifentanil infusion, only hemodynamics changed statistically significantly (P < 0.05). NT and BIS are more reliable indicators for the assessment of anesthetic states than classical electroencephalographic variables and hemodynamics, whereas the analgesic potency of depth of anesthesia could not be detected by NT and BIS.

The purpose of this study was to assess the depth of sedation administered to children in four locations using the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS).
Eighty-six children under the age of 12 years undergoing procedures with conscious or deep sedation were enrolled. The study included patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, computerized tomography imaging, gastrointestinal endoscopy, and dental procedures. Sedation for each procedure was based on departmental protocols and preferences; the study did not dictate choice or dose of drugs. An independent observer applied the UMSS sedation scale at 10 min intervals for 1 h. The observer and the personnel administering sedation were blinded to the BIS score, which was recorded continuously.
The goal of either conscious or deep sedation was attained in 53% (BIS) and 72% (UMSS) of patients. Depth consistent with general anaesthesia was observed in 35% (BIS) and 0% (UMSS), and an awake state was observed in 12% (BIS) and 28% (UMSS). About 8% of patients experienced desaturation and airway events associated with deeper levels of sedation.
Our data demonstrate wide variations in depth of sedation attained in the hospital. The goal of either conscious or deep sedation was not achieved in a significant number of children.

However, the usefulness of a parameter derived from the electroencephalogram for clinical anesthesia largely depends on its ability to predict the response to stimuli of different intensity or painfulness under a combination of a hypnotic and an (opioid) analgesic. This study was designed to evaluate the predictive performance of spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), BIS, and approximate entropy for the response to increasingly intense stimuli under different concentrations of both propofol and remifentanil in the therapeutic range.
Ten healthy male and ten healthy female volunteers were studied during coadministration of propofol and remifentanil. After having maintained a specific target concentration for 10 min, the depth of sedation-anesthesia was assessed using the responsiveness component of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) rating scale, which was modified by adding insertion of a laryngeal mask and laryngoscopy. The electroencephalogram derived parameters approximate entropy, bispectral index, and SEF95 were recorded just before sedation level was assessed.
The prediction probability values for approximate entropy were slightly, but not significantly, better than those for bispectral index, SEF95, and the combination of drug concentrations. A much lower prediction ability was observed for tolerance of airway manipulation than for hypnotic endpoints.
Approximate entropy revealed informations on hypnotic and analgesic endpoints using coadministration of propofol and remifentanil comparable to bispectral index, SEF95, and the combination of drug concentrations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12606904/

We examined the correlation between 1) the clinically assessed state of consciousness, 2) implicit and explicit memory (by use of word pairs), and 3) various measures of EEG and AEP-bispectral index (BIS), A-Line ARX AEP index, spectral entropy, and entropy of the singular value decomposition (SVDEN; a measure of the complexity of the EEG). We studied 21 women during a two-stage awakening (sevoflurane washout followed by remifentanil washout) after anesthesia for gynecological surgery. All were amnesic, and 19 were unresponsive to verbal command with remifentanil alone. In six patients, BIS decreased paradoxically as the remifentanil concentration decreased; this was caused by a low-amplitude EEG, which was misinterpreted by the Aspect algorithm as burst suppression. Most of the EEG/AEP variables were sensitive to the decrease in sevoflurane and the recovery of consciousness, but not to the effects of decreasing remifentanil concentrations. SVDEN was the only variable that demonstrated significant increases for both the sevoflurane and remifentanil washout phases. With the prediction probability statistic during remifentanil washout, SVDEN = 0.79, spectral entropy = 0.81, A-Line ARX AEP index = 0.63, and BIS = 0.58. Entropy measures appear to be worthy of further clinical evaluation in a larger series of patients. SVDEN may be a useful variable for assessing anesthetic and analgesic effects on the central nervous system.
During the recovery phase from a remifentanil-based anesthetic, the bispectral index is not reliably predictive of the depth of consciousness, because of suppression ratio artifacts. Entropy measures of the electroencephalogram show promise, but there is still no gold standard to estimate anesthetic depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12598252/

According to the reports, Bispectral Index correlates with levels of sedation on the Ramsay Scale. We report our personal experience in this topic.
Twenty patients, diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), were involved in the study. For an optimal adaptation to respiratory prothesis, they were sedated (with Propofol by continuous infusion at an initial dose of 2 mg/kg/h, which could be modulated with steps of 0.5 mg/kg/h), in order to maintain a Ramsay score of 4-5. BIS value was continuously recorded, and manually calculated on a mean average of a minute during the measuring of Ramsay score (T0) and every 30' for 24 hours on par with Ramsay score. EEG, SpO2, non invasive arterial pressure, ventilatory module, ETCO2, FIO2 were also recorded. For the statistic analysis, Friedman test and Spearman coefficient were utilized. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.
980 observations were carried out. The variation range of Ramsay Score was between 2 and 6. BIS range varied from 34 to 98.

BIS version 3.12 and clinical depth of sedation assessed by the modified Observers's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale, modified Glasgow Coma Scale, modified Ramsay Scale, Cook Scale, and Sedation-Agitation Scale were measured twice daily while patients were intubated and once daily after extubation until discharged from ICU.

We found no parameters distinguishing between these two groups. On average eight measurements were necessary to establish a statistical correlation. In the BIS patients the slopes of the linear regression curves showed significant differences for all BIS score combinations with increasing scattering at deeper sedation levels.
BIS is correlated only in some ICU patients with the clinical assessment of their sedation level as based on various scores. At deeper sedation levels the interindividual differences increase.

In addition BIS was continuously recorded to establish a baseline value, when the patient was not stimulated. Ventilator settings, medications and vital signs were also recorded.
With the increase of the Ramsay score there was a progressive decrease in the BIS score (Ramsay score=2, BIS=88 +/- 15.1; Ramsay score=6, BIS=52.2 +/- 10.7); between BIS and Propofol dosages and between Ramsay score and systolic pressure.

Fourteen patients underwent hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (32 degrees C, group H), and 14 normothermic CPB (group N). The level of sedation was measured with Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Score and with Ramsay Sedation Score. BIS was the only EEG measurement that paralleled the clinical course of the patients' sedation level. Values (median, 95% confidence intervals (CI)) changed significantly over time in both groups (P<0.0001). In group H, BIS decreased from 97 (95, 99) the day before surgery to 48 (44, 52) after tracheal intubation, to 46 (41, 52) before going off CPB, to 91 (85, 97) immediately before extubation.

11381378,Assessment of recovery in patients undergoing intravenous conscious sedation using bispectral analysis.,Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,2001,"Sandler NA, Hodges J, Sabino M","The Bispectral Index (BIS) has been recently shown to objectively predict the level of sedation in patients undergoing conscious sedation. It was the goal of this study to directly compare the recovery profile of patients where the BIS was used to monitor sedation with a control group where the monitor was not used.
Forty patients undergoing third molar extractions under intravenous conscious sedation were randomly assigned to 2 groups. In both groups, induction of sedation was performed using a standard dose of fentanyl (1.5 microg/kg) and midazolam (0.05 mg/kg). Propofol was then given in 10 to 20 mg boluses until a clinically desirable sedation level was achieved. In 1 group, the BIS was then monitored continually during surgery using a microcomputer (Aspect-1050 Monitor, Aspect Co, Natick, MA) and recorded at 5-minute intervals. The anesthetist (N.A.S.) provided additional propofol boluses to maintain a BIS level of 70 to 80. In the other group, the BIS sensor was applied, but the monitor was not used. In this group, the sedation was modified, and additional propofol was given based solely on the anesthetist's subjective assessment of the desired level of sedation (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation [OAA/S] scale level 2 to 3). Additional boluses of 1 mg of midazolam were given during the procedure if patients required repeated boluses of propofol at less than 5-minute intervals to maintain the desired sedation level (BIS level of 70 to 80 or OAA/S level of 2 to 3). These additional midazolam boluses, as well as the time of the last sedative dose (propofol or midazolam) were recorded to study the effect of these factors on recovery.
Of the 40 patients initially included in the study, 1 subject in the BIS-monitored group was excluded due to the loss of intravenous access at initiation of the case. For the remaining 39 subjects, 19 were assessed objectively using the BIS monitor, whereas 20 were assessed subjectively using the OAA/S scale. The BIS cases were slightly longer in duration than the OAA/S cases, lasting an average of 26 minutes versus 22 minutes. This difference was statistically nonsignificant (P =.19). Less propofol was used in the BIS cases, with an average of 98 mg for BIS cases versus 106 mg for OAA/S cases (P =.59). The total dose in mg/kg/min was significantly less in the BIS group (0.054 mg/kg/min) than in the OAA/S group (0.074 mg/kg/min; P =.0082). There was no significant difference in the amount of midazolam administered after induction between the 2 groups (P =.60). The surgeon, who was blinded to whether the monitor was used, ranked the third molar extractions more difficult in the BIS group (P =.05). However, patients in the BIS group were on average more cooperative, with better maintenance of muscle tone. The difference in these parameters were nonsignificant (P =.15 and .092, respectively). A positive Romberg test was obtained earlier in BIS patients, although this difference was nonsignificant (P =.097). The straight-line test was completed significantly sooner in BIS patients (P =.013). There was no significant difference between the BIS and OAA/S groups in perceptual speed (P =.55) or computation (P =.32). There was essentially no difference between groups in patient-assessed comfort or recall of the procedure. There were also no notable differences in anesthesia complications, return to activities of daily life, or pain medication use between the 2 groups.
