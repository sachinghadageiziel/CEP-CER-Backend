38031451,Association between cumulative duration of deep anesthesia and postoperative acute kidney injury after noncardiac surgeries: a retrospective observational study.,Renal failure,2023,"Huang WK, Lian WY, Zhuo XY, Kang SY, Luo WC, Xie YS, Xi GY, Liu KX, Liu WF","Bispectral index (BIS) is a processed electroencephalography monitoring tool and is widely used in anesthetic depth monitoring. Deep anesthesia exposure may be associated with multiple adverse outcomes. However, the relationship between anesthetic depth and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) remains unclear. We sought to determine the effect of BIS-based deep anesthesia duration on postoperative AKI following noncardiac surgery.
This retrospective study used data from the Vital Signs DataBase, including patients undergoing noncardiac surgeries with BIS monitoring. The BIS values were collected every second during anesthesia. Restricted cubic splines and logistic regression were used to assess the association between the cumulative duration of deep anesthesia and postoperative AKI.
4774 patients were eligible, and 129 (2.7%) experienced postoperative AKI. Restricted cubic splines showed that a cumulative duration of BIS < 45 was nonlinearly associated with postoperative AKI (
The cumulative duration of BIS < 45 was independently and nonlinearly associated with the risk of postoperative AKI in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38031451/

Hypoxia is a particular risk during rebreather diving. Given its subtle symptom profile and its catastrophic consequences there is a need for reliable hypoxia monitoring. Electroencephalography (EEG) is being investigated as a real time monitor for multiple diving problems related to inspired gas, including hypoxia.
A systematic literature search identified articles investigating the relationship between EEG changes and acute cerebral hypoxia in healthy adults. Quality of clinical evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
Eighty-one studies were included for analysis. Only one study investigated divers. Twelve studies described quantitative EEG spectral power differences. Moderate hypoxia tended to result in increased alpha activity. With severe hypoxia, alpha activity decreased whilst delta and theta activities increased. However, since studies that utilised cognitive testing during the hypoxic exposure more frequently reported opposite results it appears cognitive processing might mask hypoxic EEG changes. Other analysis techniques (evoked potentials and electrical equivalents of dipole signals), demonstrated sustained regulation of autonomic responses despite worsening hypoxia. Other studies utilised quantitative EEG analysis techniques, (Bispectral index [BISTM], approximate entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity). No change was reported in BISTM value, whilst an increase in approximate entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity occurred with worsening hypoxia.
Electroencephalographic frequency patterns change in response to acute cerebral hypoxia. There is paucity of literature on the relationship between quantitative EEG analysis techniques and cerebral hypoxia. Because of the conflicting results in EEG power frequency analysis, future research needs to quantitatively define a hypoxia-EEG response curve, and how it is altered by concurrent cognitive task loading.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37718302/
35227197,Effectiveness of the advisory display SmartPilot® view in the assessment of anesthetic depth in low risk gynecological surgery patients: a randomized controlled trial.,BMC anesthesiology,2022,"Strand H, Elshaug AC, Bernersen Ø, Ballangrud R","Assessment of appropriate anesthetic depth is crucial to prevent harm to patients. Unnecessary deep anesthesia can be harmful, potentially causing acute renal failure, myocardial injury, delirium, and an increased mortality rate. Conversely, too light anesthesia combined with muscle relaxants can result in intraoperative patient awareness and lead to serious psychological trauma. This trial aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of the advisory display SmartPilot® View (SPV), as a supplemental measure in the assessment of anesthetic depth in low risk gynecological surgery patients. The hypothesis was that the use of the SPV would increase the precision of assessment, and result in a higher mean arterial pressure.
This trial used a randomized, controlled, single-blind design with a homogeneous sample. Patients undergoing minor, low risk gynecological surgery were randomly assigned to two groups: a test group wherein current standards were supplemented with the advisory display SPV and a control group assessed using only the current standards. Female patients aged between 18 and 75 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System scores of 1-3 undergoing planned general anesthesia using the total intravenous anesthetic method, combining propofol and remifentanil, were included. The exclusion criteria included a body mass index ≥ 35 kg/m
A total of 114 patients were included in the analysis (test group n = 58, control group n = 56). No significant differences in the mean arterial pressure, heart rate, bispectral index, extubation delay, or post-anesthesia care unit stay were found between groups.
The addition of the advisory display SmartPilot® View to current standards in the evaluation of anesthetic depth had no significant effect on the outcome.
The trial was registered on January 16th 2019 with ClinicalTrials.gov (ref: NCT03807271 ).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35227197/
31464960,Effects of dexmedetomidine vs sufentanil during percutaneous tracheostomy for traumatic brain injury patients: A prospective randomized controlled trial.,Medicine,2019,"Gao J, Wei L, Xu G, Ren C, Zhang Z, Liu Y","Percutaneous tracheostomy, almost associated with cough reflex and hemodynamic fluctuations, is a common procedure for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, especially those in neurosurgery intensive care units (NICUs). However, there are currently a lack of effective preventive measures to reduce the risk of secondary brain injury. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) vs sufentanil during percutaneous tracheostomy in TBI patients.
The 196 TBI patients who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy were randomized divided into 3 groups: group D1 (n = 62, DEX infusion at 0.5 μg·kg for 10 minutes, then adjusted to 0.2-0.7 μg·kg·hour), group D2 (n = 68, DEX infusion at 1 μg·kg for 10 minutes, then adjusted to 0.2-0.7 μg·kg·hour), and group S (n = 66, sufentanil infusion 0.3 μg·kg for 10 minutes, then adjusted to 0.2-0.4 μg·kg·hour). The bispectral index (BIS) of all patients was maintained at 50 to 70 during surgery. Anesthesia onset time, hemodynamic variables, total cumulative dose of DEX/sufentanil, total doses of rescue propofol and fentanyl, time to first dose of rescue propofol and fentanyl, number of intraoperative patient movements and cough reflexes, adverse events, and surgeon satisfaction score were recorded.
Anesthesia onset time was significantly lower in group D2 than in both other groups (14.35 ± 3.23 vs 12.42 ± 2.12 vs 13.88 ± 3.51 minutes in groups D1, D2, and S, respectively; P < .001). Both heart rate and mean arterial pressure during percutaneous tracheostomy were more stable in group D2. Total doses of rescue propofol and fentanyl were significantly lower in group D2 than in group D1 (P < .001). The time to first dose of rescue propofol and fentanyl were significantly longer in group D2 than in both other groups (P < .001). The number of patient movements and cough reflexes during percutaneous tracheostomy were lower in group D2 than in both other groups (P < .001). The overall incidences of tachycardia and hypertension (which required higher doses of esmolol and urapidil, respectively) were also lower in group D2 than in both other groups (P < .05). Three patients in group S had respiratory depression compared to X in the D1 group and X in the D2 group. The surgeon satisfaction score was significantly higher in group D2 than in both other groups (P < .05).
During percutaneous tracheostomy, compared with sufentanil, DEX (1 μg·kg for 10 minutes, then adjusted to 0.2-0.7 μg·kg·hour) can provide the desired attenuation of the hemodynamic response without increased adverse events. Consequently, DEX could be used safely and effectively during percutaneous tracheostomy in TBI patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31464960/

Our objective was to compare the limits as well as advantages of routine monitoring tools for the detection of cerebral function and perfusion deficits during cardiopulmonary bypass in a daily clinical setting.
Adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass were included. Patients received monitoring comprising Bispectral Index (BIS), Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and assessment of middle cerebral artery flow velocity (MCAV) using transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography. Measurements were taken after anesthesia induction (at baseline) and every 10 minutes during aortic cross-clamping. Relative deviation from baseline values was calculated. Values were compared with predefined, generally accepted threshold values identifying patients at risk for cerebral functional and perfusion deficits.
30 consecutive patients were included into data analysis. Compared to NIRS as well as BIS monitoring, there was a wide interindividual variability in relative MCAV values for the whole cohort (median 0.9, range 0.39-2.19). Out of 229 measurements in total, 82 BIS but only 30 NIRS and 12 TCD values were lying outside predefined limits. TCD monitoring identified two patients with disturbed cerebral autoregulation, while NIRS remained unremarkable. The latter was significantly associated with systemic hemoglobin levels. Finally, patients with relative MCAV values >1.0 had a higher risk of developing postoperative delirium.
Our findings reveal inherent technical limitations of each individual monitoring component, such as high interindividual variability (TCD), low spatial resolution (NIRS), or interaction with anesthetics (BIS). We therefore argue for a multimodal neuromonitoring that combines several qualities. Such approach would help reducing these limitations while individual components complement each other, thus providing more patient safety during cardiac surgery. Furthermore, such an approach would be easily applicable in a routine clinical setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29485961/

We performed a meta-analysis to determine whether IOH is associated with increased risk of 30-day mortality, major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and acute kidney injury (AKI) after non-cardiac surgery.
We searched PubMed and Embase through May 2016 to identify cohort studies that investigated the association between IOH and risk of 30-day mortality, MACEs, or AKI in adult patients after non-cardiac surgery. Ascertainment of IOH and assessment of outcomes were defined by the individual study. Considering the level of clinical heterogeneity, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model. This meta-analysis is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42016049405).
We included 14 cohort studies that were heterogeneous in terms of definition of IOH. IOH alone was associated with increased risk of 30-day mortality (OR 1.29 [95% CI, 1.19-1.41]), MACEs (OR 1.59 [95% CI, 1.23-2.05]), especially myocardial injury (OR 1.67 [95% CI, 1.31-2.13]), and AKI (OR 1.39 [95% CI, 1.09-1.77]). Triple low (IOH coincident with low bispectral index and low minimum alveolar concentration) also predicts increased risk of 30-day mortality (OR 1.32 [95% CI, 1.03-1.68]).
IOH alone significantly increases the risk of postoperative 30-day mortality, MACEs, especially myocardial injury, and AKI in adult patients after non-cardiac surgery. Triple low also predicts increased risk of 30-day mortality after non-cardiac surgery. These findings provide evidence that IOH should be recognized as an independent risk factor for postoperative adverse outcomes after non-cardiac surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29429638/

However, precise localization of the tracts is sometimes difficult with conventional mapping methods. Thus, the authors developed a novel brain mapping method that enables the 3D recognition of the motor tract for intrinsic brain tumor surgeries. This technique was performed in 40 consecutive patients with gliomas adjacent to motor tracts that have a risk of intraoperative pyramidal tract damage. Motor tracts were electrically stimulated and identified by a handheld brain-mapping probe, the NY Tract Finder (NYTF). Sixteen-gauge plastic tubes were mounted onto the NYTF and inserted in the estimated direction of the motor tract with reference to navigational information. Only the NYTF was removed, leaving the plastic tubes in their places, immediately after muscle motor evoked potentials were recorded at the minimum stimulation current. Motor tracts were electrically identified in all cases. Three-dimensional information on the position of motor tracts was given by plastic tubes that were neurophysiologically placed. Tips of tubes showed the resection limit during tumor removal. Safe tumor resection with an arbitrary safety margin can be performed by adjusting the length of the plastic tubes. The motor tract positioning method enabled the 3D recognition of the motor tract by surgeons and provided for safe resection of tumors. Tumor resections were performed safely before damaging motor tracts, without any postoperative neurological deterioration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29171804/

We experienced severe cerebral infarction caused by paradoxical CO2 embolism during laparoscopic liver resection with injury of the hepatic vessels despite the absence of a right-to-left systemic shunt. CASE REPORT A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in the right hepatic lobe secondary to alcoholic liver disease. We planned the laparoscopy-assisted liver resection. During the surgery, the root of the right hepatic vein was injured. A 1.5-cm hole was accidentally made in the right hepatic vein, while mobilizing the right hepatic lobe laparoscopically. End-tidal CO2 dropped from 39 to 15.5 mmHg, and systemic blood pressure dropped from 121 to 45 mmHg, returning to normal with the administration of inotropes. The transesophageal echocardiography revealed numerous bubbles in the left atrium and ventricle. The Bispectral Index monitoring system showed low brain activity, suggesting cerebral infarction due to paradoxical gas embolism. The hepatectomy was completed by conversion to open laparotomy. The patient went into a coma and suffered quadriplegia after surgery, despite the cooling of his head and the administration of Thiamylal. Brain MRI revealed cerebral infarction in the broad area of the cerebral cortex right side predominantly, with poor blood flow confirmed by the brain perfusion single-photon emission CT. Rehabilitation was gradually achieved with Botox injections. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral infarction by paradoxical gas embolism is a rare complication in laparoscopic surgery, but it is important to be aware of the risk and to be prepared to treat it.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630395/

Proposed advantages over invasive neuromonitoring methods include a lower risk of infection and bleeding, no need for surgical installation, mobility and portability of some devices, and safety. The question, however, is whether noninvasive neuromonitoring is practical and trustworthy enough already. We searched the recent literature and reviewed English-language studies on noninvasive neuromonitoring in subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke between the years 2010 and 2015. We found 88 studies that were eligible for review including the methods transcranial ultrasound, electroencephalography, evoked potentials, near-infrared spectroscopy, bispectral index, and pupillometry. Noninvasive neuromonitoring cannot yet completely replace invasive methods in most situations, but has great potential being complementarily integrated into multimodality monitoring, for guiding management, and for limiting the use of invasive devices and in-hospital transports for imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28004334/

This study included 385 severely burned patients (injured <1 week; TBSA, 31-50% or 11-20%; American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, II-IV) aged 18 to 65 years, who underwent early escharotomy between October 2014 and December 2015, and were selected by cluster sampling. The authors excluded patients with preoperative delirium or diagnosed dementia, depression, or cognitive dysfunction. Preoperative, perioperative, intraoperative, and postoperative information, such as demographic characteristics, vital signs, and health history were collected. The Confusion Assessment Method was used once daily for 5 days after surgery to identify POD. Stepwise binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for POD, t-tests, and χ tests were performed to compare the outcomes of patients with and without the condition. Fifty-six (14.55%) of the patients in the sample were diagnosed with POD. Stepwise binary logistic regression showed that the significant risk factors for POD in severely burned patients undergoing early escharotomy were advanced age (>50 years old), a history of alcohol consumption (>3/week), high American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (III or IV), time between injury and surgery (>2 days), number of previous escharotomies (>2), combined intravenous and inhalation anesthesia, no bispectral index applied, long duration surgery (>180 min), and intraoperative hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 55 mm Hg). On the basis of the different odds ratios, the authors established a weighted model. When the score of a patient's weighted odds ratios is more than 6, the incidence of POD increased significantly (P < .05). When the score of a patient's weighted odds ratios is more than 6, the incidence of POD increased significantly (P < .05). Further, POD was associated with more postoperative complications, including hepatic and renal function impairment and hypernatremia, as well as prolonged hospitalization, increased medical costs, and higher mortality.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27388882/
24795280,Feasibility of bispectral index monitoring to guide early post-resuscitation cardiac arrest triage.,Resuscitation,2014,"Seder DB, Dziodzio J, Smith KA, Hickey P, Bolduc B, Stone P, May T, McCrum B, Fraser GL, Riker RR","Triage after resuscitation from cardiac arrest is hindered by reliable early estimation of brain injury. We evaluated the performance of a triage model based on early bispectral index (BIS) findings and cardiac risk classes.
Retrospective evaluation of serial patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, unable to follow commands, and undergoing hypothermia. Patients were assigned to a cardiac risk group: STEMI, VT/VF shock, VT/VF no shock, or PEA/asystole, and to a neurological dysfunction group, based on the BIS score following first neuromuscular blockade (BISi), and classified as BISi>20, BISi 10-20, or BISi<10. Cause of death was described as neurological or circulatory.
BISi in 171 patients was measured at 267(±177)min after resuscitation and 35(±1.7)°C. BISi<10 suffered 82% neurological-cause and 91% overall mortality, BISi 10-20 35% neurological and 55% overall mortality, and BISi>20 12% neurological and 36% overall mortality. 33 patients presented with STEMI, 15 VT/VF-shock, 41 VT/VF-no shock, and 80 PEA/asystole. Among BISi>20 patients, 75% with STEMI underwent urgent cardiac catheterization (cath) and 94% had good outcome. When BISi>20 with VT/VF and shock, urgent cath was infrequent (33%), and 4 deaths (44%) were uniformly of circulatory etiology. Of 56 VT/VF patients without STEMI, 24 were BISi>20 but did not undergo urgent cath - 5(20.8%) of these had circulatory-etiology death. Circulatory-etiology death also occurred in 26.5% BIS>20 patients with PEA/asystole. When BISi<10, a neurological etiology death dominated independent of cardiac risk group.
Neurocardiac triage based on very early processed EEG (BIS) is feasible, and may identify patients appropriate for individualized post-resuscitation care. This and other triage models warrant further study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24795280/

Accurate methods to predict outcome after CA are lacking.
Seventy-five patients with CA treated with therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac resuscitation were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and neuron-enriched S100 beta (S100β) were measured 48 h after CA. Bispectral index (BIS) was continuously monitored during the first 48 h after CA. The primary endpoint was neurological outcome, as defined by the cerebral performance category (CPC) at 6-month follow-up: scores 1 or 2 indicated good outcome, and scores 3 to 5, poor outcome. The secondary endpoint was survival.
A total of 46 (61%) patients survived at 6 months and 41 (55%) patients had CPC 1 or 2. Levels of NSE and S100β were higher in patients with poor outcomes compared with patients with good outcomes (4-fold and 10-fold, respectively; p < 0.001). BIS was lower in patients with poor outcomes (10-fold; p < 0.001). NSE, S100β, or BIS alone predicted neurological outcome, with areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) above 0.80. Combined determination of S100β and BIS had an incremental predictive value (AUC: 0.95). S100β improved discriminations based on BIS (p = 0.0008), and BIS improved discriminations based on S100β (p < 10(-5)).

We tested the primary hypotheses that major perioperative morbidity is reduced by three potential anti-inflammatory interventions: (i) low-dose dexamethasone, (ii) intensive intraoperative glucose control, and (iii) lighter anaesthesia.
We enrolled patients having major non-cardiac surgery who were ≥40 yr old and had an ASA physical status ≤IV. In a three-way factorial design, patients were randomized to perioperative i.v. dexamethasone (a total of 14 mg tapered over 3 days) vs placebo, intensive vs conventional glucose control 80-110 vs 180-200 mg dl(-1), and lighter vs deeper anaesthesia (bispectral index target of 55 vs 35). The primary outcome was a collapsed composite of 15 major complications and 30 day mortality. Plasma high-sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration was measured before operation and on the first and second postoperative days.
The overall incidence of the primary outcome was about 20%. The trial was stopped after the second interim analysis with 381 patients, at which all three interventions crossed the futility boundary for the primary outcome. No three-way (P=0.70) or two-way (all P>0.52) interactions among the interventions were found. There was a significantly smaller increase in hsCRP in patients given dexamethasone than placebo [maximum 108 (64) vs 155 (69) mg litre(-1), P<0.001], but none of the other two interventions differentially influenced the hsCRP response to surgery.
Among our three interventions, dexamethasone alone reduced inflammation. However, no intervention reduced the risk of major morbidity or 1 yr mortality. TRIAL REGISTRATION IDENTIFIER: NCT00433251 at www.clinicaltrials.gov.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23539236/
22950534,Sedation for critically ill or injured adults in the intensive care unit: a shifting paradigm.,Drugs,2012,"Roberts DJ, Haroon B, Hall RI","As most critically ill or injured patients will require some degree of sedation, the goal of this paper was to comprehensively review the literature associated with use of sedative agents in the intensive care unit (ICU). The first and selected latter portions of this article present a narrative overview of the shifting paradigm in ICU sedation practices, indications for uninterrupted or prolonged ICU sedation, and the pharmacology of sedative agents. In the second portion, we conducted a structured, although not entirely systematic, review of the available evidence associated with use of alternative sedative agents in critically ill or injured adults. Data sources for this review were derived by searching OVID MEDLINE and PubMed from their first available date until May 2012 for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses and economic evaluations. Advances in the technology of mechanical ventilation have permitted clinicians to limit the use of sedation among the critically ill through daily sedative interruptions or other means. These practices have been reported to result in improved mortality, a decreased length of ICU and hospital stay and a lower risk of drug-associated delirium. However, in some cases, prolonged or uninterrupted sedation may still be indicated, such as when patients develop intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury. The pharmacokinetics of sedative agents have clinical importance and may be altered by critical illness or injury, co-morbid conditions and/or drug-drug interactions. Although use of validated sedation scales to monitor depth of sedation is likely to reduce adverse events, they have no utility for patients receiving neuromuscular receptor blocking agents. Depth of sedation monitoring devices such as the Bispectral Index (BIS©) also have limitations. Among existing RCTs, no sedative agent has been reported to improve the risk of mortality among the critically ill or injured. Moreover, although propofol may be associated with a shorter time to tracheal extubation and recovery from sedation than midazolam, the risk of hypertriglyceridaemia and hypotension is higher with propofol. Despite dexmedetomidine being linked with a lower risk of drug-associated delirium than alternative sedative agents, this drug increases risk of bradycardia and hypotension. Among adults with severe traumatic brain injury, there are insufficient data to suggest that any single sedative agent decreases the risk of subsequent poor neurological outcomes or mortality. The lack of examination of confounders, including the type of healthcare system in which the investigation was conducted, is a major limitation of existing pharmacoeconomic analyses, which likely limits generalizability of their results.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22950534/

It may occur during deep anaesthesia, but also in the case of metabolic or haemodynamic brain injury. The goal of the study was to describe the occurrence of SR and to determine factors associated with SR during propofol-remifentanil general anaesthesia maintenance.
We conducted a post hoc analysis of BIS recordings in consecutive patients included in two multi-centre trials, undergoing non-cardiac surgery using a dual closed-loop BIS controller allowing automated propofol-remifentanil administration. The percentage of time spent with a BIS value between 40 and 60 (T(BIS 40-60)) was measured.

19020432,"Presence of electroencephalogram burst suppression in sedated, critically ill patients is associated with increased mortality.",Critical care medicine,2008,"Watson PL, Shintani AK, Tyson R, Pandharipande PP, Pun BT, Ely EW","This study investigates the possibility of a relationship between oversedation and mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. The presence of burst suppression, a pattern of severely decreased brain wave activity on the electroencephalogram, may be unintentionally induced by heavy doses of sedatives. Burst suppression has never been studied as a potential risk factor for death in patients without a known neurologic disorder or injury.
Post hoc analysis of a prospectively observational cohort study.
Medical intensive care units of a tertiary care, university-based medical center.
A total of 125 mechanically ventilated, adult, critically ill patients.
A validated arousal scale (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) was used to measure sedation level, and the bispectral index monitor was used to capture electroencephalogram data. Burst suppression occurred in 49 of 125 patients (39%). For analysis, the patients were divided into those with burst suppression (49 of 125, 39%) and those without burst suppression (76 of 125, 61%). All baseline variables were similar between the two groups, with the overall cohort demonstrating a high severity of illness (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores of 27.4 +/- 8.2) and 98% receiving sedation. Of those with burst suppression, 29 of 49 (59%) died within 6 months compared with 25 of 76 (33%) who did not demonstrate burst suppression. Using time-dependent Cox regression to adjust for clinically important covariates (age, Charlson comorbidity score, baseline dementia, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, coma, and delirium), patients who experienced burst suppression were found to have a statistically significant higher 6-month mortality [Hazard's ratio = 2.04, 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.70, p = 0.02].
The presence of burst suppression, which was unexpectedly high in this medical intensive care unit population, was an independent predictor of increased risk of death at 6 months. This association should be studied prospectively on a larger scale in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19020432/
17897479,Continuous noninvasive monitoring of barbiturate coma in critically ill children using the Bispectral index monitor.,"Critical care (London, England)",2007,"Prins SA, de Hoog M, Blok JH, Tibboel D, Visser GH","Traumatic brain injury and generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) are conditions that require aggressive management. Barbiturates are used to lower intracranial pressure or to stop epileptiform activity, with the aim being to improve neurological outcome. Dosing of barbiturates is usually guided by the extent of induced burst-suppression pattern on the electroencephalogram (EEG). Dosing beyond the point of burst suppression may increase the risk for complications without offering further therapeutic benefit. For this reason, careful monitoring of EEG parameters is mandatory. A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of the bispectral index suppression ratio for monitoring barbiturate coma.
A prospective observational pilot study was performed at a paediatric (surgical) intensive care unit, including all children with barbiturate-induced coma after traumatic brain injury or GCSE. The BIS (Bispectral index) monitor expresses a suppression ratio, which represents the percentage of epochs per minute in which the EEG was suppressed. Suppression ratios from the BIS monitor were compared with suppression ratios of full-channel EEG as assessed by quantitative visual analysis.
Five patients with GCSE and three patients after traumatic brain injury (median age 11.6 years, range 4 months to 15 years) were included. In four patients the correlation between the suppression ratios of the BIS and EEG could be determined; the average correlation was 0.68. In two patients, suppression ratios were either high or low, with no intermediate values. This precluded determination of correlation values, as did the isoelectric EEG in a further two patients. In the latter patients, the mean +/- standard error BIS suppression ratio was 95 +/- 1.6.
Correlations between suppression ratios of the BIS and EEG were found to be only moderate. In particular, asymmetrical EEGs and EEGs with short bursts (less than 1 second) may result in aberrant BIS suppression ratios. The BIS monitor potentially aids monitoring of barbiturate-induced coma because it provides continuous data on EEG suppression between full EEG registrations, but it should be used with caution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17897479/
17121554,Can Bispectral Index aid laryngeal mask placement in children?,Paediatric anaesthesia,2006,"Lim SI, Chambers NA, Somerville NS","Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) placement requires an adequate depth of anesthesia to prevent patient movement and adverse airway responses. Patient movement, coughing, stridor or laryngospasm at LMA placement may result in transient hypoxia, injury to the patient and prolong time spent in the anesthetic room. The Bispectral Index Score (BIS) is a relatively new tool that has not yet established its place in routine clinical pediatric anesthesia practice. One potential use may be to predict an adequate depth of anesthesia for successful intraoperative interventions such as LMA placement in children.
A total of 116 children aged between 1 and 16 years due to have an LMA placed under general anesthesia were enrolled into this prospective, blinded observational study. Complication or success of LMA placement was then analyzed in relation to the BIS value at the time of placement. Other clinical variables were also considered.
The difference in BIS values in children with complicated compared with successful LMA placement was small and BIS therefore appears not to be a reliable predictor for either. Inexperience of the anesthetist and a history of recent upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) may be better indicators for complications.
Bispectral Index Score appears, from this study, not to be a useful tool to help predict complications of LMA placement or to help reduce airway complications during LMA placement. Other markers may be more useful predictors of adverse airway events.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17121554/
16244845,Use of the Patient State Index (PSI) to assist in the diagnosis of perioperative neurological injury and brain death.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2005,"Jacobsohn E, De Wet C, Tymkew H, Hill L, Avidan M, Levy N, Bruemmer-Smith S","We present a series of three postoperative cases that were admitted to a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (ICU) after major surgery. Due to the possible presence of residual postoperative neuromuscular blockade after surgery, a processed electroencephalograph (EEG) was applied prior to starting sedation. This was markedly abnormal in all three cases, and not in keeping with the residual anesthesia. The patients were immediately transported for a CT scan. In all three cases there was severe neurological injury incompatible with survival and end of life decisions were made. Although the utility of quantitative EEG technology, like the Bispectral index (BIS) or Patient State Analyzer (PSA), is becoming better defined in the operating room, the role in the ICU is less clear. We propose that the ICU use of the PSA 4000 may have affected our decision weighing the risk versus benefit of transporting a fresh postoperative case to the radiology suite, expedited the neurological diagnosis, and may have reduced overall ICU resource utilization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16244845/

Our goal is to determine in this population the correlation between the Bispectral Index (BIS) and three commonly used sedation agitation scales: the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), the Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores.
Prospective, single-blinded observational study.
Eight-bed neurology-neurosurgery intensive care unit at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
Thirty critically ill patients admitted to the neurointensive care unit with primary brain injury and a decreased level of consciousness.
Patients were prospectively evaluated for level of consciousness using the RASS, SAS, and GCS every hour and simultaneously were monitored continuously with a BIS monitor for 6 hrs. A Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to correlate the BIS scores with clinical scales. In 15 patients monitored with the newer BIS XP version, the BIS values correlated significantly with the RASS (R2 = .810; p < .0001), SAS (R2 = .725; p < .0001), and GCS (R2 = .655; p < .0001). In 15 patients monitored with the older BIS 2.1.1 software, the correlation was as follows: for RASS, R2 = .30 (p < .008), for SAS: R2 = .376 (p < .001), and for GCS: R2 = .274 (p < .015). This correlation was maintained in patients who received sedative medications.
A statistically significant correlation existed between BIS values and the RASS, SAS, and GCS scores in critically ill brain-injured patients, with and without sedation. The newer BIS XP software package may be a useful adjunctive tool in objective assessment of level of consciousness in brain-injured patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15599143/
12819456,"Continuous nervous system monitoring, EEG, the bispectral index, and neuromuscular transmission.",AACN clinical issues,2003,Arbour R,"In critically ill patients, the central nervous system remains vulnerable to multiple insults including ischemia, hemorrhagic events, and encephalopathy. The peripheral nervous system is vulnerable in the setting of neuro-muscular blockade (NMB), related drug-drug interactions, and drug-clinical state interactions. Optimal assessment of the nervous system is done by means of the clinical neurological examination. In this manner, orientation, arousal, and responsiveness to stimulation provide feedback on focal and global stability of the central nervous system. Where clinical evaluation is compromised, such as with deep sedation and NMB, risk of undetected seizure activity, and/or progression of neurological injury increases dramatically. A patient receiving NMB risks breakthrough awareness and pain. Long-term complications of NMB including prolonged weakness or paralysis as well as post-traumatic stress dramatically increase morbidity and length of stay. Technologies such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and bispectral index (BIS trade mark ) monitoring are effective for assessing cerebral function as well as level of sedation or arousal, respectively, in patients with a compromised neurological assessment. Neuromuscular transmission (NMT) monitoring by means of peripheral nerve stimulation and assessment of the evoked response may be utilized, within the context of clinical assessment, to determine level of chemical paralysis and minimize dosing of NMB agents. This article explores utilization and differentiates technologies such as EEG, BIS, and NMT monitoring. Monitoring parameters are illustrated using a case study approach.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12819456/
