However, the reliability and comparability of these optimal (Opt) parameters across different autoregulatory indices remain uncertain. This paper systematically reviews and synthesizes literature comparing CPPopt, MAPopt, and BISopt derived from invasive and noninvasive indices. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, studies directly comparing CPPopt, MAPopt, or BISopt from at least two indices were included. Ten studies compared CPPopt, mostly in traumatic brain injury, with mean values between 70 and 76 mmHg. Nine studies compared MAPopt, reporting strong correlations between transcranial doppler-, near-infrared spectroscopy-, and intracranial pressure-derived indices across populations, though limits of agreement were wide. One study compared BISopt across indices, showing internal consistency, while two cross-Opt studies found little correlation between BISopt and CPPopt or MAPopt. CPPopt and MAPopt appear physiologically robust across indices, supporting translational potential in both invasive and noninvasive settings. BISopt may represent a distinct optimization domain related to sedation rather than perfusion. Methodological heterogeneity and limited outcome validation remain barriers. Future work should emphasize standardization, multimodal integration, and outcome-driven trials.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41420383/

This series evaluates BL2 acupuncture as a nonpharmacological alternative for persistent hiccups when pharmacotherapy is contraindicated.
Five patients (27-46 years) developed persistent hiccups following laryngeal mask airway insertion, compromising surgical safety.
Persistent intraoperative hiccups refractory to conventional management.
Bilateral BL2 acupuncture using standardized manipulation techniques.
Hiccups ceased within 4-8 minutes (median: 6; interquartile range [IQR]: 4.5-7.0). One recurrence occurred at 30 minutes postoperatively. No adverse events were recorded. Minimal fluctuations in bispectral index (median: 3; IQR: 2.0-4.5) and mean arterial pressure (median: 4; IQR: 3.5-4.5) were observed.

41249938,Comparison of bispectral index and patient state index during general anesthesia with remimazolam.,BMC anesthesiology,2025,"Shiraishi T, Yahagi M, Yoshida M, Yawata M, Kurokawa H, Tamakawa Y, Kawakita Y, Yaguchi Y","Processed electroencephalographic indices, such as the Bispectral Index (BIS) and Patient State Index (PSI), are widely used to assess anesthetic depth; however, their comparative behavior under remimazolam remains unclear. In practice, either index may deviate from its target range despite stable anesthesia, and the response of the companion monitor is uncertain. This study examined whether the two indices moved in parallel or diverged when one departed from its nominal range during remimazolam anesthesia.
In this prospective, single-center study, BIS and PSI were simultaneously recorded at 21 predefined time points from induction to emergence in 60 adults who received remimazolam-based general anesthesia. Remimazolam was induced at 12 mg/kg/h and maintained at 1 mg/kg/h; all patients received neuromuscular blockade (train-of-four ≤ 1). Two trained observers captured synchronized monitor screenshots and documented the Signal Quality Index, electromyography (EMG), and suppression ratio. Analyses used 994 paired observations: pooled Pearson and repeated-measures correlations, simple linear regression (PSI vs. BIS), repeated-measures Bland-Altman analysis, and a linear mixed-effects model for BIS-PSI differences, including anesthetic phase and EMG as fixed effects and patient as a random intercept.
BIS and PSI showed a strong correlation (r = 0.89) and linear relationship (PSI = 0.936 × BIS - 7.26; R² = 0.79). The repeated-measures Bland-Altman bias was + 10.9 (95% CI 10.3-11.4) with 95% limit of agreement (LoA) - 7.8 to 29.5. Phase-wise modeling showed minimal discrepancies while awake and larger differences during intubation and emergence (Tukey-adjusted p < 0.001), even after EMG adjustment. Both indices tracked the anesthetic depth in parallel but were not numerically interchangeable.
During remimazolam anesthesia, BIS and PSI exhibited parallel temporal trends, indicating shared cortical dynamics despite distinct algorithms. When either index deviated, either elevated or suppressed, the other generally moved in the same direction, reflecting consistent responsiveness rather than device artifacts. Phase-dependent discrepancies and wide agreement limits suggest that each index should be interpreted within its reference framework. Understanding this ""parallel yet nonidentical"" behavior may support context-aware, device-specific depth monitoring.

Ciprofol and remimazolam, newly approved agents, cause minimal injection pain and demonstrate stable hemodynamic characteristics. This study aimed to evaluate their effects on arrhythmia inducibility in pediatric supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).
A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of pediatric patients with supraventricular tachycardia who underwent radiofrequency ablation under general anesthesia from May 2020 to June 2024. After excluding 28 cases, 173 patients were deemed eligible for analysis. According to the intravenous anesthesia drugs administered, the patients were classified into the propofol group (Group P), the ciprofol group (Group C), and the remimazolam group (Group R). The primary outcome measure was the arrhythmia inducibility, while the secondary outcome measures encompassed ablation success, extubation time, bispectral index (BIS) value, peri - operative relevant parameters, and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting.
No significant difference was observed in the arrhythmia inducibility among the three groups (97.40% vs 95.35% vs 94.34%) (P>0.05). The secondary outcome measures in the three groups, including ablation success (P > 0.05), isoprenaline use (P > 0.05), recurrence (P > 0.05) and operation time (P > 0.05), were similar. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the incidence rates of nausea and vomiting. Excluding the baseline BIS, the Bispectral Index values of Group R were significantly higher than those of Group P and Group C at the same time point (P<0.05). Moreover, the extubation time in Group R was shorter than that in Group P and Group C.
The effects of ciprofol and remimazolam on arrhythmia inducibility in pediatric supraventricular tachycardia were comparable to those of propofol. Both ciprofol and remimazolam are appropriate for radiofrequency ablation of supraventricular tachycardia in pediatric patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41114284/

The suitable options for moderate sedation medications is necessary. The present study aimed to observation the feasibility and safety of remimazolam in geriatric patients undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
This study is a single-center, randomized, parallel controlled trial conducted on patients undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy at the Hangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, Westlake University. A total of 105 geriatric patients undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy were divided into 3 groups (n=35) randomly. Group A (remimazolam + fentanyl + local anesthesia); Group B (midazolam + fentanyl + local anesthesia); Group C (local anesthesia).The primary outcomes include all patients' vital signs(Heart rate,non-invasive blood pressure,saturation of pulse oximetry,end-tidal carbon dioxide, bispectral index, respiratory rate), Modified Observer's Alertness/Sedatio and the rate of adverse events. Secondary outcomes are onset time of the drug, operation time , recovery time, operator and patient's satisfaction.
This study enrolled a total of 105 patients, among them 97 were actually included in the statistics(34 in group A, 30 in group B, and 33 in group C). Compared with group C, the vital signs in group A and B are more stable at T1, T2, T3, and T4 times(P<0.05), the frequency of hypertension in group A and group B was significantly lower (P<0.05). Compared with group B, the onset time and recovery time of group A were shortened (both P<0.05).

This first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending-dose trial aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of NH600001.
Eighty-eight healthy volunteers were randomized into seven dose cohorts (0.04-0.40 mg/kg). Each cohort included NH600001, placebo, and etomidate as an active comparator. The injectable emulsion was administered as a single, 10 mL intravenous dose over one minute using a syringe pump.

41034765,"Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of Dexmedetomidine two-phase flow atomization in healthy subjects: a randomized, parallel study.",BMC anesthesiology,2025,"Lian Y, Luo H, Yang Z, He J, Chen H, Sun Y","In this study, we aimed to compare the sedative effects, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and safety of dexmedetomidine (DEX) administered using a two-phase flow atomization device with those of conventional intranasal drop-based administration in healthy volunteers.
This prospective, parallel, double-blind study compared the PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of DEX administered via conventional intranasal drop (Group C) or two-phase flow atomization (Group E). Twenty-two healthy adult volunteers were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two groups using a computer-generated randomization sequence. Each participant received DEX at a dose of 2 µg/kg. Sedation was assessed using the Ramsay Sedation Scale and the bispectral index, and PK analysis was performed on blood samples collected at multiple time points.
The two-phase flow atomization group exhibited a significantly faster onset of sedation than the conventional intranasal drop-based administration group and a longer duration of sedation. Compared with Group C, Group E presented an increasing trend in the maximum plasma concentration and in the area under the concentration‒time curve from time zero to the last time point (AUC0t). We found no significant differences in other PK parameters between the two groups, with all P-values > 0.05. The plasma concentrations were slightly higher in the two-phase flow atomization group after 30 min. The changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate of both groups of volunteers were within 25% of the baseline values, with no adverse reactions such as hypotension or sinus bradycardia. CONCLUSIONS : The findings indicate that the two-phase flow atomization device offers faster onset and longer duration of sedation with DEX nasal administration, with a favorable safety profile in healthy volunteers (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Class 1) under specific conditions. Therefore, based on the sedation dynamics, we infer that this device may enhance drug deposition in the olfactory region of the nasal cavity, thereby enhancing the effects of the drug in the central nervous system through nose-to-brain delivery. This study provides new insights into the optimization of nasal drug delivery devices, particularly for pediatric patients and patients in clinical settings requiring rapid sedation.

We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether BIS is advantageous for pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia.
PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BIS-guided anesthesia vs. general anesthesia guided only by clinical parameters in children undergoing surgeries. We computed mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for binary outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using R Software, version 4.2.3.
We included 10 RCTs, comprising 1028 participants, of whom 536 (52%) underwent BIS-guided general anesthesia. Compared with general anesthesia guided solely by clinical parameters, BIS was associated with a lower time for airway device removal (MD -1.32 min; 95% CI -2.26 to -0.37; p < 0.01), recovery time (MD -2.67 min ; 95% CI -3.70 to -1.65; p < 0.01), PACU stay duration (MD -5.51 min; 95% CI -10.64 to -0.38; p = 0.04), and ET sevoflurane concentration (MD -0.49%; 95% CI -0.67 to -0.32; p < 0.01). The BIS guided group also showed a significantly longer time with an adequate BIS compared with the standard care group (MD 22.49%; 95% CI 17.80-27.18; p < 0.01). There were no differences between groups in anesthetic consumption, mean BIS during anesthesia, Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score at 10 min, and at 30 min.
In children, BIS monitoring during general anesthesia limited the exposure to volatile anesthetics and is associated with better recovery outcomes.

This technical note introduces a novel sedation protocol using remimazolam besylate combined with flumazenil in 30 patients with movement disorders undergoing stereotactic functional neurosurgery between November 2022 and March 2024. Remimazolam besylate was administered intravenously for sedation while maintaining spontaneous respiration, with doses adjusted based on patient response and bispectral index values. Sedation was reversed using flumazenil, allowing patients to awaken for neurological assessments; the procedures then continued with patients awake. Fentanyl was used for analgesia, and no muscle relaxants were employed. All patients successfully tolerated the procedures, reporting no intraprocedural discomfort or pain. The mean time to awakening after flumazenil injection was 130.3 ± 73.9 secs. No significant adverse events, including respiratory depression or re-sedation, were observed. One patient experienced a panic attack due to severe claustrophobia, necessitating re-sedation with propofol. The absence of muscle relaxants facilitated effective intraoperative neurological assessments. Postoperative outcomes were positive for all patients. This sedation protocol demonstrated feasibility and safety, offering a promising solution to challenges associated with intraoperative sedation and neurological assessment in stereotactic functional neurosurgery. Further research involving larger cohorts is warranted to confirm these findings and explore broader applications of this technique.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40803842/

Remimazolam besylate, a novel ultrashort-acting benzodiazepine, exhibits minimal accumulation, and its sedative effects can be reversed with flumazenil. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of DE from anaesthesia using remimazolam-flumazenil or propofol in patients undergoing major spine surgery.
This multicentre, randomised controlled trial will be conducted in five hospitals in Hunan Province, China. Approximately 164 patients undergoing major spine surgery lasting >3 hours will be randomly assigned to two groups in a 1:1 ratio. In the remimazolam-flumazenil group, remimazolam will be administered for anaesthesia induction and maintenance, followed by flumazenil for reversal after surgery, whereas propofol will be administered in the propofol group. The primary outcome is the incidence of DE from anaesthesia. The secondary outcomes include the time to obey verbal command, time to bispectral index over 80, time to extubation, length of stay in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU), Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale scores and Modified Aldrete scores on arrival at PACU, at 30 and 60 min, as well as adverse events throughout recovery. All statistical tests will be conducted using SPSS version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A
This randomised controlled trial protocol has received ethical approval from the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University (Approval number: LYEC2024-0357). All participants will be required to provide written informed consent before study enrolment. The findings will be disseminated at academic conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

40778580,"Pre-operative dexmedetomidine nasal spray and emergence agitation in adults undergoing ear, nose and throat surgery: a randomised controlled trial.",Anaesthesia,2025,"Wang D, Dou W, Hu JH, Huang L, Liu H, Ji FH, Peng K","Emergence agitation is common after ear, nose and throat surgery, causing patient discomfort and increased risk of complications. We hypothesised that pre-operative dexmedetomidine nasal spray would reduce the incidence of emergence agitation in adult patients undergoing these procedures.
We conducted a randomised double-blind controlled trial in adults scheduled for ear, nose and throat surgery. Patients were allocated (1:1) to receive nasal spray with dexmedetomidine (75-100 μg based on age and weight) or 0.9% saline, 30 min before induction. Sevoflurane anaesthesia was titrated to bispectral index 40-60. The primary outcome was the incidence of emergence agitation (Riker sedation agitation scale score ≥ 5 from sevoflurane discontinuation to 5 min post-tracheal extubation).
We recruited 159 patients (median (IQR [range]) age 50 (36-60 [18-77]) y; 62% male). The incidence of emergence agitation in patients allocated to the dexmedetomidine group was 25% (20/80) compared with 47% (37/79) in those allocated to the 0.9% saline group (RR 0.53, 95%CI 0.34-0.82, p = 0.004), with a number needed to treat of 4.6. Secondary and exploratory outcomes showed that dexmedetomidine nasal spray was associated with: less venepuncture pain; reduced rate of sleep disturbance on the first night after surgery; and higher patient satisfaction, without increasing adverse events.
Pre-operative dexmedetomidine nasal spray reduced emergence agitation in adult patients undergoing ear, nose and throat surgery, and could enhance peri-operative care for these procedures.
People often feel confused, upset or restless when they wake up after ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery. This can be uncomfortable and cause problems. Doctors thought that give a drug through a nose spray (called dexmedetomidine) before surgery might help stop this from happening. Doctors did a study with adult patients having ENT surgery. Half of the patients got the nose spray with medicine (dexmedetomidine), and the other half got a spray with salty water (normal saline). No one knew who got which spray. The spray was given 30 minutes before the surgery started. All patients were put to sleep using the same type of gas (sevoflurane) and doctors carefully watched their brain activity to make sure they were asleep enough. The main thing doctors looked for was how many people became upset or restless right after waking up. The study included 159 patients. In the group that got the medicine spray, 25% became agitated after waking up. In the group that got the salty water, 47% became agitated. This means the medicine helped a lot: only about 1 in every 5 people needed the spray to see a benefit. The medicine also helped people feel less pain when getting a needle, sleep better the first night after surgery and feel happier overall. It did not cause extra problems or side effects. Giving dexmedetomidine nose spray before surgery helped adults wake up more calmly after ENT surgery. It could be a good way to make the whole surgery experience safer and more comfortable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40778580/
40719578,Does Bispectral Index Monitoring Belong in the Intensive Care Unit Setting?: A Narrative Review of Evidence.,Dimensions of critical care nursing : DCCN,,"Manning J, Chiasson M","Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring was introduced in the 1990s to assess the depth of sedation in operating rooms. It is a valuable tool that requires sensor placement on the patient's forehead, setup of the monitor, and subsequent monitoring by a trained health care professional. In recent years, registered nurses have used BIS monitoring in critical care units to assess patient sedation levels. Compared with its use in the operating room, there is limited research on BIS monitoring in critical care settings. More research is needed to validate the safety and effectiveness of BIS monitoring in critical care units.
Using a narrative review research design, the authors analyzed the current literature investigating the application of BIS monitoring by registered nurses in critical care settings. The study aimed to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on the application of BIS monitoring in critical care units and identify gaps in the current literature.
A narrative review research design was used, yielding 244 articles following the initial keyword search. Two reviewers independently reviewed the relevant titles and abstracts to determine which articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Further analysis yielded 10 articles for further review.
An evidence table was organized, including 10 articles. The source details, findings, and evidence ranking using the Oxford Level of Evidence Scale were described for each article. The evidence synthesis of published research studies revealed 3 themes. First, when used as an adjunct to Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, BIS can reliably identify deep sedation in intubated, sedated, and critically ill patients. Second, current research suggests that the integration of BIS monitoring in critical care settings is associated with decreased medication use and lower costs. Third, BIS monitoring use is linked to a reduction in medical complications such as respiratory depression, aspiration, delirium, and prolonged critical care stays arising from oversedation.
The current literature supports the incorporation of BIS monitoring into the sedation monitoring and assessments of adult critical care patients. Registered nurses can competently use BIS monitoring in the intensive care unit with proper training and education. Key advantages of BIS monitoring include the accurate measurement of patient sedation, reduced sedation medication use, lower health care costs, and a decrease in patient complications related to oversedation. Future studies using experimental designs and systematic reviews are recommended to measure the benefits of BIS monitoring and assess the impact of its use, thereby further supporting its application in critical care units.
The findings suggest that integrating BIS monitoring in critical care units may benefit patient outcomes by improving reliable sedation assessments. Future research using experimental designs is needed to enhance the generalizability of the findings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40719578/

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ciprofol in inducing general anesthesia in patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.
A total of 212 patients scheduled for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were randomly allocated into two groups in a 1:1 ratio: the ciprofol (0.5 mg/kg, n = 106) and propofol (2.5 mg/kg, n = 106) groups. The primary endpoint was to assess the success rate of anesthesia induction. Secondary endpoints included evaluating the time of induction, loss of eyelash reflex, changes in bispectral index, and adverse event incidence.
The success rates of anesthesia induction were 100% in both groups. Ciprofol demonstrated non-inferiority to propofol in induction success. The times to successful induction onset and eyelash reflex disappearance were significantly longer in the ciprofol group compared to those in the propofol group (39.38 ± 8.57 s vs. 36.74 ± 6.82 s, P = 0.014 and 40.36 ± 8.59 s vs. 37.77 ± 6.84 s, P = 0.016, respectively). The adverse events incidence was significantly lower in the ciprofol group compared to that in the propofol group (25.47% vs. 89.62%, P = 0.000). The number of patients requiring top-up doses was not statistically significant (3.77% vs. 7.55%, P = 0.235). Ciprofol demonstrated advantages in hemodynamic stability and maintaining a better sedation level post-induction. Ciprofol was associated with a significantly lower incidence of hypotension compared to propofol (14.15% vs. 37.74%, P < 0.001), and more patients maintained appropriate sedation depth (86.80% vs. 72.64%, P = 0.010, 40 ≤ bispectral index ≤ 60 within 10 min of intravenous administration).
Ciprofol offers a better sedative effect, fewer adverse events, and greater hemodynamic stability during general anesthesia induction in patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

40683805,Response of the Conox quantitative electroencephalographic monitor to neuromuscular block in awake volunteers.,British journal of anaesthesia,2025,"Schuller PJ, Pretorius JPG, Newbery KB","The Conox monitor analyses the frontal EEG to generate two indices of anaesthetic effects: qCON, intended to indicate the level of consciousness, and qNOX, designed to reflect responsiveness to noxious stimuli. Two similar quantitative EEG devices, BIS and Entropy, have been shown to require muscle activity (EMG) to generate accurate index values in awake individuals. Without EMG, these devices produce misleadingly low values and incorrectly suggest sedation or anaesthesia despite the cortical EEG showing the subjects are awake. As EMG affects frequency bands used by Conox, it too could be incorporating muscle activity to generate high values in awake individuals.
We replayed EEGs recorded during awake paralysis to the Conox monitor via an electronic playback system to test whether it requires EMG to generate accurate values in awake subjects.
Both qCON and qNOX decreased after neuromuscular block to values consistent with sedation or anaesthesia, despite subjects being fully awake. qCON decreased below 60 in 15 of 19 trials, and qNOX decreased below 60 in 11 of 19 trials. Overall, 42% of qCON values during paralysis were <60, the level supposedly indicating anaesthesia.
Conox requires muscle activity to generate accurate values in awake individuals. Consequently, it might be an unreliable indicator of awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking drugs. Studies conducted without neuromuscular block can provide misleading guidance when applied to Conox use in paralysed patients. Clinicians should approach manufacturer guidelines with caution and not rely solely on index values to guide dosing of anaesthetic drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40683805/

This retrospective cohort study analyzed clinical data from patients aged ≥60 years who underwent hip fracture surgery between January 2023 and December 2024 at our center. Patients were divided into two groups based on the anesthetic administered: group remimazolam tosilate (RT) (n = 105) and group propofol (P) (n = 115). Anesthetic efficacy outcomes included the time from the start of induction to achieving a bispectral index (BIS) ≤60 and a Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score ≤3, as well as the time from discontinuation of the anesthetic agent to extubation and discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Safety outcomes included assessments of hemodynamic stability and the incidence of adverse events.
Both groups achieved comparable sedation efficacy (BIS ≤60, MOAA/S ≤3). Group RT exhibited significantly shorter extubation times (7.04 ± 1.41 min
RT provides effective anesthesia with faster recovery and enhanced hemodynamic stability compared to propofol in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.

We report a case of hypothyroidism in a patient with treatment-resistant depression detected intraoperatively based on multiple clinical findings. A 49-year-old woman was scheduled for orthognathic surgery for mandibular prognathism. She had depression since the age of 36 and was taking multiple psychotropic medications. After induction, she had persistent hypotension, bradycardia, low bispectral index, and hypothermia that were resistant to treatment. After ruling out common causes and reducing the anesthetic agents, blood tests were performed intraoperatively to examine thyroid function which revealed hypothyroidism. No delayed recovery or postoperative abnormalities were observed. Lithium carbonate was identified as the most likely cause of hypothyroidism by an endocrinologist. Given the overlap in signs and symptoms, hypothyroidism may be overlooked in a patient with depression. The possibility of hypothyroidism should be considered especially noted in patients taking lithium carbonate.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between patient characteristics and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RMZ in older Japanese adults who underwent general anesthesia at the early stage of infusion. Plasma samples were collected from 20 patients (median age: 71.7 years; range: 42.2-88.6 years) who were intravenously administered RMZ without other anesthetics such as remifentanil or fentanyl. The pharmacokinetic profiles of RMZ and its metabolite (CNS7054) were described using three- and two-compartment models with a transit compartment, respectively. The bispectral index was selected as a clinical measure of sedation. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile of RMZ was described using a maximum inhibitory model with an effect compartment. The population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of RMZ were obtained using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling program. RMZ clearance (CL) was increased nonlinearly with increasing body weight (BW), and the population mean CL for a typical patient (BW, 60.4 kg) was 1.38 L/min. No patient characteristics affected CNS7054 pharmacokinetics. The population mean of the half-maximal inhibitory RMZ concentration decreased nonlinearly with increasing age or BW. However, these characteristics did not meet the criteria for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic covariates. Our results suggest that BW is an intrinsic factor affecting RMZ pharmacokinetics in Japanese patients under general anesthesia in the early stages of infusion; however, no patient characteristics affected RMZ pharmacodynamics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40640376/

From June 2016 to August 2024, children who were unable to cooperate with the short-term oral treatment under non-pharmacological behavior or conscious sedation were selected for inclusion in the study. Intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 µg/kg was administered to facilitate preoperative sedation. Furthermore, a topical anesthetic, lidocaine gel, was applied to the venipuncture site. Once adequate sedation was achieved, venipuncture was performed. If preoperative sedation failed, sevoflurane inhalation was used to facilitate venipuncture.

However, they are related to obvious side effects. Patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy are at higher risk of experiencing adverse effects associated with opioids. However, there is great heterogeneity in how to select and combine antinociceptive drugs to replace opioids. This randomized controlled double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the use effect of opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on the quality of postoperative recovery.
This prospective, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized controlled study included seventy-six patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University. Patients were randomly assigned to OFA group or opioid-based anesthesia (OBA) group. The primary outcome included the 15-item recovery quality scale (QOR-15). Secondary measures included intraoperative hemodynamic stability, intraoperative operation information, duration of until postoperative PACU Aldrete score > 9 points, anesthesia-related complication, and number of analgesic pump presses.
The scores of QOR-15 in OFA group were higher than that in OBA group at 24 h and 48 h after surgery. The total dose of propofol required in OFA group was statistically less than that in OBA group. Patients in the OBA group had significantly lower bispectral index (BIS) values and lower levels of MAP at T2 (after intubation) than those in the OFA group patients in the OBA group. Patients in the OFA group showed significantly lower levels of heart rate (HR) at T3 (after abdominal closure) when compared to the OBA group. The changing trend of visual analog scale (VAS) and OBAS scores recorded after surgery were similar between both groups and the VAS and Overall Benefit of Analgesia Scale (OBAS) scores in OBA group were obviously higher than those in OFA group in each time point. The Rhodes Index of Nausea and Vomiting in OBA group were obviously higher than those in OFA group in each time point.
OFA significantly improved postoperative recovery quality as evidenced by higher QOR-15 scores, reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), lower pain scores and decreased opioid requirements compared to OBA. Although duration of awakening from anesthesia was prolonged, OFA demonstrated superior recovery outcomes and fewer complications supporting its clinical utility in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40555931/

General anesthesia is a reversible state characterized by the loss of consciousness and reduced responsiveness. This study hypothesized that polymorphisms in one or more genes encoding the three presynaptic proteins composing the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex affect consciousness and autonomic nerve function during propofol anesthesia.
One hundred thirty preoperative patients volunteered to undergo a simulated anesthesia procedure. The participants were genotyped for candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms using the Sanger method. Changes in verbal commands, eyelash reflexes, and the ability to hold a weighted object during anesthesia induction and recovery were recorded. Further, other anesthesia endpoints such as effector compartment concentrations (Ce), Bispectral Index (BCP-100; Beijing slgo Medical Technology Co., Ltd., China), heart rate variability, and peripheral perfusion index were explored based on the polymorphic site of significant differences in consciousness.
The median and interquartile range results show that the recovery time of verbal commands of the synaptosome-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) rs6039822 G/G genotype (G/G vs . A/A, 319 [259 to 378] vs . 379 [318 to 466] s; P = 0.048) were shorter. Logistic regression analysis showed that SNAP-25 rs6039822 and sex were independent factors influencing the recovery of verbal commands (chi-square = 11.916; P = 0.008). Other consciousness indices, Ce, heart rate variability, and peripheral perfusion index, support the resistance of the SNAP-25 rs6039822 variant to anesthetic during recovery.
Genetic variation in SNAP-25 gene is associated with the recovery of consciousness and autonomic nervous system activity during propofol anesthesia. This finding supports that the presynaptic proteins may be related to the mechanism of action of propofol.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40537066/

40493783,Remimazolam in neuroanesthesia.,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2025,"Abramovich I, Lee CZ, Bilotta F","Remimazolam is a novel ultrashort-acting benzodiazepine that has recently gained attention for its potential benefits in neuroanesthesia. This review aims to critically assess the latest evidence regarding its hemodynamic properties, neurophysiological monitoring compatibility, and recovery profile while highlighting gaps in research and clinical uncertainties.
Several randomized controlled trials and case reports suggest that remimazolam may reduce episodes of hypotension, minimize vasopressor use, and facilitate quicker emergence, especially with flumazenil reversal, when compared with other anesthetics. Nonetheless, the agent's tendency to produce higher bispectral index readings at equivalent sedation levels raises questions about monitoring accuracy. In addition, its long-term safety profile and effectiveness across diverse patient populations remain incompletely understood. The possibility of tolerance development and lack of standardized dosing protocols further underscore the need for more robust, large-scale evaluations.
Although remimazolam has shown promise in providing a favorable hemodynamic profile and rapid recovery in neuroanesthesia, definitive conclusions would require additional high-quality, multicenter trials with standardized methodologies. Clinicians should exercise careful judgment in dosing and monitoring till more comprehensive safety and efficacy data are available, to ensure that remimazolam's potential benefits are cautiously utilized based on evolving evidence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40493783/

Remimazolam is reportedly associated with lesser intraoperative hypotension than propofol. This trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of propofol combined with remimazolam besylate on post-induction hypotension (PIH) in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery.
All enrolled patients were randomly assigned to receive propofol (Group P), remimazolam besylate plus propofol (Group PR), or remimazolam besylate (Group R). Patients in group P received 2.0 mg/kg propofol, Sufentanil 0.4 μg/kg, and rocuronium bromide 0.8 mg/kg; Patients in group PR received remimazolam besylate 0.2 mg/kg, propofol 1.0 mg/kg, Sufentanil 0.4 μg/kg, and rocuronium bromide 0.8 mg/kg; Patients in group R received remimazolam besylate 0.4 mg/kg, Sufentanil 0.4 μg/kg, and rocuronium bromide 0.8 mg/kg; the anesthesia was maintained with propofol 4-10 mg/kg/h and remifentanil 0.1-0.3 μg/kg/min. The primary outcome was the incidence of hypotension after anesthesia induction. Hypotension was defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduced 30% or more from the baseline MAP value or MAP < 65 mmHg. Blood pressure was recorded five times during anesthesia. Time points T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4, were base line, before tracheal intubation, 1 min after tracheal intubation, 5 min after intubation, and immediately after surgical skin incision, respectively. The secondary outcomes were heart rate and bispectral index (BIS). Heart rate and BIS were measured from T0 to T4.
One hundred sixty-nine patients were included in this study. A total of 30 patients in the three groups developed hypotension after anesthesia induction, among which the incidence of PIH induced in group P was 31.6% (18/57), the incidence of PIH induced in group PR was 14.3% (8/56), and the incidence of PIH induced group R 7.1% (4/56), and there was a statistical difference in the incidence of PIH between the three groups (χ2 = 12.24, p = 0.0022). The heart rates in group R (70.53 ± 13.36 bpm, 88.48 ± 13.53 bpm, and 72.68 ± 13.42 bpm) were significantly higher than that in group P (63.68 ± 10.76 bpm, 80.25 ± 12.50 bpm, and 66.35 ± 11.56 bpm) at T1, T2 and T4 (p < 0.05, respectively). The heart rate in group R (88.48 ± 13.53 bpm) was significantly higher than that in group PR (80.00 ± 13.42 bpm) at T2 (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between group PR and group P (p > 0.05). BIS was significantly higher in group R than that in group P and in group PR at T3 and T4 (p < 0.05, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between group PR and group P (p > 0.05).
Both Propofol plus remimazolam besylate and remimazolam besylate alone can reduce PIH, but propofol plus remimazolam besylate smooths the heart rate after general anesthesia undergoing gynecological laparoscopic.

However, it is not known whether there is an advantage of the antagonistic effect of sugammadex sodium over neostigmine at different doses and time points. In this single-center, randomized controlled study, we compared the effects of sugammadex sodium with neostigmine on postoperative myorelaxation recovery in patients undergoing suspension laryngoscopic surgery.
A total of 90 patients scheduled for elective general anesthesia suspension laryngoscopy were selected, aged 18 to 65 years, body mass index 18 to 28 kg/m², and American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II grade. Patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: the sugammadex group (experimental groups, S1, S2), and the neostigmine group (control group, N), each comprising 30 patients. After the operation, group S1 received an intravenous injection of sugammadex sodium 2 mg/kg immediately, S2 received it when train-of-four COUNT (TOF-COUNT) > 2, and group N received intravenous injections of atropine 0.02 mg/kg + neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg when TOF-COUNT > 2. The mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse oxygen saturation, and bispectral index were recorded at various times: upon room entry (T1), during tracheal intubation (T2), at surgery start (T3), surgery end (T4), at extubation (T5), and upon room exit (T6). The duration of surgery, muscle relaxation recovery time from TOF-COUNT 0-2 at surgery end, and time from surgery end to extubation were recorded for each group, as well as the incidence of adverse reactions.
There were no statistically significant differences among the 3 groups in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse oxygen saturation, and bispectral index at the 6 time points (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, and T6). In terms of extubation timing, the S1 group showed a significantly shorter time compared with the S2 and N groups (P < .05). Compared with the S2 group, N group had significantly prolonged extubation times, showing a statistical difference. Compared with the N group, S1 and S2 groups had a significantly reduced incidence of bradycardia and increased secretions (P < .05).
The use of sugammadex sodium in otolaryngological suspension laryngoscopy surgeries offers certain advantages over neostigmine in terms of muscle relaxation recovery. Administering sugammadex sodium 2 mg/kg directly after surgery as compared with waiting until TOF-COUNT > 2 allows for earlier removal of the tracheal tube without increasing adverse reactions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40388779/

However, the optimal sedation for EBUS-TBNA remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adding fentanyl to midazolam.
We conducted a single-center, randomized, double-blind, phase III study. Patients who received midazolam with fentanyl (fentanyl group) were compared with those who received midazolam with placebo (placebo group) during EBUS-TBNA. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients meeting all three criteria: 1) adequate sedation (Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation scale ≤4 or bispectral index values ≤80), 2) minimal additional sedation requirement (no more than two additional sedative administrations within the first 30 min), and 3) successful procedure completion (at least three EBUS-TBNA punctures).

The University Hospital of Lille (France) has developed an expert software system for automatic remifentanil administration based on the continuous monitoring of the Analgesia Nociception Index (MDoloris, France). We assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of the ANI-REMI-LOOP ""expert-system software"" during burn surgery in a monocentric randomized controlled trial.
The trial was approved by the French Ethics Committee, and all patients gave written informed consent. From 2018 to 2022, 52 adults were randomized into two groups: manual remifentanil infusion (standard practice) or automatic remifentanil infusion (expert-system software) during BIS-guided propofol anesthesia at the burn center of the hospital. In the standard practice group, remifentanil administration was based on Minto's model and guided by the analgesia nociception index. In both groups, propofol was administered based on Schnider's model and guided by the BiSpectral Index (Covidien). The primary endpoint was the cumulative remifentanil dose administered during anesthesia and secondary endpoints were related to the clinical safety of automatic remifentanil administration with the incidence and duration of hypotension, bradycardia, hypertension or tachycardia related to nociception. After anesthesia, the endpoints were pain and analgesic requirements during 2 hours. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as median [1st to 3rd quartile].
The cumulative remifentanil dose was significantly lower in the automatic group 0.125 µg.kg-1.min-1 [0.106 to 0.149] vs. 0.152 µg.kg-1.min-1 [0.137 to 0.237], p = 0.004), and the cumulative proportion of time with hemodynamic impairment or reactivity was significantly lower in the expert-system automatic group 4.2% [2.5 to 5.7] vs. 19.4% [6.9 to 59.9], p = 0.010). There were no safety issues, and pain and analgesic requirements were similar in both groups after surgery.

Although clinical studies have shown that remimazolam induction doses decline with advancing age, this property is not reflected in existing models. The purpose of this investigation was to develop a PK-PD model for remimazolam and perform covariate analysis to maximise its utility across broad, diverse populations and to evaluate its consistency with clinical observations of drug dosing.
Arterial and venous concentrations of remimazolam and its metabolite, Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score and bispectral index were determined in 20 studies. Final population models were developed with covariate analysis. Simulations of drug administration for sedation and anaesthesia for this and previously published models were compared with the results of clinical studies.
Model development proceeded from 933 individuals aged 6-93 yr and weight 21-171 kg.

A previous study demonstrated that certain electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns during emergence from general anesthesia are associated with a higher risk for PND. Compared to patients demonstrating the most favorable trajectory ( Traj Ref : delta-dominant slow-wave anesthesia (ddSWA)→spindle-dominant SWA (sdSWA)→non-SWA (nSWA)→wake), patients presenting Traj Abrupt (ddSWA→wake) had 4-fold increased odds to develop PND and patients with Traj High (nSWA→wake) had 8-fold increased odds of developing PND. We hypothesized that commonly used neuromonitoring devices (state entropy [SE], quantium consciousness index [qCON], bispectral index [BIS], and Patient State Index [PSI]) can differentiate between the various trajectories.
From the original database of the study by Hesse et al, we analyzed 59 EEGs from patients emerging from general anesthesia. They were selected according to their trajectory. We included 19 patients who had shown the most favorable trajectory ( Traj Ref ), 20 who had demonstrated Traj Abrupt , and 20 who had followed Traj High . To evaluate the performance of the neuromonitoring devices, we replayed the patients' EEGs to the monitors using an EEG player. We compared the index values for the 3 different trajectories ( TrajRef , TrajAbrupt , and Traj High ) generated by the different monitoring devices, respectively. Additionally, we evaluated the correlation between the monitoring devices.
SE and PSI were able to resolve significant differences between Traj Ref and Traj Abrupt during a major part of emergence. Traj Ref showed an almost linear increase of index values, whereas Traj Abrupt led to an episode of low index values followed by a sudden increase. However, when comparing Traj Ref vs Traj High , qCON, PSI, and BIS were the indices showing significant differences, especially at the beginning of emergence. Patients representing Traj Ref patterns had significantly lower index values than those depicting TrajHigh . Due to the TrajHigh cases starting in nSWA, their indices were already high at the start of emergence.
Our analysis revealed that the course of the different indices reflects spectral EEG patterns during the emergence from general anesthesia. Considering certain emergence trajectories associated with a higher risk of developing PND, our approach might enable the anesthetist to identify patients particularly susceptible to PND by observing the course of index values before admission to the postanesthesia care unit.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40279280/

To optimize intraoperative analgesic titration, several monitoring devices have been developed, each targeting specific physiologic variables. However, existing devices primarily focus on isolated components of the nociceptive response, such as autonomic or cortical activity, without integrating these perspectives comprehensively. Our aim was to compare the performance of different nociception monitors in response to standardized tetanic stimulation and to investigate the correlation between these monitors' responses and varying concentrations of remifentanil.
In this study, we evaluated and compared the responses of the Nociception Level index (NOL), Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI), Pupillary Reflex Dilation (PRD) and both raw and processed electroencephalogram (EEG) under varying concentrations of propofol and remifentanil. Standardized tetanic stimuli were administered to patients under general anesthesia with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. EEG, PRD, NOL, ANI, heart rate (HR), Bispectral index (BIS), and CONOX monitor indices (qCON and qNOX) were concomitantly recorded.
ANI, BIS, HR, NOL, PRD, and qNOX significantly changed after noxious stimulation. In our dataset, PRD had the strongest correlation with varying remifentanil concentrations, while ANI, NOL, and qNOX did not show significant correlations with remifentanil concentrations. Following a noxious stimulus, the raw EEG in patients with low PRD exhibited a significant increase in power in the high EEG frequencies around 25 Hz and decreased power in frequencies corresponding to the alpha range (8-12 Hz) in the power spectral density.
PRD, HR, and BIS correlated with varying levels of remifentanil, with PRD exhibiting the strongest correlation. When CE remifentanil are low, noxious stimuli are more likely to dilate the pupil and be detected in the EEG. Considering the complexity of the nociceptive response, integrating multimodal neurophysiologic monitoring with pharmacological data may improve the anesthesiologist's ability to assess on the nociception-antinociception balance. However, further studies are needed to validate these findings and address the study's limitations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40220354/

This study aimed to characterize the influence of remifentanil on the sedative properties of remimazolam as measured by MOAAS, BIS, and tolerance to laryngoscopy or tetanic stimulation (TOL or TOTS) and to determine target concentrations that maximize MOAAS 2 or 3.
A three-period, crossover, dose-ranging clinical trial was performed in 24 healthy volunteers. In all periods, remimazolam was administered using a step-up and step-down target controlled infusion protocol (50 to 2,000 ng/ml). Stable remifentanil target concentrations of 0.5 ng/ml and 0.1 to 4.0 ng/ml were maintained in periods 2 and 3, respectively. Remifentanil, remimazolam, and CNS7054 (metabolite) concentrations and MOAAS, BIS, TOL, and TOTS were collected in each step of the target controlled infusion protocol. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects models, where P ≤ 0.01 was considered significant.
Remifentanil reduced the apparent clearance of CNS7054 with a half-maximum inhibition at 8.0 ng/ml (95% CI, 5.5 to 13.4 ng/ml). A pharmacodynamic interaction was detected on all endpoints. Simulations indicate that the probability of observing a MOAAS 2 or 3 is highest at remimazolam target concentration of 275, 250, or 200 ng/ml combined with 0, 0.1, or 0.5 ng/ml remifentanil resulting in probabilities of 45%, 45%, and 44%, respectively. Additionally, simulations indicate that the highest probability of observing TOTS and TOL was 93.3% and 85.5%, respectively, at the highest studied target concentrations.
A pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction between remimazolam and remifentanil was quantified in this clinical trial.

Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic parameters, vasopressor use, timing indicators, sedative consumption, BIS values, Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale (R-SAS) scores, urinary tract symptoms, patient satisfaction, and adverse events.
No significant differences were observed in QoR-15 scores between the two groups. Although Group C had higher pain (P = 0.004) and comfort (P = 0.002) scores on POD1, these differences were not clinically significant. The incidence of hypotension and vasopressor use was lower in Group C, which had more stable hemodynamics. Additionally, the time from induction to BIS ≤ 60 was shorter in Group P (P = 0.001), while Group C had lower BIS values from drug discontinuation to full recovery of consciousness (P = 0.001). The incidence of urinary tract symptoms on POD1 was lower in Group C (P = 0.043).

39871139,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofol after continuous infusion in elderly patients.,BMC anesthesiology,2025,"Guo X, Qiao Y, Yin S, Luo F, Yi L, Chen J, Lu M","Ciprofol, a novel intravenous anesthetic, which has primarily been used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in adults, is characterized by rapid onset, short duration of action, and quick and smooth recovery. However, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of continuous infusions and the correlation between the plasma concentration and the bispectral index (BIS) in elderly patients are still unknown.
In this randomized, controlled study, thirty elderly patients (62-78 years old) undergoing elective gastrointestinal tumor resection were treated with propofol (N = 15) or ciprofol (N = 15) as sedatives during anesthesia. After induction, ciprofol/propofol was continuously infused intravenously until the end of the operation. Perioperative vital signs, injection pain, adverse events (AEs), BIS values, eyelid reflex disappearance times, and recovery times were recorded. The plasma concentrations of ciprofol and propofol were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC‒MS/MS) and the pharmacokinetics were determined by noncompartmental analysis.
Both drugs caused a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate after induction. Eight cases (53. 3%) of hypotension and 3 cases (20%) of bradycardia occurred in the propofol group, while 8 cases (53. 3%) of hypotension and 5 cases (33. 3%) of bradycardia occurred in the ciprofol group. At intubation, the ciprofol group experienced fewer fluctuations in blood pressure than the propofol group. Ciprofol resulted in only one case (6.7%) of mild injection pain, less than that produced by propofol (10/15, 66.7%) (P < 0.05). Anesthesia induction was successfully completed with both drugs, and there were no significant differences in eyelash reflex disappearance or recovery time between the two groups. The plasma concentrations during maintenance were relatively stable in both groups (propofol 1.78 ± 0.67 μg/mL, ciprofol 0.71 ± 0.23 μg/mL), and a suitable depth of sedation was achieved with a BIS of 40-60. The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for ciprofol are listed as follows: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) 6.02 ± 2.13 μg/ml; Time to Maximum Concentration (Tmax) 0.18 ± 0.62 min; Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz) 3.96 ± 0.84 L/kg; Total Clearance (CL) 0.83 ± 0.14 L/h/kg; Half-life (t½) 3.47 ± 1.85 h; Area Under the Curve (AUC) 5000 ± 900 L/h/kg; Terminal Elimination Rate Constant (λz) 0.23 ± 0.07 1/h. Similar to propofol, the plasma concentration of ciprofol was linearly correlated with the BIS.
Ciprofol, a novel intravenous anesthetic, can be safely and effectively used in elderly patient continuous infusion with minimal injection pain. Plasma concentrations of ciprofol correlate well with BIS values, helping control sedation depth. For elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumor surgery, an optimal maintenance dose of 0.8 mg/kg/h is recommended.

Pediatric cardiac catheterization, a minimally invasive procedure, is performed to diagnose and to correct many cardiac abnormalities. Deep sedation with spontaneously breathing patients is the preferred technique for pediatric catheterization in the pediatric population. Therefore, the author aimed to find the best combination of drugs for pediatric cardiac catheterization procedures using dexmedetomidine-propofol (DP) and ketamine-propofol (KP).
Cyanotic and acyanotic CHD children, weighing 5-20 kg and undergoing sedation for cardiac catheterization, were randomly assigned into two groups. DP group children received a bolus intravenous (IV) propofol at 1 mg/kg body weight followed by 1 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine over 10 minutes. KP group children received a bolus IV propofol 1 mg/kg followed by ketamine 1 mg/kg over 10 minutes. For maintenance in the DP group, propofol infusion at 1.5 to 2 mg/kg/h and dexmedetomidine at 0.5 mcg/kg/h was started. In the KP group, propofol infusion at 1.5 to 2 mg/kg/h and ketamine at 1 mg/kg/h was started as maintenance. The bispectral index (BIS) was monitored throughout the procedure, and the BIS value was maintained between 60 and 80. Propofol top of 1 mg/kg was administered when the BIS value became more than 80 or when the child moved during the femoral vessel puncture or when the child moved during the procedure.
The mean time for regain of consciousness was faster (P < 0.005) in the KP group (11.02 ± 11.98) compared to the DP group (21.62 ± 18.68). BIS was monitored throughout the procedure; BIS values were lower (P < 0.001) in the DP group (60.0 ± 11.1) as compared to the KP group (73.7 ± 5.6). The cumulative doses of propofol in the KP group and DP group were comparable. Total fentanyl consumptions in the intraoperative period in the KP group and DP group were comparable (P > 0.001). There was no difference in drug side effects between the groups.

All patients underwent a single two-site method of TPVB at the levels of T4 and T7 under ultrasound guidance. The patients were divided into midazolam group (0.25 % ropivacaine + 0.1 mg/kg midazolam) and dexmedetomidine group (0.25 % ropivacaine + 0.8 μg/kg dexmedetomidine) according to the application of sedative drugs, with 78 cases in each group.

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether use of a BIS monitor to guide sevoflurane administration might reduce the average end tidal sevoflurane concentration used in children 4-18 years of age.
Participants in three age groups (4-8, 9-12, and 13-18 years) were randomized to either the BIS guided group or the control group. Use of sevoflurane as the primary maintenance anesthetic was the only requirement in both arms. In the BIS guided group, sevoflurane was titrated to achieve a target BIS value of 45-60 during the maintenance period. In the control arm, clinicians were blinded to the BIS value. Primary outcome was mean end-tidal sevoflurane concentration during maintenance phase of anesthesia. Secondary assessments included time to discharge and the readiness and quality of recovery as assessed by the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale, the modified Aldrete Score, and the Wong-Baker FACES scale. An intention-to-treat analysis was used to analyze and compare groups.
A total of 180 participants were randomized. Following randomization, 10 participants did not undergo any study procedures, leaving 84 participants in the BIS guided group and 86 participants in the control group. Across all age groups, the average end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was less in the BIS guided group compared to control (4-8 years: 2.2% ± 0.3% vs. 2.4% ± 0.4%, -0.3% [-0.4%, -0.1%]; 9-12 years: 1.7% ± 0.5% vs. 2.1% ± 0.6%, -0.4% [-0.7%, -0.1%]; 13-18 years: 1.6% ± 0.4% vs. 1.9% ± 0.5%, -0.3% [-0.5%, -0.1%]). No differences in recovery outcomes between treatment groups were observed.
In pediatric participants, the BIS guided group reported a lower average end-tidal sevoflurane concentration compared to control, though no significant differences in recovery profile were noted.
The Bispectral Index (BIS) is a processed EEG tool that can be used to titrate general anesthesia to achieve desired anesthetic depth. Brain monitoring with BIS resulted in lower average end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations in children aged 4-18 years undergoing general anesthesia.

This study aimed to determine whether the use of remimazolam is non-inferior to etomidate with regard to the occurrence of post-induction hypotension in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.
Patients were randomly assigned to either the remimazolam group (6 mg/kg/h) or the etomidate group (0.3 mg/kg) for induction of anesthesia. Anesthetic depth was adjusted based on the bispectral index. Primary outcome was the incidence of post-induction hypotension, defined as a mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmHg within 15 min after endotracheal intubation, with a non-inferiority margin of 12%.

Incidence of post-induction hypotension was 36/71 (50.7%) in the remimazolam group and 25/73 (34.2%) in the etomidate group, with a rate difference of 16.5% (95% CI [3.0-32.6]) between the two groups that was beyond the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 12.0%. The number of patients who needed vasopressors was similar in the two groups.
In this non-inferiority trial, remimazolam failed to show non-inferiority to etomidate in terms of post-induction hypotension when used as an induction drug for general anesthesia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

However, their reliability in children under 2 years of age remains questionable. During anesthesia maintenance in this age group, processed EEG indices frequently exhibit unexpectedly elevated values that exceed the intended target range.
This study aimed to identify EEG spectral parameters associated with false positive elevations in processed EEG indices and investigate their differences from true positive elevations during emergence.
This prospective observational study included 50 children aged 4-24 months undergoing general anesthesia. Bispectral index (BIS), patient state index (PSi), and raw EEG were continuously recorded throughout anesthesia. False positive was defined as elevated processed EEG indices when end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was maintained at 0.7-1.3 minimum alveolar concentration, with heart rate and mean blood pressure between 80% and 120% of baseline values. We analyzed EEG power spectra and band power values during periods of false positives and compared them with those of true positives during emergence. Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05 was considered significant.
False positives in processed EEG indices were observed in 35 (70%) of the children during anesthesia maintenance, occupying 28% of the maintenance phase. These false positives were associated with decreased power in delta (269-174 dB) and theta (115-97 dB) bands, but widespread increases in alpha and beta bands, resulting in elevated spectral edge frequency (19-22 Hz). Notably, EEG band power during false positives significantly differed from those observed during emergence (delta: 52 dB, theta: 38 dB) (all p < 0.001).

We allocated patients randomly to either the remimazolam/flumazenil group or the sevoflurane group. Patients in the remimazolam group received iv remimazolam whereas patients in the sevoflurane group received sevoflurane for general anesthesia maintenance. Patients in both groups received a remifentanil infusion throughout the TAVI procedure (0.2 μg·kg
Overall, 60 patients were enrolled, and data from 56 were included. The median [interquartile range] time to extubation was significantly shorter in the remimazolam group than in the sevoflurane group (6.5 [5.1-8.1] min vs 14.2 [10.9-15.9] min; difference in medians, -6.9 min; 95% confidence interval, -8.7 to -5.0; P < 0.001). Statistically significant differences were observed in the perfusion index (P = 0.03) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (P = 0.03) between the groups. No significant differences between the two groups were seen in other secondary outcomes.
Compared with sevoflurane, a combination of remimazolam and flumazenil significantly reduced the time to extubation in patients undergoing general anesthesia for TAVI. Therefore, remimazolam may be a suitable choice for general anesthesia in patients undergoing TAVI.

This prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical study enrolled 117 older adults undergoing surgery. Patients in the ciprofol group (group C) received an intravenous injection of ciprofol (0.3 mg/kg, n=57), while the propofol group (group P) received an intravenous injection of propofol (1.5 mg/kg, n=58). The primary outcome was the incidence of hypotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by > 30% from baseline or MAP< 65 mmHg). Secondary outcomes included induction success rate (bispectral index (BIS) value ≤60 and Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAA/S) score ≤1), injection pain, number of drug additions, time to BIS 60, time to eyelash reflex disappearance, blood pressure changes, incidence of hypertension, tachycardia and BIS values before and after administration.
The incidence of induced hypotension was 26.3% (15/57) in group C and 48.3% (28/58) in group P (OR=0.383, 95% CI:175-0.837, P =0.015). Group C had significantly lower injection pain incidence (5.3% vs 20.7%, OR=0.213, 95% CI: 0.057-0.801, p=0.014). Both groups had a 100% induction success rate, with no significant difference in the number of additional doses. Post-intubation hypertension and tachycardia incidence were not significantly different. Group C showed less blood pressure decrease during induction and a deeper anesthesia level.
Compared to propofol, ciprofol reduces the incidence of induced hypotension in older adults and maintains more stable blood pressure during induction. Additionally, ciprofol reduces injection pain and provides a good depth of anesthesia, making it a safe and effective option for anesthesia induction in older adults.

This work focused on exploring whether remimazolam tosilate was effective and safe in anesthesia for short otolaryngology surgery in adults, and optimize its medication regimen, thus providing a theoretical basis for its widespread clinical application.
The present unicentric, double-blind, randomized controlled study enrolled altogether 85 otolaryngology surgery patients aged 18-60 years, and they were divided as remimazolam (RM, 42 cases) or midazolam (MD, 43 cases) group. Efficacy outcomes included successful sedation time, sedation effect (Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score), bispectral index values (BIS), and postoperative recovery. The safety outcomes were patient vital signs at each time point (before induction (T0), 2 min and 5 min after trial drug treatment (T1 and T2 separately), during successful intubation (T3), at the end of surgery (T4), during extubation (T5), and at the time of exiting the room (T6)), any adverse reactions (AEs) during perioperative period, and patient satisfaction with anesthesia experience.
Demographics were not significantly different in both groups (P > 0.05). RM group had significantly decreased successful sedation time relative to MD group (P < 0.05), while increased successful sedation rate (100%) relative to MD group (90.70%, P = 0.116). RM group showed decreased MOAA/S score and BIS value compared with MD group at T1 and T2 (P < 0.05). The spontaneous respiration recovery time and extubation time were not significantly different in both groups (P > 0.05), but RM group exhibited decreased discharge time compared with MD group (P < 0.05). Compared with MD group, the RM group had lower blood pressure (BP) at T3 (P < 0.05); whereas higher heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR) at T1 and T2 (P < 0.05). Difference in AEs was not of statistical significance. Finally, RM group exhibited the increased satisfaction of anesthesia experience compared with MD group (P < 0.05).
Remimazolam tosilate is effective on anesthesia for short otolaryngology surgery. Remimazolam shows the rapid onset, stable circulation, fast postoperative recovery, no increase in perioperative AEs, and high satisfaction with anesthesia experience compared with midazolam.

Therefore, the selection of appropriate anesthetic medication regimen and anesthesia method has an important impact on the intraoperative management and postoperative recovery of patients. This study aims to compare the clinical effects of dexmedetomidine alone in combination with propofol, etomidate and propofol-etomidate mixture in the treatment of radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer.
A total of 90 patients undergoing elective radical gastrectomy were randomly divided into the propofol group (group P), the etomidate group (group E), and the etomidate-propofol mixture group (group PE). Anesthesia induction was performed under the monitoring of bispectral index anesthesia depth. The same pumping drugs were used in 3 groups: 0.1 to 0.3 μg/kg·min remifentanil, 0.5 μg/kg·h dexmedetomidine, and 5 to 10 μg/kg·min rocuronium. The primary outcome indicator was the hemodynamic conditions. The secondary outcome indicators included awakening time and time to accurately answer questions after operation, the prevalence of postoperative respiratory depression and adverse events, the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and preoperative and postoperative Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination scores.
Among the 3 groups of patients, the use rate of vasoactive drugs in group P was higher (P < .05); the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate of group P at T1 to T4 were significantly lower than those of groups E and PE (P < .05); the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate of group E in T2, T4, and T6 were significantly higher than those of groups P and PE (P < .05). The wake-up time after operation and the time to accurately answer the questions were longer in group E than in groups P and PE (P < .05).

However, most previous clinical experience with ciprofol was based on a robust population. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of ciprofol for anesthesia induction in female patients with frailty.
This prospective randomized controlled trial included patients with frailty undergoing elective general anesthesia for gynecological surgery. Frailty was assessed using the modified frailty index. The patients were randomly administered propofol (2 mg/kg) or ciprofol (0.5 mg/kg) during anesthesia induction. The depth of anaesthesia was continually monitored by the bispectral index. The primary outcome was the lowest systolic blood pressure (SBP) during anesthesia induction. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of general anesthesia induction failure and adverse events.
Among the 69 enrolled patients with frailty, 67 were included in the final analysis. The success rate of anesthesia induction was 100% in both groups. The lowest SBP was significantly higher in the ciprofol group than in the propofol group (103 [96-110] vs. 90 [85-98] mmHg, respectively; P < 0.001), suggesting that the former caused less inhibition of hemodynamics during anesthesia induction in patients with frailty. The incidence of injection pain was lower in the ciprofol group than in the propofol group (3 [8.8%] vs. 11 patients [33.3%], respectively; P = 0.014).
The results of this study suggest that the efficacy of ciprofol for inducing general anesthesia in patients with frailty is comparable to that of propofol, with more stable hemodynamics.

It aims to explore the effectiveness of both statistical prediction models and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic prediction model and modern deep learning approaches. Specifically, the study focuses on predicting the bispectral index (BIS), a vital metric in anesthesia used to assess the depth of sedation during surgery, using datasets collected from real-life surgeries. The goal is to evaluate and compare model performance considering both univariate and multivariate schemes. Accurate BIS prediction is essential for avoiding under- or over-sedation, which can lead to adverse outcomes. The study investigates a range of models: The traditional mathematical models include the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model and statistical models such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and vector autoregression (VAR). The deep learning models encompass recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), as well as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) and Transformer models. The analysis focuses on evaluating model performance in predicting the BIS using two distinct datasets of physiological metrics collected from actual surgical procedures. It explores both univariate and multivariate prediction schemes and investigates how different combinations of features and input sequence lengths impact model accuracy. The experimental findings reveal significant performance differences among the models: In univariate prediction scenarios for predicting BIS, the LSTM model demonstrates a 2.88% improvement over the second-best performing model. For multivariate predictions, the LSTM model outperforms others by 6.67% compared to the next best model. Furthermore, the addition of Electromyography (EMG) and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) brings significant accuracy improvement when predicting BIS. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting and building appropriate time-series models to achieve accurate predictions in biomedical applications. This research provides insights to guide future efforts in improving vital sign prediction methodologies for clinical and research purposes. Clinically, with improvements in the prediction of physiological parameters, clinicians can be informed of interventions if an anomaly is detected or predicted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39470955/

To evaluate the Nociception Level Index ability to identify a standardized nociceptive stimulus and the analgesic effect of a fentanyl bolus. Additionally, to characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of fentanyl with the Nociception Level Index response during sevoflurane anesthesia.
Nineteen children, 5.3 (4.1-6.7) years, scheduled for lower abdominal or urological surgery, were studied. After sevoflurane anesthesia and caudal block, a tetanic stimulus (50 Hz, 60 mA, 5 s) was performed in the forearm. Following the administration of fentanyl 2 μg/kg intravenous bolus, three similar consecutive tetanic stimuli were performed at 5-, 15-, and 30-min post-fentanyl administration. Changes in the Nociception Level Index, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and bispectral index were compared in response to the tetanic stimuli. Fentanyl plasma concentrations and the Nociception Level Index data were used to elaborate a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model using a sequential modeling approach in NONMEM®.
After the first tetanic stimulus, both the Nociception Level Index and the heart rate increased compared to baseline (8 ± 7 vs. 19 ± 10; mean difference (CI95) -12(-18--6) and 100 ± 10 vs. 102 ± 10; -2(-4--0.1)) and decrease following fentanyl administration (19 ± 10 vs. 8 ± 8; 12 (5-18) and 102 ± 10 vs. 91 ± 11; 11 (7-16)). In subsequent tetanic stimuli, heart rate remained unchanged, while the Nociception Level Index progressively increased within 15 min to values similar to those before fentanyl. An allometric weight-scaled, 3-compartment model best characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of fentanyl. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling analysis revealed hysteresis between fentanyl plasma concentrations and the Nociception Level Index response, characterized by plasma effect-site equilibration half-time of 1.69 (0.4-2.9) min. The estimated fentanyl C50 was 1.93 (0.73-4.2) ng/mL.

However, the influence of patient positioning changes, particularly in gynecological surgeries where a head-down position is often required, on the accuracy of these monitoring indices remains unexplored.
The aim of the our study was to observe the impact of patient position changes on the monitoring value of entropy and BIS to identify a more sensitive method of anaesthesia depth monitoring for gynaecological surgery patients.
We conducted a study involving 40 women undergoing general anesthesia, during which routine monitoring of vital signs, including electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR), noninvasive arterial blood pressure (NIBP), oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), and end-expiratory carbon dioxide (PetCO2), was initiated. Entropy and BIS devices were affixed to the patients' foreheads after alcohol sterilization to record brain activity. Tracheal intubation was performed following anesthesia induction. Throughout anesthesia maintenance, the value of BIS and response entropy (RE) were monitored and maintained between 40 and 50 by adjusting the infusion rate of propofol and remifentanil with Target Controlled Infusion (TCI, Mintopharmacokinetics model). Dosing for infusion control utilized corrected weight (height-105). Data were recorded before and after position changes, including tilting the operating table to head-down positions of 15 and 25 degrees, returning to a supine position, and elevating the head to 15 and 25-degree angles. BIS and entropy values at different time points were compared between the groups.
Both BIS and entropy values increased from supine to head-down position and decreased from supine to head-up position, with entropy changes preceding those of BIS. Heart rate increased after head-up and decreased after head-down, while mean blood pressure (MBP) exhibited the opposite effect on heart rate. Significant correlations were found between heart rate and BIS (correlation coefficient: -0.43) and RE (correlation coefficient: -0.416), as well as between MBP and BIS (correlation coefficient: 0.346) and RE (correlation coefficient: 0.384).

In this prospective, randomized controlled trial, our aim was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of employing Index of Consciousness (IoC, IoC1 and IoC2) monitoring in predicting and mitigating circulatory stress induced by endotracheal intubation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients under general anesthesia (GA).
We enrolled one hundred and twenty patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy under GA and randomly allocated them to two groups: IoC monitoring guidance (Group T, n = 60) and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring guidance (Group C, n = 60). The primary endpoints included the heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the patients, as well as the rate of change (ROC) at specific time points during the endotracheal intubation period. Secondary outcomes encompassed the systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), cardiac output index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), ROC at specific time points, the incidence of adverse events (AEs), and the induction dosage of remifentanil and propofol during the endotracheal intubation period in both groups.
The mean (SD) HR at 1 min after intubation under IoC monitoring guidance was significantly lower than that under BIS monitoring guidance (76 (16) beats/min vs. 82 (16) beats/min, P = 0.049, respectively). Similarly, the mean (SD) MAP at 1 min after intubation under IoC monitoring guidance was lower than that under BIS monitoring guidance (90 (20) mmHg vs. 98 (19) mmHg, P = 0.031, respectively). At each time point from 1 to 5 min after intubation, the number of cases with HR ROC of less than 10% in Group T was significantly higher than in Group C (P < 0.05). Furthermore, between 1 and 3 min and at 5 min post-intubation, the number of cases with HR ROC between 20 to 30% or 40% in Group T was significantly lower than that in Group C (P < 0.05). At 1 min post-intubation, the number of cases with MAP ROC of less than 10% in Group T was significantly higher than that in Group C (P < 0.05), and the number of cases with MAP ROC between 10 to 20% in Group T was significantly lower than that in Group C (P < 0.01). Patients in Group T exhibited superior hemodynamic stability during the peri-endotracheal intubation period compared to those in Group C. There were no significant differences in the frequencies of AEs between the two groups (P > 0.05).
This promising monitoring technique has the potential to predict the circulatory stress response, thereby reducing the incidence of adverse reactions during the peri-endotracheal intubation period. This technology holds promise for optimizing anesthesia management.

In this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, children aged 2-10 years undergoing elective dental surgery were assigned to one of four groups: placebo, 0.25 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine, 0.5 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine, and 1 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine. Maintenance with fixed-ratio propofol and remifentanil total intravenous anesthesia followed a bispectral index (BIS)-guided algorithm designed to maintain a stable depth of anesthesia. The primary outcomes were time-averaged maintenance infusion rates of propofol and remifentanil. Secondary outcomes in the postanesthetic care unit included sedation scores, pain scores, and time to discharge.
Data from 67 patients were available for analysis. The median [interquartile range] propofol infusion rate was lower in the 1 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine group (180 [164-185] mcg/kg/min) versus placebo (200 [178-220] mcg/kg/min): percent change -10.0%; 95% CI -2.4 to -19.8; p = 0.013. The remifentanil infusion rate was also lower in the 1 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine group (0.089 [0.080, 0.095] mcg/kg/min) versus placebo (0.103 [0.095, 0.106] mcg/kg/min): percent change, -13.7%; 95% CI -5.47 to -21.0; p = .022. However, neither propofol nor remifentanil infusion rates were significantly different in the 0.25 or 0.5 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine groups. In the postanesthesia care unit, there were no differences in pain or sedation scores, and time to discharge was not significantly prolonged in any dexmedetomidine group.
Dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg reduced the propofol and remifentanil requirements during maintenance of anesthesia in children when administered as a postinduction bolus.

A retrospective study analyzed 120 patients scheduled to undergo radical mastectomy in our hospital between January 2022 and December 2023. Depending on the type of anesthesia received, participants were assigned to the experimental group (60 patients) to receive ultrasound-guided intercostal nerve block and intravenous general anesthesia, or the control group (60 patients) to receive intravenous general anesthesia only. Both groups will utilize patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) postoperatively. We will monitor and compare hemodynamic parameters, SpO2, and bispectral index (BIS) at multiple time points, and assess postoperative pain, inflammatory markers, PCIA utilization, and adverse reaction incidence. Comparative analysis showed distinct trends in heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), BIS, and SpO2 across various surgical stages between groups. Notably, MAP values were consistently higher and less variable in the experimental group during surgery (P < .05). Pain assessments at 4, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively in both quiet and coughing states revealed significantly milder pain in the experimental group (P < .05). Preoperative inflammatory markers (PGE2, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1) were similar between groups; however, 24 hours post-surgery, the experimental group showed significantly lower levels of PGE2, IL-6, and MCP-1 (P < .05). Sufentanil consumption during surgery and PCIA use were notably lower in the experimental group (P < .05). The experimental group also experienced fewer anesthesia-related adverse reactions (8.33%) compared to the control group (25.00%) (P < .05). Ultrasound-guided intercostal nerve block significantly improves hemodynamic stability, reduces postoperative inflammatory markers, lowers the need for sufentanil, and minimizes adverse reactions in patients undergoing radical mastectomy for breast cancer.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39093799/

Furthermore, in asleep DBS anesthesia can impair the ability to record single-cell electric activity.The purpose of this study was to describe our surgical and anesthesiologic protocol for MER assessment during asleep subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS and to put our findings in the context of a systematic review of the literature. Sixty-three STN electrodes were implanted in 32 patients under general anesthesia. A frameless technique using O-Arm scanning was adopted in all cases. Total intravenous anesthesia, monitored with bispectral index, was administered using a target controlled infusion of both propofol and remifentanil. A systematic review of the literature with metanalysis on MER in asleep vs awake STN DBS for Parkinson Disease was performed. In our series, MER could be reliably recorded in all cases, impacting profoundly on electrode positioning: the final position was located within 2 mm from the planned target only in 42.9% cases. Depth modification > 2 mm was necessary in 21 cases (33.3%), while in 15 cases (23.8%) a different track was used. At 1-year follow-up we observed a significant reduction in LEDD, UPDRS Part III score off-medications, and UPDRS Part III score on medications, as compared to baseline. The systematic review of the literature yielded 23 papers; adding the cases here reported, overall 1258 asleep DBS cases using MER are described. This technique was safe and effective: metanalysis showed similar, if not better, outcome of asleep vs awake patients operated using MER. MER are a useful and reliable tool during asleep STN DBS, leading to a fine tuning of electrode position in the majority of cases. Collaboration between neurosurgeon, neurophysiologist and neuroanesthesiologist is crucial, since slight modifications of sedation level can impact profoundly on MER reliability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39031226/

A total of 112 patients were recruited for study participation. Among them, the time to BIS ≤ 60 in Group RT was longer than that in Group P (Group RT: 89.3 ± 10.7 s; Group P: 85.9 ± 9.7 s, P > 0.05). While the time to LoC comparing remimazolam and propofol showed no statistical significance (Group RT: 74.4 ± 10.3 s; Group P: 74.7 ± 9.3 s, P > 0.05). The time to extubation in Group RT was significantly longer than that in Group P (Group RT: 16.0 ± 2.6 min; Group P: 8.8 ± 4.3 min, P < 0.001). Remimazolam tosilate had more stable hemodynamics and a lower incidence of hypotension during general anesthesia.
Remimazolam tosilate can be safely and effectively used for general anesthesia in patients undergoing Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy. It maintains stable hemodynamics during induction and maintenance of general anesthesia compared with propofol. Further studies are needed to validate the findings.

Propofol sedation was administered by interventional radiologists in 72 patients (85 procedures, 93 tumors) during RFA for HCC between August 2018 and December 2020. Interventional radiologists equipped with adequate knowledge and skills in sedation and respiratory management were responsible for sedation. Sedation was carefully assessed based on vital signs, including end-tidal carbon dioxide, consciousness status, and bispectral index. The primary endpoint was the incidence of sedation-related complications, which were evaluated separately as respiratory and cardiovascular complications. Secondary endpoints were technical success rate, ablation-related complications, and local tumor control rate. Technical success was defined as completion of ablation in the planned area. Complications were evaluated using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Sedation-related complications, technical success rate, and ablation-related complications were evaluated on a procedure basis, and local tumor control was evaluated on a tumor basis.
Respiratory and cardiovascular complications were observed in eight (8/85, 9.4%) and two (2/85, 2.4%) patients, respectively. Four patients required the jaw thrust maneuver due to glossoptosis, whereas a decrease in oxygen saturation to < 90% was recorded in the other four patients. However, these were temporary, and none required manual ventilation or endotracheal intubation. Bradycardia (< 50 bpm) was detected in two patients; one recovered immediately without treatment, whereas the other rapidly improved after atropine sulfate administration. No severe hypotension (< 80 mmHg) was observed. The technical success rate was 100% (85/85). Grade 3 ablation-related complications were identified in three patients (3/85, 3.5%). The local tumor control rate was 95.7% (89/93).

Can BIS-guided deep sedation (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale [RASS] score, -4 or -5) reduce sedative dosage and increase delirium-free and coma-free (DFCF) days?
A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary mixed ICU, enrolling patients requiring deep sedation for > 8 h. Patients were assigned randomly to either the clinical assessment (CA) or BIS groups (BIS range, 40-60). Both groups used a BIS sensor, whereas the CA group's screen remained covered. After deep sedation, BIS sensors were removed, and delirium was assessed twice daily by researchers masked to the randomization. The primary outcome was the number of DFCF days within 14 days after deep sedation. Additionally, we compared doses of sedative drugs and BIS values during deep sedation.
Ninety-nine patients were included in the study. We found no significant difference in DFCF days (P = .1) between CA and BIS arms, but propofol doses were significantly lower in the BIS group (CA group, 1.77 mg/kg/h [95% CI, 1.60-1.93] vs BIS group, 1.44 mg/kg/h [95% CI, 1.04-1.83]; P = .03).

This prospective clinical study included 69 healthy children (ASA 1) aged 3-7 years. The patients were assigned randomly to propofol group (n = 23), which received propofol; 1:3 ketofol group (n = 23), which received 1:3 ketofol; or 1:4 ketofol group (n = 23), which received 1:4 ketofol. The bispectral index (BIS) and Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) score were recorded at intervals of 5 min to measure the depth of sedation, and vital signs were evaluated. Peri- and postoperative complications and recovery times were recorded. Anxiety levels were also evaluated using the Facial Image Scale (FIS) and changes in saliva cortisol levels (SCLs) before and after the intravenous sedation procedure. The Kruskal‒Wallis test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to determine pre- and posttreatment parameters. Dunn's test for post hoc analysis was used to determine the differences among groups. Children's pre- and posttreatment anxiety levels did not differ significantly according to FIS scores, and increases in SCLs were detected in 1:3 ketofol and 1:4 ketofol groups after dental treatment was completed. Compared with those in the other groups, the BIS values of the patients in 1:4 ketofol indicated a slightly lower depth of sedation.

Four electrophysiological parameters (instant-Analgesia-Nociception-Index (ANI), Bispectral index (BIS), Heart Rate (HR) and Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP)) and one clinical parameter (Behavioural-Pain-Scale (BPS)) were recorded during tracheal-suctioning in all consecutive ICU patients who required a continuous infusion of cisatracurium, before and just after paralysis recovery measured by Train-of-Four ratio. The validity of the five pain-related parameters was assessed by comparing the values recorded during different situations (before/during/after the nociceptive procedure) (discriminant-validity, primary outcome), and the effect of paralysis was assessed by comparing values obtained during and after paralysis (reliability, secondary outcome).
Twenty patients were analyzed. ANI, BIS, and HR significantly changed during the nociceptive procedure in both paralysis and recovery, while BPS changed only post-recovery. ANI and HR were unaffected by paralysis, unlike BIS and BPS (mixed-effect model). ANI exhibited the highest discriminant-validity, with values (min 0/max 100) decreasing from 71 [48-89] at rest to 41 [25-72] during tracheal suctioning in paralyzed patients, and from 71 [53-85] at rest to 40 [31-52] in non-paralyzed patients.
ANI proves the most discriminant parameter for pain detection in both paralyzed and non-paralyzed sedated ICU patients. Its significant and clinically relevant decrease during tracheal suctioning remains unaltered by NMBA use. Pending further studies on analgesia protocols based on ANI, it could be used to assess pain during nociceptive procedures in ICU patients receiving NMBA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38710326/

Patients who required multiple hysteroscopic surgery were randomly assigned to use remimazolam (0.27 mg/kg for induction and 1 mg/kg/h for maintenance) first and then propofol (2.0 mg/kg for induction and 6 mg/kg/h for maintenance) during hysteroscopic surgery again 3 months later, or in the opposite order. Both drugs were used at the latest ED
Seventeen patients completed the study. The lowest BIS value in the remimazolam regimen was significantly higher than that in the propofol regimen (p = 0.001). The MMRM analysis of the BIS values revealed significant differences between the regimens at each time point (p < 0.001). The intraoperative diastolic blood pressure and heart rate changes were smaller, the recovery was faster, and there were fewer adverse reactions and less injection pain, but a greater incidence of intraoperative body movement and hiccups, in the remimazolam regimen.
The trial indicated that remimazolam maintained a higher BIS level than propofol. The correlation between the BIS and the depth of anesthesia induced by remimazolam needs to be further studied.

38454362,Efficacy and safety of ciprofol versus propofol for anesthesia induction in adult patients received elective surgeries: a meta‑analysis.,BMC anesthesiology,2024,"Ainiwaer D, Jiang W","Propofol is use widely used in anesthesia, known for its effectiveness, may lead to cardiopulmonary issues in some patients. Ciprofol has emerged as a possible alternative to propofol because it can achieve comparable effects to propofol while causing fewer adverse events at lower doses. However, no definitive conclusion has been reached yet. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ciprofol versus propofol in adult patients undergoing elective surgeries under general anesthesia.
We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify potentially eligible randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing ciprofol with propofol in general anesthesia until September 30, 2023. The efficacy outcomes encompassed induction success rate, time to onset of successful induction, time to disappearance of eyelash reflex, and overall estimate means in Bispectral Index (BIS). Safety outcomes were assessed through time to full alertness, incidence of hypotension, incidence of arrhythmia, and incidence of injection-site pain. Continuous variables were expressed as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and dichotomous variables were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.4 and STATA 14.0. The quality of the evidence was rated through the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) system.
A total of 712 patients from 6 RCTs were analyzed. Meta-analysis suggested that ciprofol was equivalent to propofol in terms of successful induction rate, time to onset of successful induction, time to disappearance of eyelash reflex, time to full alertness, and incidence of arrhythmia, while ciprofol was better than propofol in overall estimated mean in BIS (MD: -3.79, 95% CI: -4.57 to -3.01, p < 0.001), incidence of hypotension (RR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.94, p = 0.02), and incidence of injection-site pain (RR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.47, p < 0.001). All results were supported by moderate to high evidence.
Ciprofol may be a promising alternative to propofol because it facilitates achieving a satisfactory anesthesia depth and results in fewer hypotension and injection-site pain. However, we still recommend conducting more studies with large-scale studies to validate our findings because only limited data were accumulated in this study.

This has sparked further interest into the exploration and evaluation of methods to achieve an optimal cerebrovascular reactivity measure, where the individual patient is exposed to the lowest insult burden of impaired cerebrovascular reactivity. Recent literature has documented, in neural injury populations, the presence of a potential optimal sedation level in neurocritical care, based on the relationship between cerebrovascular reactivity and quantitative depth of sedation (using bispectral index (BIS)) - termed BISopt. The presence of this measure outside of neural injury patients has yet to be proven.
We explore the relationship between BIS and continuous cerebrovascular reactivity in two cohorts: (A) healthy population undergoing elective spinal surgery under general anesthesia, and (B) healthy volunteer cohort of awake controls.
We demonstrate the presence of BISopt in the general anesthesia population (96% of patients), and its absence in awake controls, providing preliminary validation of its existence outside of neural injury populations. Furthermore, we found BIS to be sufficiently separate from overall systemic blood pressure, this indicates that they impact different pathophysiological phenomena to mediate cerebrovascular reactivity.
Findings here carry implications for the adaptation of the individualized physiologic BISopt concept to non-neural injury populations, both within critical care and the operative theater. However, this work is currently exploratory, and future work is required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436898/
38424486,Application of remimazolam-0.6% sevoflurane anesthesia for flash visual evoked potential monitoring during pituitary adenoma resection: a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial.,BMC anesthesiology,2024,"Shi F, Tang R, Du X, Li X, Wu G","Flash visual evoked potential (FVEP) is a critical method for monitoring intraoperative visual function during neurosurgery. A new benzodiazepine drug called remimazolam has recently been used for general anesthesia. However, the impact of remimazolam on FVEP remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate how remimazolam, in comparison to propofol, when combined with 0.6% sevoflurane anesthesia, affects the FVEP waveform during pituitary adenoma resection.
Overall, 36 patients undergoing pituitary adenoma resection under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to either the remimazolam group (Group R) or the propofol group (Group P) in a prospective, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial. For anesthesia induction, a bolus of 0.2 mg/kg remimazolam or 2 mg/kg propofol was intravenously infused for approximately one minute. The anesthesia was maintained by continuous infusion of either remimazolam (0.7-1.0 mg/kg/h) or propofol (4-6 mg/kg/h), in combination with 0.6% sevoflurane, aimed at sustaining the bispectral index (BIS) within the range of 40-60. The primary outcome was the N75-P100 amplitude of FVEP recorded at approximately 20 min after intubation (T0). 10% of the amplitude at T0 in group P was defined as the non-inferiority margin (δ). Confidence interval testing was used to evaluate the non-inferiority hypothesis. The secondary outcomes covered the P100 latency of FVEP, electroretinogram (ERG) b wave amplitude, demographic characteristics, hemodynamics, and occurrence of adverse events.
The BIS index during anesthesia was comparable between the groups at the same measured time points (P > 0.05). The N75-P100 amplitude at T0 in group R was 7.64 ± 1.36 µV, while it was 6.96 ± 0.95 µV in group P (P = 0.09), with a mean difference of 0.68 µV (95% CI, -0.11 µV to 1.48 µV). The δ was set at 0.7 and the lower limit of the 95% CI exceeded the -δ. Both remimazolam and propofol had little effect on ERG b-wave amplitudes. At the designated time points, FVEP amplitude and P100 latency displayed no appreciable variation between the two groups (P > 0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events related to anesthesia, needle electrodes, or surgery between the two groups (P > 0.05).
Our findings suggest that remimazolam-0.6% sevoflurane is non-inferior to propofol-0.6% sevoflurane for general anesthesia, based on the FVEP N75-P100 amplitude. The electrophysiological data obtained in both groups indicate that reproducible and stable FVEP and ERG waveforms can be acquired at set time points. Therefore, for reliable FVEP monitoring, remimazolam-0.6% sevoflurane appears to be a safe and effective protocol in general anesthesia.

However, this sedation approach comes with a high risk of sedation-related adverse events (SRAEs). Esketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, causes less cardiorespiratory depression than opioids. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of adding a low dose of esketamine to propofol and sufentanil sedation as an opioid-reduced regimen.
A total of 122 consecutive patients with ASA I-II, body mass index < 30, and STOP-BANG score < 3 who underwent cervical conization were enrolled and randomly divided into Group S and Group ES. Using a closed-loop target-controlled infusion (TCI) pump with a target bispectral index (BIS) value of 60 ± 5, patients in Group S were sedated with 0.2 mcg·kg-1 sufentanil and propofol, while patients in Group ES were sedated with 0.15 mg·kg-1 esketamine, 0.1 mcg·kg-1 sufentanil and propofol. The primary outcome was the incidence and severity of SRAEs, while the secondary outcomes included effectiveness of sedation, awakening time, psychotomimetic side effects, postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and patient and gynaecologist satisfaction.
Data from 120 patients were analysed. The incidence of composite SRAEs was significantly higher in Group S than in Group ES (85.0% vs. 56.7%, P < 0.05). Furthermore, the severity of SRAEs was higher in Group S than in Group ES (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of sedation, awakening time, psychotomimetic side effects, postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, or patient and gynaecologist satisfaction between the two groups.
Adding low-dose esketamine to propofol and sufentanil sedation reduces the incidence and severity of SRAEs in patients undergoing cervical conization, with equal sedation efficacy, recovery quality, and no additional psychomimetic side effects.

Among the various physiological processes influenced by opioids, alterations in blood glucose levels induced by opioids are a side effect that is commonly overlooked. The significance of this report lies in emphasizing the neglected association between opioids and hypoglycemia and highlighting the importance of close glucose monitoring to prevent hypoglycemic events in the perioperative setting.
An 89-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus experienced acute severe hypoglycemic episode immediately after general anesthesia induction. Baseline blood glucose level before starting anesthesia induction was 4.0 mmol/L. However, it decreased substantially to 0.96 mmol/L immediately after anesthesia induction.
The patient exhibited normal serum insulin, C-peptide, and cortisol levels, alongside unremarkable renal and hepatic function. After excluding other causes of hypoglycemia, we speculate that opioids were the culprits due to the temporal association and the rapid decline in blood glucose levels.
Forty milliliters of 50% dextrose were administered intravenously followed by an infusion of 5% dextrose.
Recovery from anesthesia, extubation, and postoperative recovery were unremarkable. No further hypoglycemic episodes occurred during hospitalization.
A precipitous and rapid decline in blood glucose following anesthesia induction is extremely uncommon. When a clinical anesthesiologist detects an abnormally low bispectral index during general anesthesia, hypoglycemia should be suspected. Instituting glucose monitoring in these situations can enable a timely diagnosis, forestalling the onset of life-threatening severe hypoglycemia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38134112/

Substance-specific emergence characteristics may additionally limit the reliability of commonly used processed EEG indices during emergence. This study aims to analyze the dynamics of different EEG indices during anesthesia emergence that was maintained with different anesthetic regimens. We used the EEG of 45 patients under general anesthesia from the emergence period. Fifteen patients per group received sevoflurane, isoflurane (+ sufentanil) or propofol (+ remifentanil) anesthesia. One channel EEG and the bispectral index (BIS A-1000) were recorded during the study. We replayed the EEG back to the Conox, Entropy Module, and the BIS Vista to evaluate and compare the index behavior. The volatile anesthetics induced significantly higher EEG frequencies, causing higher indices (AUC > 0.7) over most parts of emergence compared to propofol. The median duration of ""awake"" indices (i.e., > 80) before the return of responsiveness (RoR) was significantly longer for the volatile anesthetics (p < 0.001). The different indices correlated well under volatile anesthesia (rs > 0.6), with SE having the weakest correlation. For propofol, the correlation was lower (rs < 0.6). SE was significantly higher than BIS and, under propofol anesthesia, qCON. Systematic differences of EEG-based indices depend on the drugs and devices used.

We investigated the correlation of the electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters with the effect-site remimazolam concentration and the depth of sedation in patients receiving a target-controlled infusion of remimazolam.
This prospective observational study enrolled 35 patients (32 analyzed) who underwent lower extremity varicose vein surgery or lower extremity orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia. We administered remimazolam by target-controlled infusion using the pharmacokinetic model introduced by Schüttler et al. The EEG data were continuously recorded, including the bispectral index (BIS), patient state index (PSI), spectral edge frequency (SEF), and raw EEG signals. The relative beta ratio (RBR), defined as log (spectral power [30-47 Hz]/spectral power [11-20 Hz]), was obtained by analyzing raw EEG. The level of sedation corresponding to each effect-site remimazolam concentration was assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S). The prediction probability (Pk) and Spearman's correlation coefficients (R) were calculated between effect-site remimazolam concentration, MOAA/S, and EEG parameters.
BIS and PSI showed significantly higher Pk for effect-site remimazolam concentration (Pk = 0.76 [0.72-0.79], P < .001 for BIS; Pk = 0.76 [0.73-0.79], P < .001 for PSI) compared to RBR (Pk = 0.71 [0.68-0.74], P < .001) and SEF (Pk = 0.58 [0.53-0.63], P = .002).

Ciprofol pharmacokinetics (PK) were adequately described by a three-compartment model with first-order elimination from the central compartment and redistribution from the deep and shallow peripheral compartments. An inhibitory sigmoidal Emax model best described the relationship between ciprofol effect-site concentrations and BIS measurements. Body weight, age, sex, blood sampling site, and study type (short-term infusion vs long-term infusion) were identified as statistically significant covariates on the PK of ciprofol. No covariates were found to have a significant effect on the pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters. The PK-PD simulation results showed that the optimal maintenance dose was 0.8 mg/kg/h and the appropriate time to start the maintenance dose was 4-5 mins after the induction dose of ciprofol. Within the exposure range of this study, no meaningful correlations between ciprofol exposures and efficacy or safety endpoints were observed.
A population PK-PD model was successfully developed to describe the ciprofol PK and BIS changes. Efficacy was consistent across the exposure range with a well-tolerated safety profile indicating no maintenance dose adjustment is required for patients undergoing elective surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37976683/

As the use of inhalation anesthesia is associated with a higher incidence of ED, we investigated whether titrating the depth of general anesthesia with BIS monitor can reduce the incidence of ED.
Randomized, prospective, and double-blind.
Patients undergoing endoscopic adenoidectomy under general anesthesia according to a uniform protocol.
A total of 163 patients of both sexes aged 3-8 years were enrolled over 18 months.
Immediately after the induction of general anesthesia, a bispectral index (BIS) electrode was placed on the patient's forehead. In the study group, the depth of general anesthesia was monitored with the aim of achieving BIS values of 40-60. In the control group, the dose of sevoflurane was determined by the anaesthesiologist based on MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) and the end-tidal concentration.
The primary objective was to compare the occurrence of ED during the PACU (post-anesthesia care unit) stay in both arms of the study. The secondary objective was to determine the PAED score at 10 and 30 min in the PACU and the need for rescue treatment of ED.
86 children were randomized in the intervention group and 77 children in the control group. During the entire PACU stay, 23.3% (38/163) of patients developed ED with PAED score >10: 35.1% (27/77) in the control group and 12.8% (11/86) in the intervention group (p = 0.001). Lower PAED scores were also found in the intervention group at 10 (p < 0.001) and 30 (p < 0.001) minutes compared to the control group. The need for rescue treatment did not differ between groups (p = 0.067).

Remimazolam is administered as a bolus dose or continuous infusion, but has not been studied using target-controlled infusion (TCI). The study quantified the relationship between the remimazolam concentration, Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (MOAAS) score, and bispectral index (BIS) using TCI.
The authors performed a three-period, crossover, dose-ranging clinical trial in 24 healthy volunteers using age and sex stratification. Data collected in the first period, where remimazolam was administered alone using a step-up and step-down TCI protocol, were used for this analysis. Remimazolam concentrations, MOAAS scores, and BIS values were collected at each step at steady state. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling methodology.
The relationship between remimazolam, BIS, and MOAAS differed between step-up and step-down infusions at similar remimazolam target concentrations. Tolerance, driven by remimazolam or CNS7054, significantly improved overall model fit (P < 0.01) for both BIS and MOAAS models. After 30 min of repeated bolus dosing, mimicking the regimen in the label for procedural sedation, the BIS and probability of MOAAS 2/3 were predicted to be 54 (95% prediction interval, 44 to 67) and 2% (95% prediction interval, 0 to 32%) versus 58 (95% prediction interval, 48 to 70) and 8% (95% prediction interval, 0 to 36%) in a model without and with tolerance, respectively. After 60 min of continuous infusion, mimicking the regimen in the label for general anesthesia, the BIS and probability of MOAAS 0 were predicted to be 40 (95% prediction interval, 33 to 50) and 87% (95% prediction interval, 18 to 100%) versus 50 (95% prediction interval, 41 to 60) and 59% (95% prediction interval, 6 to 99%) in a model without and with tolerance, respectively.
In this study, it was shown that remimazolam-induced sedation is prone to tolerance development, which is potentially mediated by the CNS7054 concentration. The clinical consequences are, however, limited in situations where remimazolam is titrated to effect.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37889844/

Currently, it is primarily used for gastroenteroscopy sedation.
The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of Remimazolam as an alternative intravenous anesthetic agent in surgical patients, in order to expand clinical options beyond Propofol.
Eighty patients aged 20-69 and classified as an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II were randomly assigned to either the Remimazolam group (RM group) or the Propofol group (PR group) for anesthesia induction and maintenance. Hemodynamics and Bispectral Index (BIS) were recorded before and after anesthesia, along with other relevant indices such as the time, to loss of consciousness (LoC), operation time, anesthesia time, awakening time, the number of cases of injection site pain. Additionally, the Ramsay sedation score, intraoperative awareness, dreaming, and postoperative adverse events were also assessed.
After anesthesia, both groups experienced a significant decrease in blood pressure compared to baseline values, however, the reduction in blood pressure was less significant in the RM group than in the PR group (P<0.05). The heart rate of patients in the RM group remained relatively stable at all time points. There were significantly more cases of injection site pain and use of pressor or atropine during operation observed in the PR group compared to the RM group (P<0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of time to loss of consciousness, anesthesia time, operation time, awakening time, and intraoperative awareness (P>0.05). However, at 5 and 30 minutes after awakening, the Ramsay sedation score was significantly better in the RM group compared to the PR group (P<0.05).
When remimazolam is used for intravenous anesthesia induction and maintenance, it can achieve a favorable anesthetic effect while maintaining a relatively stable blood pressure and heart rate. Patients experience shorter awakening times (8.3±3.7 min), better awakening quality (5 min Ramsay sedation score is 2 points), and no intraoperative awareness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37818571/

The influence of depth of sedation indices such as the bispectral index (BIS) generated by the processed electroencephalogram (pEEG) machine to guide the management of anesthetic depth of sedation on postoperative outcome remains controversial. This research was designed to decide whether an anesthetic agent exposure determined by raw electroencephalogram (rEEG) can influence anesthetic management and cause different EEG patterns and affect various patient outcomes.
A total of 141 participants aged ≥ 60 years undergoing abdominal major surgery were randomized to rEEG-guided anesthesia or routine care group. The rEEG-guided anesthesia group had propofol titrated to keep the rEEG waveform at the C-D sedation depth during surgery, while in the routine care group the anesthetist was masked to the patient's rEEG waveform and guided the anesthetic management only through clinical experience. The primary outcome was the presence of postoperative complications, the secondary outcomes included intraoperative anesthetic management and different EEG patterns.
There were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of postoperative respiratory, circulatory, neurological and gastrointestinal complications. Further EEG analysis revealed that lower frontal alpha power was significantly associated with a higher incidence of POD, and that rEEG-guidance not only reduced the duration of deeper anesthesia in patients with lower frontal alpha power, but also allowed patients with higher frontal alpha power to receive deeper and more appropriate depths of anesthesia than in the routine care group.
In elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, rEEG-guided anesthesia did not reduce the incidence of postoperative respiratory, circulatory, neurological and gastrointestinal complications. rEEG-guided anesthesia management reduced the duration of intraoperative BS in patients and the duration of over-deep sedation in patients with lower frontal alpha waves under anesthesia, and there was a strong association between lower frontal alpha power under anesthesia and the development of POD. rEEG-guided anesthesia may improve the prognosis of patients with vulnerable brains by improving the early identification of frail elderly patients and providing them with a more effective individualized anesthetic managements.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37803259/

In daily clinical practice, the EEG is recorded from the forehead and available neuromonitoring systems translate the EEG information into an index inversely correlating with the anesthetic level. Electrode placement on the forehead can lead to an influence of electromyographic (EMG) activity on the recorded signal in patients without neuromuscular blockade (NMB). A separation of EEG and EMG in the clinical setting is difficult because both signals share an overlapping frequency range. Previous research showed that indices decreased when EMG was absent in awake volunteers with NMB. Here, we investigated to what extent the indices changed, when EEG recorded during surgery with NMB agents was superimposed with EMG.
We recorded EMG from the flexor muscles of the forearm of 18 healthy volunteers with a CONOX monitor during different activity settings, that is, during contraction using a grip strengthener and during active diversion (relaxed arm). Both the forehead and forearm muscles are striated muscles. The recorded EMG was normalized by z -scoring and added to the EEG in different amplification steps. The EEG was recorded during anesthesia with NMB. We replayed these combined EEG and EMG signals to different neuromonitoring systems, that is, bispectral index (BIS), CONOX with qCON and qNOX, and entropy module with state entropy (SE) and response entropy (RE). We used the Friedman test and a Tukey-Kramer post hoc correction for statistical analysis.
The indices of all neuromonitoring systems significantly increased when the EEG was superimposed with the contraction EMG and with high EMG amplitudes, the monitors returned invalid values, representative of artifact contamination. When replaying the EEG being superimposed with ""relaxed"" EMG, the qCON and BIS showed significant increases, but not SE and RE. For SE and RE, we observed an increased number of invalid values.
With our approach, we could show that EMG activity during contraction and resting state can influence the neuromonitoring systems. This knowledge may help to improve EEG-based patient monitoring in the future and help the anesthesiologist to use the neuromonitoring systems with more knowledge regarding their function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37756246/

The primary outcome was the sedative effect of DMT as determined by the bispectral index (BIS) and Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale scores. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred eighteen patients undergoing elective urologic surgery with spinal anesthesia were recruited. Patients were assigned based on their medication status to group N (no medication; n=33), group NS (nonselective alpha-1 blocker; n=27), or group S (selective alpha-1 blocker; n=58). Mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO₂), BIS, and MOAA/S scale scores were recorded at 5-minute (min) intervals after DMT administration. RESULTS Group NS had significantly higher BIS scores than groups N and S at 25 min (P=0.045) and 30 min (P=0.030) after DMT administration, indicating lower sedation levels. MBP significantly differed between the 3 groups at all time points, with group N experiencing a lower MBP than groups NS and S. No significant differences were found between the groups in MOAA/S scale scores, SpO₂, or HR. CONCLUSIONS Nonselective alpha-1 adrenergic blockers can reduce the sedative effects of DMT.

One hundred patients undergoing general anaesthesia using remimazolam.
The BIS was maintained at 60 to 80 during anaesthesia induction with remimazolam. Words were spoken to patients via headphones for 15 min.
The primary outcome was the probability of explicit or implicit memory formation as calculated using the original and extended models, within 24 h after word presentation. Conscious recall memory was assessed using a short-structured interview within 1 and 24 h after surgery. Memory formation was inferred to be absent if 0 was included in the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the probability.
The main results showed no evidence of explicit or implicit memory. The 95% CI of the probability of explicit memory formation included 0 for both models, -0.01 (-0.04 to 0.02) and -0.04 (-0.10 to 0.01), respectively. The 95% CI of the probability of implicit memory formation did not include 0 when evaluated using the original model, 0.08 (0.06 to 0.10), but included 0 when evaluated using the extended model, 0.00 (-0.03 to 0.03). The modified Brice interview revealed no evidence of awareness.
There was no evidence of explicit or implicit memory formation during remimazolam anaesthesia (BIS 60 to 80). Further research is warranted to establish whether explicit and implicit memories are still absent even in the presence of surgical stimulation.

The authors aimed to compare recovery time and unacceptable patient movement during sedation with initial loading of dexmedetomidine followed by continuous propofol infusion with those during sedation with continuous dexmedetomidine and bolus midazolam administration.
In this prospective randomized controlled trial, 54 patients undergoing dental surgery and requiring intravenous sedation were assigned to either the dexmedetomidine and propofol group (n = 27, dexmedetomidine administered at 6 μg/kg/h for 5 minutes, followed by continuous propofol infusion using a target-controlled infusion) or the dexmedetomidine and midazolam group (n = 27, dexmedetomidine administered at 0.2-0.7 μg/kg/h continuously after the same initial loading dose with bolus midazolam). A bispectral index of 70 through 80 was maintained during the procedure. Patient movement that interfered with the procedure and time from the end of sedation to achieving a negative Romberg sign were assessed.
Times from the end of sedation to achieving a negative Romberg sign in the dexmedetomidine and propofol group (median, 14 minutes [interquartile range, 12-15 minutes]) were significantly shorter (P < .001) than in the dexmedetomidine and midazolam group (median, 22 minutes [interquartile range, 17.5-30.5 minutes]). The incidence of unacceptable patient movement was comparable between groups (n = 3 in the dexmedetomidine and propofol group, n = 4 in the dexmedetomidine and midazolam group; P = .999).
Sedation with a single loading dose of dexmedetomidine followed by continuous propofol infusion can prevent delayed recovery without increasing unacceptable patient movement.

This is an ongoing debate since more than 25 years, representing a scientific, cultural as well as geographical divide in the anesthesia community. The Pro side argues that total intravenous anesthesia causes less postoperative nausea and higher patient satisfaction than anesthesia using volatile anesthetics. Target-controlled infusion (TCI) of anesthetic agents allows for better titration of intravenous anesthesia using pharmacokinetic models. Processed EEG monitors, such as bispectral index monitoring, allows for better assessing the effect of TCI anesthesia than solely assessment of clinical parameters, such as ECG or blood pressure. The combination of TCI propofol and objective depth of anesthesia monitoring allows creating a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile for each patient. Finally, anesthesia using volatile anesthetics poses health risks for healthcare professionals and contributes to greenhouse effect. The Con side argues that for procedures accompanied with ischemia and reperfusion injury of an organ or tissue and for patients suffering from a severe inflammation' the use of volatile anesthetics might well have its advantages above propofol. In times of sudden shortage of drugs, volatile anesthetics can overcome the restriction in the operating theater or even on the intensive care unit, which is another advantage. Volatile anesthetics can be used for induction of anesthesia when IV access is impossible, end-tidal measurements of volatile anesthetic concentration allows confirmation that patients receive anesthetics. Taking environmental considerations into account, both propofol and volatile anesthetics bear certain harm to the environment, be it as waste product or as greenhouse gases. The authors therefore suggest to carefully considering advantages and disadvantages for each patient in its according environment. A well-balanced choice based on the available literature is recommended. The authors recommend careful consideration of advantages and disadvantages of each technique when tailoring an anesthetic to meet patient needs.

In a retrospective analysis of electronic anesthesia records from an academic medical center, we examined BIS index changes associated with 14 different intravenous medications, as administered in routine practice, during volatile-based anesthesia using a novel screening approach. Discrete-time windows were identified in which only a single drug bolus was administered, and subsequent changes in the BIS index, concentration of volatile anesthetic, and arterial pressure were analyzed. Our primary outcome was change in BIS index, following drug administration. Adjusted 95% confidence intervals were compared to predetermined thresholds for clinical significance. Secondary sensitivity analyses examined the same outcomes, with available data separated according to differences in baseline volatile anesthetic concentrations, doses of the administered medications, and length of time window.
The study cohort was comprised of data from 20,170 distinct cases, 54.7% of patients were men, with a median age of 55. In the primary analysis, ketamine at a median dose of 20 mg was associated with a median (confidence limits) increase in BIS index of 3.8 (2.5-5.0). Midazolam (median dose 2 mg) was associated with a median decrease in BIS index of 3.0 (1.5-4.5). Neither of these drug administrations occurred during time periods associated with changes in volatile anesthetic concentration. Analysis for dexmedetomidine was confounded by concomitant decreases in volatile anesthetic concentration. No other medication analyzed, including propofol and common opioids, was associated with a significant change in BIS index. Secondary analyses revealed that similar BIS index changes occurred when midazolam and ketamine were administered at different volatile anesthetic concentrations and different doses, and these changes persisted 11 to 20 minutes postadministration.
Modest, but persistent changes in BIS index occurred following doses of ketamine (increase) and midazolam (decrease) during periods of stable volatile anesthetic administration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37582055/

The purpose of this prospective observational study was to assess the feasibility and safety of deep sedation in ERCP to maintain spontaneous breathing.
This is a single-centre observational prospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary referral university hospital. All consecutive patients who needed sedation or general anaesthesia for ERCP were included from January 2021 to June 2021. Deep sedation was achieved and maintained by continuous infusion of an association of propofol and remifentanil. The primary endpoint was to assess the prevalence of major anaesthesia-related complications, such as arrhythmias, hypotension, gas exchange dysfunction, and vomiting (safety endpoint). Secondary endpoints were: (a) to assess the prevalence of signs of an insufficient level of sedation, such as movement, cough, and hiccups (feasibility endpoint): (b) time needed to achieve the target level of sedation and for recovery from anaesthesia. In order to do so we collect the following parameters: peripheral oxygen saturation, fraction of inspired oxygen, noninvasive systemic blood pressure, heart rate, number of breaths per minute, neurological functions with the use of the bispectral index to determine depth of anaesthesia, and partially exhaustive CO
114 patients were enroled. Eight patients were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. We found that all patients were hemodynamically stable: intraoperative mean systolic blood pressure was 139,23 mmHg, mean arterial pressure was on average 106,66 mmHg, mean heart rate was 74,471 bpm. The mean time to achieve the target level of sedation was 63 s, while the mean time for the awakening after having stopped drug infusion was 92 s.
During ERCP, deep sedation and analgesia using the association of propofol and remifentanil and maintaining spontaneous breathing are safe and feasible, allowing for a safe and quick recovery from anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37542218/

We have shown that the potential for improving the pharmacokinetic model is minimal. The drug titration paradox revealed that titration challenges the classical relationship between drug dose and effect in both individuals and the population. We hypothesised that dynamic factors during surgery beyond the static genetic, epigenetic, and other factors such as age, height, and weight affect the necessary dose. We compared the variability of measured end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations with predicted effect-site propofol concentrations when titrated to a BIS range of 40-60, with the hypothesis that the variability in measured sevoflurane concentrations would not be less than the variability in estimated propofol concentrations.
Clinical data from 2280 surgical procedures >1 h in duration were included in the analysis. Anaesthesia with sevoflurane or propofol was based on an institutional protocol. The titration performance for both drugs was assessed by comparing BIS values 30 min after skin incision. The variability of the required concentrations at the same time point was calculated and compared.
The achieved 30-min post-incision BIS ranges were not significantly different for sevoflurane or propofol TCI (30 [99% CI: 28-33] and 31 [99% CI: 27-36], respectively). The variability of sevoflurane concentrations was not significantly different from measured predicted propofol concentrations during BIS-guided anaesthesia (normalized concentration range of 0.89 [99% CI: 0.78-0.99] and 0.93 [99% CI 0.87-1.02).

A prospective, double-blind, randomized trial.
An operating room and a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).
Adult patients (n = 100) having American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of I-III undergoing general anesthesia were enrolled and randomly assigned to the propofol or the remimazolam group.
The propofol group received target-controlled infusion of propofol, and the remimazolam group received continuous infusion of remimazolam. Continuous infusion of remifentanil was used in both groups. For emergence, flumazenil was used in increments of 0.2 mg in the remimazolam group.
The primary outcome was the time required for the patient to obey verbal commands. The secondary outcomes included the time to bispectral index (BIS) over 80, the time to laryngeal mask airway (LMA) removal, the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores in the PACU, and adverse events throughout the study period.
The time taken to obey verbal commands was significantly longer in the propofol group than the remimazolam group (14 [9, 19]) vs. 5 [3, 7]) minutes, P < 0.001; median difference -9, 95% confidence interval -11 to -6). The times to BIS over 80 and to LMA removal were also significantly longer in the propofol group.

Re-sedation in the PACU was observed in 11 (22%) of the patients in the remimazolam group.
Remimazolam-based total intravenous anesthesia with flumazenil reversal may be effective in reducing emergence time, but a significant incidence of re-sedation was observed in the PACU.

Fifteen inpatients who underwent elective ERCP in our hospital were prospectively enrolled, and a series of case studies were conducted with the prone extubation technique after general anesthesia. All patients underwent routine operation of tracheal intubation under general anesthesia. After the surgery, when the train-of-four ratio (TOFr) ≥0.9, bispectral index (BIS) ≥80, tidal volume ≥6 ml/kg and the required actions could be performed, the endotracheal catheter was removed after sufficient negative pressure suction of oral secretions. After the endotracheal catheter was removed, the patient autonomously turned to the transport bed with the assistance of medical staff and was then admitted to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for further observation. When the patient awoke, he had regained orientation, and presented stable vital signs, no nausea and vomiting, and no other discomfort symptoms, he/she was able to leave PACU and returned to the ward with a Steward score of ≥5.

Variational mode decomposition (VMD) searches for IMFs by optimizing the bandwidth to a narrow band with the [Formula: see text] norm while preserving the online estimated central frequency. In this study, we applied VMD to the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during general anesthesia. Using a bispectral index monitor, EEGs were recorded from 10 adult surgical patients (the median age: 47.0, and the percentile range: 27.0-59.3 years) who were anesthetized with sevoflurane. We created an application named EEG Mode Decompositor, which decomposes the recorded EEG into IMFs and displays the Hilbert spectrogram.

Automated administration of propofol total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), which facilitates precision propofol delivery by factoring in continuous patient input variable (bispectral index) to establish a closed feedback loop system, may help mitigate concerns related to propofol's lipid solubility and adverse accumulation kinetics in patients with morbid obesity. This randomized study evaluated the recovery of patients with morbid obesity undergoing bariatric surgery under propofol TIVA automated by a closed-loop anesthesia delivery system (CLADS) versus desflurane GA.
Forty patients, randomly allocated to receive propofol TIVA (CLADS group) or desflurane GA (desflurane group), were evaluated for postoperative recovery (early and intermediate) (primary objective); they were evaluated for intraoperative hemodynamics, anesthesia depth consistency, anesthesia delivery performance characteristics, patient satisfaction, and incidence of adverse events (sedation, pain, postoperative nausea, and vomiting) (secondary objective).

Remimazolam is reportedly associated with lesser intraoperative hypotension than propofol. This study compared the overall incidence of PIH following remimazolam or propofol administration in patients managed by angiotensin axis blockades.
This single-blind, parallel-group, randomized control trial was conducted in a tertiary university hospital in South Korea. Patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia were considered for enrollment if the inclusion criteria were met: administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, 19 to 65 years old, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification ≤ III, and no involvement in other clinical trials. The primary outcome was the overall incidence of PIH, defined as a mean blood pressure (MBP) < 65 mmHg or decrease by ≥ 30% of the baseline MBP. The time points of measurement were baseline, just before the initial intubation attempt, and 1, 5, 10, and 15 min following intubation. The heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and bispectral index were also recorded. Groups P and R included patients administered propofol and remimazolam, respectively, as an induction agent.
A total of 81 patients were analyzed, of the 82 randomized patients. PIH was less frequent in group R than group P (62.5% versus 82.9%; t value 4.27, P = 0.04, adjusted odds ratio = 0.32 [95% confidence interval 0.10-0.99]). The decrease in the MBP from baseline was 9.6 mmHg lesser in group R than in group P before the initial intubation attempt (95% confidence interval 3.3-15.9). A similar trend was observed for systolic and diastolic blood pressures. No severe adverse events were observed in either group.

The efficacy of TINBs may also be different between nonintubated VATS (NIVATS) and intubated VATS (IVATS). We aim to compare the efficacy of TINBs on analgesia and sedation for NIVATS and IVATs intraoperatively.
Sixty patients randomized to the NIVATS or IVATS group (30 each) received target-controlled propofol and remifentanil infusions, with bispectral index (BIS) maintained at 40-60, and multilevel (T3-T8) TINBs before surgical manipulations. Intraoperative monitoring data, including pulse oximetry, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, BIS, density spectral arrays (DSAs), and propofol and remifentanil effect-site concentration (Ce) at different time points. A two way ANOVA with post hoc analysis was applied to analyze the differences and interactions of groups and time points.
In both groups, DSA monitoring revealed burst suppression and α dropout immediately after the TINBs. The Ce of the propofol infusion had to be reduced within 5 min post-TINBs in both NIVATS (p < 0.001) and IVATS (p = 0.252) groups. The Ce of remifentanil infusion was significantly reduced after TINBs in both groups (p < 0.001), and was significantly lower in NIVATS (p < 0.001) without group interactions.
The surgeon-performed intraoperative multilevel TINBs allow reduced anesthetic and analgesic requirement for VATS. With lower requirement of remifentanil infusion, NIVATS presents a significantly higher risk of hypotension after TINBs. DSA is beneficial for providing real-time data that facilitate the preemptive management, especially for NIVATS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37330304/
37322424,Comparison of bispectral index and patient state index as measures of sedation depth during surgeries using remimazolam tosilate.,BMC anesthesiology,2023,"Zhao TY, Chen D, Xu ZX, Wang HL, Sun H","The Bispectral Index (BIS) and the Patient State Index (PSI) are commonly used measures to assess intraoperative sedation depth. However, model differences lead to different results, which in turn interferes with clinicians' judgment on the depth of anesthesia. Remimazolam tosilate (RT) for injection is a new benzodiazepine used in sedation. In its clinical application, there are few effective indicators for sedation depth monitoring. To close this gap, this study aims to compare BIS and PSI in measuring the sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative RT and to explore the safety of RT for intraspinal anesthesia in elderly patients.
This study included 40 patients undergoing elective electro-prostatectomy with intraspinal anesthesia, who were monitored by BIS and PSI simultaneously during operation. Remimazolam tosylate 0.1 mg/kg was intravenously administered after the intraspinal anesthesia when patients were in a completely painless status. Then BIS, PSI, the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (MOAA/S) scores and vital signs were observed and recorded per minute for 10 min. Pearson's correlation analysis and linear regression model were used to compare BIS and PSI sedation scores, and to test their associations with the MOAA/S score, respectively. ROC curves were drawn to compare the sensitivity and specificity of BIS and PSI. Changes of vital signs were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Perioperative liver and kidney function indicators were analyzed using a paired t-test to evaluate the safety of RT for intraspinal anesthesia in the elderly patients.
According to Pearson's correlation analysis, a significant (P < 0.01) correlation between BIS and PSI was found when used to monitor intraoperative sedation of RT (r = 0.796). Significant associations between BIS and MOAA/S (r = 0.568, P < 0.01), and between PSI and MOAA/S (r = 0.390, P < 0.01) were also found. The areas under the ROC curves of BIS and PSI were 0.801 ± 0.022 and 0.734 ± 0.026, respectively, suggesting that both measures may predict patients' state of consciousness and BIS was more accurate than PSI. Vital signs remained stable throughout the study. No abnormal changes of clinical significance were found based on laboratory test results of liver and kidney function.
BIS and PSI are strongly associated for monitoring the sedation of RT intraoperatively. Both methods can accurately reflect sedation depth. According to correlation analyses with MOAA/S scale and ROC curves, BIS is more accurate than PSI during such intraoperative monitoring. In addition, RT can be safely used in elderly patients under intraspinal anesthesia for supportive sedation, with stable vital signs and sound kidney and liver safety profiles.

To date, there have been relatively few articles comparing RT and propofol for general anesthesia. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of RT with or without flumazenil compared with propofol in general anesthesia for day surgery.
115 patients scheduled for day surgery were randomized into three groups: RT (n = 39), RT + flumazenil (n = 38) and propofol (n = 38). The primary endpoints were anesthesia induction time and time until fully alert. Anesthesia success rate, bispectral index (BIS) values, injection pain, opioid and vasopressor dosages, postoperative recovery profiles and perioperative inflammatory and cognitive changes were assessed. Any adverse events were recorded.
Induction times were similar among the three groups (P = 0.437), but the median time until fully alert in patients treated with RT was longer than that of the propofol or RT + flumazenil groups (17.6 min vs. 12.3 min vs. 12.3 min, P < 0.001). The three groups had comparable postoperative recovery quality and inflammatory and cognitive state changes (P > 0.05). Smaller percentages of patients who received RT (26.3%) and RT + flumazenil (31.6%) developed hypotension during anesthesia maintenance compared with propofol (68.4%), and consequently less ephedrine (P < 0.001) and phenylephrine (P = 0.015) were needed in the RT group. Furthermore, serum triglyceride levels were lower (P < 0.001) and injection pain was much less frequent in the RT with or without flumazenil groups compared with the propofol group (5.3% vs. 0% vs. 18.4%).
RT permits rapid induction and comparable recovery profile compared with propofol in general anesthesia for day surgery, but has a prolonged recovery time without flumazenil. The safety profile of RT was superior to propofol in terms of hypotension and injection pain.

In this prospective clinical study, a total of 124 patients undergoing anaesthesia with propofol, as a single drug, were evaluated when undergoing colonoscopy procedure. Clinical variables were obtained from the patient's anamnesis prior to performing the anaesthetic procedure, in the moment of the patient's loss of consciousness, during the colonoscopy exam (recorded every 5 min) and in the awakening time.
Polymorphic genotypes for the rs3745274 and rs1057910 polymorphisms were associated with bispectral index, target-controlled infusion (TCI)/effector concentration of propofol and TCI/plasma concentration of propofol values. Based on multivariate analysis, it was observed that weight, age, surgery time, systolic blood pressure and the rs1057910 polymorphism corresponded to predictive values for the dose of propofol used. Weight (B = 4.807±0.897), age (B = 1.834±0.834) and duration of surgery (B = 8.164±1.624) corresponded to factors associated with increased propofol dose, while systolic blood pressure (B = -1.892±0.679) and the genotypes (AA vs CA) of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1057910 CYPP2C9 gene (B = -74.161±26.820) decreased the total dose of propofol used.
We concluded that the rs1057910 and rs3745274 polymorphisms affect the metabolism of propofol in patients exclusively submitted to this drug. Thus, the knowledge of the polymorphic genotypes of the CYPP2C9 and CYB2B6 genes may be predictive of different metabolising phenotypes, suggesting expected behaviours of BIS parameter in the anaesthetic procedure, which contributes to safer monitoring by anaesthesiologists during the clinical intervention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37227973/

The development of electroencephalography analysis could provide indicators for early detection, intervention, and evaluation. If there are pathophysiological changes in the brain, the BIS value will also change accordingly. In this study, we investigated the predictive value of the preoperative bispectral (BIS) index in POD for patients aged over 75 years.
In this prospective study, patients (≥ 75 years) undergoing elective non-neurosurgery and non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia were included (n = 308). Informed consent was obtained from all involved patients. Before the operation and during the first 5 postoperative days, delirium was assessed with the confusion assessment method by trained researchers twice every day. Thereafter, the preoperative bedside BIS of each patient was dynamically acquired by the BIS VISTA monitoring system and the BIS monitoring of electrodes. A series of evaluation scales were assessed before and after surgery. A preoperative predictive score was generated according to the results of multivariable logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn and the area under the curves was estimated to evaluate the perioperative diagnostic values of BIS and preoperative predictive score for POD. The specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive (NPV) value were calculated.
Delirium occurred in 50 of 308 (16.2%) patients. The median BIS of delirious patients was 86.7 (interquartile range [IQR] 80.0-94.0), lower than that of the non-delirious 91.9 (IQR 89.7-95.4, P < 0.001). According to the ROC curve of the BIS index, the optimal cut-off value was 84, with a sensitivity of 48%, specificity of 87%, PPV 43%, NPV 89% for forecasting POD and the area under curves was 0.67. While integrating BIS, mini-mental state examination, anemia, activities of daily living, and blood urea nitrogen, the model had a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 74%, PPV of 0.37%, and NPV of 95% for forecasting POD, and the area under curves was 0.83.
Preoperative bedside BIS in delirium patients was lower than that in non-delirium patients when undergoing non-neurosurgery and non-cardiac surgery in patients aged over 75.

Anesthetics could reduce the stress response during surgery and prevent sympathetic nerve overexcitation. The goal of this study was to investigate how BIS-guided anesthetic depth affected peripheral T lymphocytes in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.
A total of 60 patients having elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery were randomly assigned and analyzed (n = 30 for deep general anesthesia, BIS 35, n = 30 for light general anesthesia, BIS 55). Blood samples were collected immediately before anesthesia induction and immediately after operation, 24 h and 5 days postoperatively. The CD4+/CD8 + ratio, T lymphocyte subsets (including CD3 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, and CD8 + T cells), and natural killer (NK) cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon -ɣ (IFN-ɣ), and vascular endothelial growth factor-α (VEGF-α) were also measured.
The CD4+/CD8 + ratio decreased 24 h after surgery in two groups, but the reduction did not differ between the two groups (P > 0.05). The concentration of IL-6 and the numerical rating scale (NRS) score in the BIS 55 group were significantly higher than that in the BIS 35 group 24 h after surgery (P = 0.001). There were no intergroup differences in CD3 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, NK cells, VEGF-α, or the IFN-ɣ. Statistical analyses showed no differences between the two groups in the incidence of fever and surgical site infection during hospitalization.
Despite the fact that patients in deep general anesthesia group had low levels of the IL-6 24 h after surgery, the deep general anesthesia was not associated to a positive effect on patients' peripheral T lymphocytes during colorectal cancer surgery. We found no evidence that peripheral T lymphocyte subsets and natural killer cells were affected by the targeting a BIS of either 55 or 35 in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery in this trial.

This study aimed to determine the influence of major genetic alleles of the CYP2B6 gene, CYP2B6*2A, *6A, *3, *4A, and *5A, on the required propofol dose and response among Jordanian Arabic patients attending The University of Jordan Hospital.
A total of 155 patients were administrated propofol. The propofol response was evaluated by monitoring the time to reach the bispectral index of 60 (BIS60) for every patient. The CYP2B6 genetic variants were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction through specific enzymes for CYP2B6 variants.
It is found that patients with variant CYP2B6*2A and *4A alleles required significantly (P < 0.05) lower propofol doses, while patients with variant CYP2B6*6A, *3, and *5A alleles required higher propofol doses in comparison with patients carrying the wild CYP2B6 alleles. Patients with variant CYP2B6*2A and *3 alleles needed a significantly (P < 0.05) shorter while patients with variant CYP2B6*5A allele needed longer time of BIS

The main task of the anesthesiologist is to assess the depth of anesthesia, or, more specifically, the depth of hypnosis (DoH), and accordingly adjust the dose of intravenous anesthetic agents. However, it is not possible to directly measure the anesthetic agent concentrations or the DoH, so the anesthesiologist must rely on various vital signs and EEG-based measurements, such as the bispectral (BIS) index. The ability to better measure DoH is directly applicable in clinical practice-it improves the anesthesiologist's assessment of the patient state regarding anesthetic agent concentrations and, consequently, the effects, as well as provides the basis for closed-loop control algorithms. This article introduces a novel structure for modeling DoH, which employs a residual dynamic model. The improved model can take into account the patient's individual sensitivity to the anesthetic agent, which is not the case when using the available population-data-based models. The improved model was tested using real clinical data. The results show that the predictions of the BIS-index trajectory were improved considerably. The proposed model thus seems to provide a good basis for a more patient-oriented individualized assessment of DoH, which should lead to better administration methods that will relieve the anesthesiologist's workload and will benefit the patient by providing improved safety, individualized treatment, and, thus, alleviation of possible adverse effects during and after surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36616891/

While many studies have assessed the response of these markers to propofol sedation and anesthetic gases, few studies have compared these markers when using dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist. Fifty-one patients underwent drug induced sleep endoscopy with dexmedetomidine sedation. Continuous EEG was captured using SedLine (Masimo, Inc), and a playback system was used to extract the bispectral index (BIS) (Medtronic Inc), the patient state index (PSI) (Masimo, Inc), the state and response Entropy (GE Healthcare), and calculate the spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF95). Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores were assessed continually throughout the procedure and in recovery. We assessed the correlation between EEG markers and constructed ordinal logistic regression models to predict the RASS score and compare EEG markers. All three commercial EEG metrics were significantly associated with the RASS score (p < 0.001 for all metrics) whereas SEF95 alone was insufficient at characterizing dexmedetomidine sedation. PSI and Entropy achieved higher accuracy at predicing deeper levels of sedation as compared to BIS (PSI: 58.3%, Entropy: 58.3%, BIS: 44.4%). Lightening secondary to RASS score assessment is significantly captured by all three commercial EEG metrics (p < 0.001). Commercial EEG monitors can capture changes in the brain state associated with the RASS score during dexmedetomidine sedation.

However, few studies have compared the PLE and bispectral index (BIS) methods for monitoring consciousness during clinical anesthesia, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) or anesthesia via inhalation. Therefore, we evaluated differences between the PLE and BIS methods in clinical anesthesia, including TIVA using propofol and anesthesia with sevoflurane.
The observational trial included 60 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. The BIS and PLE electrodes were placed together on the left temporal-frontal area of all patients. During anesthesia, anesthetic levels were adjusted using the BIS values, which are generally used to monitor the DoA; the level of anesthesia was maintained at between 40 and 60. BIS- and PLE-derived values were recorded continuously. Anesthetic events, the concentration of each anesthetic, and standard monitoring values were recorded. The patients included were divided into 2 groups, the TIVA and sevoflurane groups, with 30 patients in each. For the TIVA group, anesthesia was induced and maintained using propofol and remifentanil target-controlled infusion. For the sevoflurane group, anesthesia was induced using propofol and maintained using sevoflurane and remifentanil.
From loss of consciousness until the anesthetic maintenance period, PLE values were higher than BIS values at several time points. During the recovery period, BIS values were higher than PLE values (all P < .001). Spaghetti plots showed that there was more variation among the BIS values than among the PLE values.
For monitoring DoA during general anesthesia and surgery, PLE values vary less than BIS values; thus, PLE may be more reliable for monitoring changes in consciousness.

We acquired 21-electrode EEG data and bispectral index (BIS) values of 50 patients undergoing surgery from before anesthesia induction until after patient arousal. For each epoch of a 10.24-s window with 1-s offsets, we calculated frontal alpha power [Formula: see text], occipital alpha power [Formula: see text], and their difference [Formula: see text] to quantify anteriorization.

Forty 19-65 year-old patients scheduled to undergo surgery using i-gel were enrolled. Anesthesia was induced using remimazolam infusion (12 mg/kg/h). Simultaneously, remifentanil was infused at a predetermined Ce. After 5 min of anesthesia induction, the i-gel was inserted. The 95% EC (EC95) of remifentanil in each patient was determined using a biased-coin up-and-down method based on a successful insertion in a preceding patient. The step size of remifentanil Ce was 0.4 ng/ml. If the insertion failed, remifentanil Ce was increased in the next patient. Following successful insertions, the corresponding concentration decreased in subsequent patients with a probability of 1/19 or was maintained with a probability of 18/19.

Although it is common that the depth of sedation is assessed by validated instruments such as the modified observer's assessment of alertness and sedation (MOAA/S) score, the repeated stimulation associated with the assessment can affect the sedation. The bispectral index (BIS) has been widely used for general anesthesia due to its objective and noninvasive nature. However, the utility of BIS monitoring and a target BIS value for use during bronchoscopy have not been fully elucidated.
We performed a retrospective observational study to assess the utility of the BIS value for monitoring conscious sedation during bronchoscopy at Kobe University Hospital from August 2020 to April 2021.
Eighteen patients underwent bronchoscopy with BIS monitoring. The BIS value significantly correlated with the MOAA/S score (r = 0.2, p < 0.01), and the correlation was stronger in sufficiently sedated patients (r = 0.486, p < 0.01). The lowest MOAA/S score during the procedure was highly correlated with the BIS value (r = 0.625, p < 0.01). The BIS monitoring seemed to be more sensitive to changes in the sedation level than the MOAA/S score, heart rate and mean arterial pressure. The median BIS value at an MOAA/S score of 3-4, the desired depth of sedation, was 82.0.

36042643,Effective anesthetic management with remimazolam and ketamine without muscle relaxants for parotidectomy in a patient with myotonic dystrophy: A case report.,Medicine,2022,"Ishida Y, Habu MI, Toba Y","Patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM) are highly sensitive to anesthetics, muscle relaxants, and opioids, necessitating appropriate anesthetic management. Recently, remimazolam, an ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine, has been approved for use as a general anesthetic in Japan, and patients with DM have reportedly been treated with remimazolam. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has reported on endotracheal intubation without the use of muscle relaxants under anesthetic management with remimazolam, nor on the combination of remimazolam and ketamine.
A 23-year-old man was referred to our hospital for right parotidectomy and diagnosed with DM just before surgery. At the surgeon's discretion, he was scheduled to undergo nerve monitoring to preserve the facial nerve.
Myotonic dystrophy.
We planned total intravenous anesthesia without muscle relaxants and selected remimazolam for anesthesia. Our aim was to prevent the intraoperative or postoperative complications associated with propofol and inhalational anesthetics. Additionally, we selected multimodal analgesia, including ketamine, to avoid opioid use. General anesthesia was induced with ketamine 30 mg, remifentanil 0.72 μg/kg/min, and remimazolam 12 + 6 mg. Endotracheal intubation was performed under videolaryngoscopy without the use of muscle relaxants. For postoperative analgesia, we administered additional doses of ketamine 20 mg and acetaminophen 1000 mg, and the surgeons infiltrated 8 mL of xylocaine 0.5% with epinephrine into the skin incision before starting the surgery. Intraoperative anesthesia was maintained with remimazolam 0.9 to 1.0 mg/kg/h and remifentanil 0.26 to 0.50 μg/kg/min. Flumazenil was administered for rapid awakening and safe extubation. All vitals, including the bispectral index, were stable during surgery.
The patient did not develop facial nerve paralysis, sore throat, or hoarseness, nor did he have any memory of the surgery. Good postoperative analgesia was achieved.
We achieved effective anesthetic management using remimazolam without muscle relaxants in a patient with DM. Furthermore, the combination of remimazolam and ketamine provided good sedation and postoperative analgesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36042643/

Tertiary university hospital operating room.
Forty-two patients aged 20-80 years who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery under spinal anesthesia and had American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I to III were enrolled in this study.
Dexmedetomidine was administered with a loading dose of 0.5-1 μg/kg for 10 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.3-0.6 μg/kg/h.
The depth of sedation was assessed using the modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (MOAA/S) scale; the data for PLE and BIS were collected; and vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, EKG, and pulse oximetry, were evaluated.
215,082 data points for the MOAA/S score and PLE and BIS values were analyzed. The baseline variabilities of PLE and BIS were 4.53% and 7.02%, respectively. The Spearman correlation coefficients of the MOAA/S score with PLE and BIS were 0.599 and 0.566, respectively. The prediction probabilities of the MOAA/S score with PLE and BIS were 0.647 and 0.636, respectively. When the MOAA/S score was 3 points, the mean (SD) values of PLE and BIS were 68.35 (15.68) and 75.85 (9.81), respectively, However, the mean (SD) values of PLE and BIS for an MOAA/S score of 1 point were 56.08 (12.49) and 68.29 (12.65), respectively.

This prospective observational study included 38 patients undergoing hysteroscopic surgery. Remimazolam and remifentanil were the main anesthetic agents without an NMBA, and a supraglottic airway was inserted to protect the airway. The induction time, amount of each anesthetic agent used during anesthesia, intraoperative bispectral index (BIS) hemodynamic parameters, and recovery profiles were measured.
General anesthesia was successfully administered to 37 patients using remimazolam and remifentanil without NMBA.

We manually controlled the intraoperative TBC to maintain moderate sedation, according to the clinical signs and bispectral index values. Of the regulated TBC values, the value farthest from value A was defined as value B. The maximum discrepancy between values B and A and the induction time were compared among the three groups.
The maximum discrepancy (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) was significantly larger in group 3 (1.0 ± 1.3 μg/ml, p = .005) and group 2 (0.8 ± 0.2 μg/ml p = .008) than in group 1 (0.5 ± 0.3 μg/ml).

Quality of recovery is an important component of health care quality, but there is no published randomized control trial focused on the quality of recovery in patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia with remimazolam.
This parallel-group, single-blind randomized control trial at a tertiary care medical center in South Korea was conducted to determine the difference in the quality of recovery between the patients administered remimazolam and those administered an inhalant anesthetic agent. A total of 168 patients aged 19-65 years who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy or robotic gynecologic surgery were considered for enrollment. Randomization was performed using sealed envelopes containing computer-generated random allocation sequences.

The induction protocol and the target value of the bispectral index were identical in both groups. Patients were blinded to the drug that was administered until they finished the postoperative questionnaire. The main outcome measure was the decrement of the QoR-40 score on postoperative day 1 compared to the QoR-40 score on the day before surgery.
A total of 165 patients were analyzed. The preoperative and postoperative global QoR-40 scores were 183 and 152 (IQR 173-192 and 136-169), respectively. The perioperative decrement of the global QoR-40 score was 29.96 ± 22.49. The decrement of the QoR-40 score was smaller in Group R than in Group D (26.99 versus 32.90, respectively; mean difference 5.91, 95% confidence interval -0.96-12.79). After adjustment for sex, the type of surgery and surgical time, the administration of remimazolam resulted in a 7.03-point (95% CI 0.35-13.72) less decrement of the QoR-40 score than desflurane. There were no severe adverse events in either group.
Total intravenous anesthesia maintained with remimazolam provides a better quality of recovery than anesthesia maintained with an inhalant agent in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Additionally, postoperative nausea and vomiting were largely reduced with remimazolam.

Laser laryngeal surgery (LLS) requires the administration of low levels of oxygen, which may increase the risk of desaturation and brain function impairment. This prospective randomized trial aimed to compare the effects of desflurane and propofol-based general anesthesia on the occurrence of early postoperative cognitive decline in elderly patients undergoing LLS.
Seventy-three patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II and at least 65 years of age were randomly allocated to receive either desflurane-based (Group D) or propofol-based (Group P) anesthesia during LLS. The standard anesthesia protocol was performed, with a bispectral index between 40 and 60 and a mean arterial pressure within 20% of baseline values. Intraoperative regional oxygen saturation values were recorded. Each patient was assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) test during the preoperative period (baseline), 30 min after extubation in the postanesthesia care unit, and 1, 3, and 24 h after surgery.
MMSE scores improved slightly in both groups compared to baseline during the early postoperative period, but these increases were not statistically significant. No significant differences were identified in MMSE scores between groups. Only three patients (9.6%) in group D and one patient (3.1%) in group P developed cognitive impairment (p = 0.583).
Low intraoperative inspired oxygen concentration during short-duration LLS did not reduce early postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients. Desflurane or propofol-based anesthesia had similar effects on early neurocognition after LLS.

Monitoring devices, anesthetic drugs, understanding of procedures and management of complications are critical aspects.
New data are available regarding risk factors for intra- and postoperative complications (based on anesthesia registries), airway management, new anesthetic drugs, techniques of administration and management of advances in interventional endoscopy procedures.
Digestive tract endoscopy is a common procedure that takes place outside the operating room most of the time and has become more and more complex due to advanced invasive procedures. Prior evaluation of the patient's comorbidities and a good understanding of the objectives and constraints of the endoscopic procedures are required. Assessing the risk of gastric content aspiration is critical for determining appropriate anesthetic protocols. The availability of adequate monitoring (capnographs adapted to spontaneous ventilation, bispectral index), devices for administration of anesthetic/sedative agents (target-controlled infusion) and oxygenation (high flow nasal oxygenation) guarantees the quality of sedation and patient' safety during endoscopic procedures.

Anaesthesia practitioners can learn to interpret the EEG in a short tutorial and may be quicker and more accurate thanBIS in assessing anaesthesia depth by recognising EEG patterns. We hypothesise that quality of recovery (QoR) in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery is better, if propofol is titrated by anaesthesia practitioners able to interpret the EEG.

Secondary outcomes are propofol consumption, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and postoperative delirium.QoR and propofol consumption are compared between both groups using a two-sample t-test. Fisher's exact test is used to compare the incidences of PONV and delirium.

The objective of the study was to prove whether ciprofol was non-inferior to propofol for the successful induction of general anesthesia. The ideal post-induction sedation level was assessed by comparing patients' clinical symptoms and their hemodynamic effects in responding to noxious stimuli, mostly tracheal intubation and bispectral index (BIS) alterations following ciprofol/propofol administration.
In this multi-center, randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial, selective surgery patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either ciprofol 0.4 mg/kg (n = 88) or propofol 2.0 mg/kg (n = 88) groups. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with successful anesthesia inductions. Secondary endpoints included the times to successful induction of general anesthesia and loss of the eyelash reflex, changes in BIS, as well as safety indicators.
The anesthesia induction success rates for both ciprofol 0.4 mg/kg and propofol 2 mg/kg groups were 100.0%, with a 95% CI lower success limit of -4.18% difference between the two groups, indicating that ciprofol was non-inferior to propofol. For secondary outcomes, the average time to successful anesthesia and loss of the eyelash reflex were 0.91 min and 0.80 min for ciprofol and 0.80 min and 0.71 min for propofol, respectively. The pattern of BIS changes with ciprofol was similar to propofol and stable during the anesthesia maintenance period. Safety was comparable with 88.6% TEAEs in the ciprofol group compared to 95.5% in the propofol group. The incidence of injection pain was significantly lower in the ciprofol group compared to the propofol group (6.8% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.05).

It has uncertain aetiology, limited preventative strategies, and poor long-term outcomes. This updated systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the effect of processed electroencephalography (pEEG)-guided general anaesthesia during surgery on POD incidence.
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) electronic databases. Studies of adult patients having general anaesthesia for any surgery where pEEG was used and POD was an outcome measure were included. Full-text reports of RCTs published from database inception until August 28, 2021, were included. Trials were excluded if sedation rather than general anaesthesia was administered, or the setting was intensive care. The primary outcome was POD assessed by validated tools. The study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO.
Nine studies, which included 4648 eligible subjects, were identified. The incidence of POD in the pEEG-guided general anaesthesia or lighter pEEG target group was 19.0% (440/2310) compared with 23.3% (545/2338) in the usual care or deeper pEEG target group (pooled odds ratio=0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.00; P=0.054). Significant heterogeneity was detected (I
Our primary analysis demonstrated a highly sensitive result with a pooled analysis of trials in which the intervention group adhered to manufacturer's recommended guidelines, showing reduced incidence of POD with pEEG guidance.

The combination of remifentanil and propofol for deep sedation decreases the incidents of movement, cough, and hiccup. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of remifentanil during endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition.
We retrospectively reviewed patients in whom endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition was performed for solid mass lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract and adjacent organs. All patients were premedicated with midazolam (2 mg), and target-controlled infusion of propofol, opioid, and Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring were administered as necessary to maintain moderate-to-deep sedation. The opioids used were a bolus of alfentanil or remifentanil infusion. The discharge time, consumption of propofol and opioid, adverse events, diagnostic accuracy, and sensitivity and specificity for malignancy, were compared.
Tissue acquisition was achieved in 123 patients (alfentanil group, n = 64; remifentanil group, n = 59). The discharge time of the remifentanil group (16.5 ± 3.2 min) was significantly shorter than that of the alfentanil group (19.0 ± 4.9 min, P = 0.001). The consumption of propofol, adverse events, diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for malignancy in the alfentanil group were not significantly different from those in the remifentanil group.

The present study aimed to assess the effects of body mass index (BMI) on the pharmacodynamic index of propofol TCI.
This prospective, non-randomized controlled trial evaluated 175 female patients undergoing breast lumpectomy. Anesthesia was induced with propofol using the TCI system embedded Schnider model. The effect compartment concentration was set to 3 μg/ml, and the start time of infusion was recorded. When the target concentration reached 3 μg/ml, the patient could not be awakened (Ramsay sedation score ≥4), and when the Bispectral Index (BIS) was <60, the infusion was discontinued, and the time point was recorded. The observation end-point was set at the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score of <4. The correlation between the BMI and the pharmacodynamic index of propofol was evaluated.
Propofol induction time was significantly correlated with the BMI (p < 0.001). The induction time of the underweight subjects was 10.14 ± 2.19 min, which was remarkably higher than that of normal weight (6.48 ± 3.44 min) and overweight (4.75 ± 2.53 min) individuals (p < 0.001).

This is a pilot study to determine whether a BIS nasal montage correlates to the standard frontal-temporal data in this patient population. METHODS: This prospective nonandomized pilot study enrolled 10 critically ill, intubated, and sedated adult patients admitted to the neurocritical care unit. Each patient had a BIS monitor placed over the standard frontal-temporal location and over the alternative nasal dorsum with simultaneous data collected for 24 hours. RESULTS: In the frontal-temporal location, the mean (SD) BIS score was 50.9 (15.0), average minimum BIS score was 47.0 (15.0), and average maximum BIS score was 58.4 (16.7). In the nasal dorsum location, the mean BIS score was 54.8 (21.6), average minimum BIS score was 52.8 (20.9), and average maximum BIS score was 58.0 (22.2).

In this study, the level of sedation during general anesthesia with remimazolam was evaluated using several different indicators.
Thirty patients who underwent breast surgery under general anesthesia with remimazolam were included. BIS®, Sedline® and the pupil resting diameters were measured simultaneously. The intraoperative dose of remimazolam was adjusted to obtain a BIS in the range of 40-60; if a BIS < 60 could not be achieved, the intraoperative dose was increased up to the maximal dose of 2 mg/kg/h.

Therefore, remimazolam might be a valuable option in elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis who are considered to be the most vulnerable to hemodynamic instability. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and hemodynamic effects of remimazolam as an induction agent in elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis.
This prospective, open-label, single-arm, observational pilot study was conducted in a university hospital between November 2020 and April 2021. We included 20 patients aged 65 years or older scheduled for transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis under general anesthesia. Patients were administered intravenous remimazolam infusion at 6 mg/kg/h combined with 0.25 μg/kg/min of remifentanil infusion. The primary outcome was the vasopressor dosage between the induction of anesthesia and the completion of tracheal intubation. The secondary outcomes included hemodynamic changes, bispectral index changes, and the time from the start of remimazolam infusion to loss of consciousness. We also recorded awareness during anesthesia induction and serious adverse events related to death, life-threatening events, prolonged hospitalizations, and disability due to permanent damage.
Twenty patients aged 84 [79-86] (median [interquartile range]) with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 4 were analyzed. Ephedrine 0 [0-4] mg and phenylephrine 0.1 [0-0.1] mg were administered to 14/20 patients (3 doses in 1 patient, 2 doses in 4 patients, and one dose in 9 patients). Loss of consciousness was achieved at 80 [69-86] s after the remimazolam infusion was started. The mean arterial pressure decreased gradually after loss of consciousness but recovered immediately after tracheal intubation. The bispectral index values gradually decreased and reached < 60 at 120 s after loss of consciousness. Neither awareness during induction of anesthesia nor serious adverse events, such as severe bradycardia (< 40 bpm), life-threatening arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, or anaphylactic reactions were observed.

Our objective was to correlate SctO 2 with cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) measured using positron emission tomography; OEF is the ratio between cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen and cerebral oxygen delivery and reflects the balance between these 2 variables.
This cohort study was based on data collected in a previously published trial assessing phenylephrine versus ephedrine treatment in anesthetized patients undergoing brain tumor surgery. The variables of interest were measured twice over the healthy hemisphere before surgery: the first measurement performed after anesthesia induction and the second measurement performed after induction of a ∼20% increase in blood pressure using either phenylephrine or ephedrine.
Data from 24 patients were analyzed. The overall vasopressor-induced relative changes in SctO 2 (ΔSctO 2 ) and OEF (ΔOEF) were 3.16% [interquartile range, -0.73% to 6.04%] and -12.5% [interquartile range, -24.0% to -6.19%], respectively. ΔSctO 2 negatively correlated with ΔOEF after phenylephrine treatment (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [ rs ]=-0.76; P =0.007), ephedrine treatment ( rs =-0.76; P =0.006), and any treatment ( rs =-0.79; P <0.001).

Forty children who underwent colonoscopy were divided into two groups. Lidocaine hydrochloride (1.5 mg/kg induction and 2 mg/kg/h maintenance) was given intravenously to the lidocaine group, and the same amount of saline was given to the control group after they received lidocaine induction. Propofol initial plasma concentration of 5 μg/mL was targeted, and the procedure was performed after the bispectral index value reached 55. The primary outcome was propofol requirement.

We reviewed electronic medical records of patients with VT who underwent RFCA by general anesthesia from January 2014 to March 2019. According to intraoperative VT induction, they were divided into two groups: non-inducible group (group N) and inducible group (group I). We constructed several multivariable regression models, in which covariates included patient characteristics, comorbidities, protopathy and bispectral index (BIS) value.
One hundred one patients were analyzed. Twenty-nine patients (28.7%) experienced VT no induction, and 26 patients (25.7%) relapsed within 1 year. Compared with group I, the proportion of patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in group N were higher (P < 0.05), and the recurrence rate of VT was significantly higher (51.7% vs 15.3%) (P < 0.05).

The aim of this study was to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of the pupillometer to assess pain and depth of sedation in pediatric patients undergoing painful procedures and to optimize pain management by observing pupillary variations induced by opioids.
This is a prospective, monocentric study conducted in the sedation room of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli in Rome. A population of 22 pediatric patients who underwent painful procedures was enrolled. Eleven children were sedated by opioid drugs. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, bispectral index, maximum pupil size (Size), pupil change (CH), Neurological Pupil Index (NPi) were collected over four times: before starting the procedure; before the painful stimulus (when the patient was sedated); when the painful stimulus was applied; at the end of the procedure. A NeurOptics NPi-200 pupillometer was used for the study.
Statistical significance in the variation of haemodynamic parameters was less significant than the variation obtained by analyzing the pupillary parameters: a significant change in NPi and CH in the transition from wakefulness to sedation and from the application of the painful stimulus to awakening was found in both study populations, patients who have received opioids and patients who have not received opioids. Changes in the mean CH of the pupil diameter correlate with the depth of sedation, and the size values vary in relation to the administration of opioids.

Most studies were conducted under general anesthesia or in cognitively impaired patients. It is unclear whether reducing depth of anesthesia beyond levels consistent with general anesthesia reduces delirium in cognitively intact patients. The authors' objective was to determine whether a bundled approach to reduce anesthetic agent exposure as determined by Bispectral Index (BIS) values (spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values) compared with general anesthesia (masked BIS) reduces delirium.
Important eligibility criteria for this parallel-arm randomized trial were patients 65 yr or greater undergoing lumbar spine fusion. The intervention group received spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation to BIS greater than 60 to 70. The control group received general anesthesia (masked BIS). The primary outcome was delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method daily through postoperative day 3, with blinded assessment.
The median age of 217 patients in the analysis was 72 (interquartile range, 69 to 77). The median BIS value in the spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values group was 62 (interquartile range, 53 to 70) and in the general anesthesia with masked BIS values group was 45 (interquartile range, 41 to 50; P < 0.001). Incident delirium was not different in the spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values group (25.2% [28 of 111] vs. the general anesthesia with masked BIS values group (18.9% [20 of 106]; P = 0.259; relative risk, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.76]). In prespecified subgroup analyses, the effect of anesthetic strategy differed according to the Mini-Mental State Examination, but not the Charlson Comorbidity Index or age. Two strokes occurred among patients receiving spinal anesthesia and one death among patients receiving general anesthesia.
Spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values compared with general anesthesia with masked BIS values did not reduce delirium after lumbar fusion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34666346/

Up to 40% of PACU delirium is preventable, but it remains under-recognised due to a lack of awareness of its diagnosis. The nursing delirium screening scale (Nu-DESC) has been validated for diagnosing PACU delirium, but is not routinely used locally. This study aimed to use Nu-DESC to establish the incidence and risk factors of PACU delirium in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery in the surgical population.
We conducted an audit of eligible patients undergoing major surgery in three public hospitals in Singapore over 1 week. Patients were assessed for delirium 30-60 min following their arrival in PACU using Nu-DESC, with a total score of ≥2 indicative of delirium.
A total of 478 patients were assessed. The overall incidence rate of PACU delirium was 18/478 (3.8%), and the incidence was 9/146 (6.2%) in patients aged > 65 years. Post-anaesthesia care unit delirium was more common in females, patients with malignancy and those who underwent longer operations. Logistic regression analysis showed that the use of bispectral index (P < 0.001) and the presence of malignancy (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with a higher incidence of PACU delirium.
In this first local study, the incidence of PACU delirium was 3.8%, increasing to 6.2% in those aged > 65 years. Understanding these risk factors will form the basis for which protocols can be established to optimise resource management and prevent long-term morbidities and mortality in PACU delirium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34628800/

However, external environmental factors, such as bright surgical lights, may hamper patient relaxation, which may lead to an increase in the dose of midazolam required and the likelihood of adverse drug effects. We investigated whether using an eye mask to block the external environment could reduce midazolam requirements during spinal anesthesia.
Participants aged 18-‒80 years, scheduled for elective surgery under spinal anesthesia, were randomly divided into a masked group (wearing eye masks during surgery, n = 20) and a control group (no mask, n = 18). The sedation level was assessed using a modified Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (MOAA/S) scale. Midazolam (1 mg) was incrementally administered every 5 min until moderate sedation (MOAA/S score of 3) was achieved. The bispectral index (BIS) was monitored, and the onset and maintenance times of a BIS < 80 were recorded.
The two groups had similar demographic characteristics. The midazolam requirements were significantly lower in the masked group than in the control group (2.8 mg vs. 3.7 mg, P = 0.024). However, the onset and maintenance times for a BIS < 80 were similar. In addition, there were no significant differences in the incidence of side effects or patient satisfaction between the two groups.
Blocking the external environment with an eye mask during spinal anesthesia can reduce the requirement for sedatives, such as midazolam.

In total, 64 patients who suffered from ACI with consciousness disturbance were enrolled in this study. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was performed to evaluate the consciousness level of ACI patients, and BIS was used to monitor the depth of anesthesia and sedation. Then, patients were divided into good prognosis, poor prognosis and death groups according to Modified Rankin Score (mRS). Discrimination analysis of BIS values and GCS score for the prediction of prognosis was performed using the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve.
GCS score and BIS values showed statistically significant differences among the three groups. Spearman rank correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between BIS values and GCS score, while BIS values was negatively related with mRS. The ROC curve of prognosis prediction showed strong prognostic power, with Area Under the Curves (AUCs) between 0.830 and 0.917. Moreover, the AUC of BISmean score was higher than that of BISmax, BISmin and GCS, and BISmean of 74 was the best cut-off point for good prognosis.

Midazolam has a good anterograde amnesia-inducing effect, can prevent and reduce the occurrence of intraoperative awareness. However, if the dosage of midazolam is improperly controlled, it may not produce forgetting effect, or bring obvious adverse side effects, such as respiratory depression, and delay of recovery. However, the half maximal effective dose (ED50 ) of midazolam for amnesia, the duration of amnesia and the factors affecting the duration of amnesia are still inconclusive. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to observe and determine the dose, duration and influencing factors of amnesia induced by midazolam METHODS: A total of 106 patients who underwent ASA grades I-II elective operation under spinal-epidural anesthesia were intravenously injected with different doses of midazolam at 10 minutes after spinal-epidural anesthesia, every 5 minutes, the patient was presented with pictures or sounds as memory content, and heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), bispectral index (BIS), OAA/S and adverse events were recorded. The patient's forgetfulness was followed up in the early morning after operation.
ED50 (the dose for amnesia in half of the subjects) was 0.031 mg/kg (95% CI: 0.027-0.036 mg/kg); ED95 (the dose for amnesia in 95% of the subjects) was 0.044 mg/kg (95% CI: 0.038-0.071 mg/kg). After the patients were injected intravenously with 0.04 mg/kg of midazolam, the respiratory and circulatory systems were basically stable, no serious adverse events occurred, and the forgetting rate was 88.5%. ET50 (the time for half of the subjects in a state of forgetfulness) was 23.77 minutes (95% CI: 20.18-27.07 min), and the corresponding BIS was 83.22; ET05 (the time for 5% of the subjects in a state of forgetfulness) was 53.90 minutes (95% CI: 48.54-61.47 min) and the corresponding BIS was 91.38. The amnesia-inducing effect of midazolam was correlated to sedation grade, BIS and age, and was not correlated to visual memory or auditory memory.

Il mantenimento della coscienza intraoperatoria è un incidente grave in anestesia generale. Il Midazolam ha un buon effetto induttore di amnesia anterograda, può prevenire e ridurre l'insorgenza di questo evento negativo. Tuttavia, se il dosaggio di midazolam è controllato in modo improprio, potrebbe non produrre effetti di dimenticanza o portare evidenti effetti collaterali negativi, come depressione respiratoria e ritardo del risveglio. Tuttavia, la mezza dose massima efficace (ED50) di midazolam per l'amnesia, la durata dell'amnesia e i fattori che influenzano la durata dell'amnesia sono ancora inconcludenti. Pertanto, è di grande interesse clinico osservare e determinare la dose, la durata e i fattori di induzione dell'amnesia indotti dal midazolam. Ad un totale di 106 pazienti di grado I-II ASA sottoposti a intervento elettivo in anestesia spinale-epidurale sono stati iniettate per via endovenosa diverse dosi di midazolam a 10 minuti dopo l'anestesia spinale-epidurale. Ogni 5 minuti sono state presentate al paziente immagini o suoni con contenuti memorizzabili, e sono stati registrati frequenza cardiaca (HR), pressione sistolica (SBP), pressione diastolica (DBP), pressione sanguigna media (MBP), saturazione di ossigeno nel sangue (SpO2), indice bispettrale (BIS), OAA/S ed eventi negativi. L'amnesia del paziente è stata controllata al mattino presto successivo all'intervento. RISULTATI: la dose per produzione dell’amnesia nella metà dei soggetti (ED50) è stata di 0,031 mg/kg (IC al 95%: 0,027-0,036 mg/kg); la dose per produzione dell’amnesia nel 95% dei soggetti (ED95) è stata di 0,044 mg/kg (IC 95%: 0,038-0,071 mg/kg). Dopo l’iniezione e.v. di 0,04 mg/kg di midazolam, i sistemi respiratorio e circolatorio sono rimasti sostanzialmente stabili, non si sono verificati eventi negativi gravi e la percentuale di amnesia è stata dell'88,5%. La durata in stato di amnesia per la metà dei soggetti (ET50) è stata di 23,77 minuti (IC al 95%: 20,18-27,07 min) e il BIS corrispondente era 83,22. La durata in stato di amnesia per il 5% dei soggetti (ET05) è stato di 53,90 minuti (IC al 95%: 48,54-61,47 min) e il BIS corrispondente era 91,38.

We recorded the BIS, electromyograph (EMG) activity on a BIS monitor (EMG_BIS), PLE, and EMG activity on a PLE monitor (EMG_PLE) in 40 patients receiving general anesthesia. During the awake state, we analyzed the changes in parameters before and 2 min after the eyes were closed. During sedation, we compared the changes in the parameters before and at 4 min after injecting rocuronium (group R) or normal saline (group C) between the two groups. During anesthesia, we compared the changes in parameters before and at 4 min after injecting sugammadex (group B) or normal saline (group D) between the two groups. During the awake state, the BIS, EMG_BIS, and EMG_PLE, but not PLE, decreased significantly with closed eyes. An effect of EMG on the BIS was evident, but not on PLE. During sedation, the BIS decreased with the decrease in EMG_BIS regardless of NMB caused by rocuronium, but NMB decreased PLE, although the degree of the decrease in EMG_PLE after NMB was similar to that after placebo. To determine the effect of NMB on electroencephalograms (EEGs) in groups R and C, we plotted the power spectra before and at 4 min after injecting rocuronium or normal saline. Changes in slow and delta frequency bands were observed at 4 min after injecting rocuronium relative to before injecting rocuronium. There was no effect of EMG on either the BIS or PLE during anesthesia.

However, the extent to which they affect general anesthesia remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of circadian rhythms on anesthetic depth and the concentrations of propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI).
Sixty patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries were sequentially assigned to four groups. Group ND (n = 15): Propofol TCI with Narcotrend monitor during the day (8:00-18:00), Group NN (n = 15): Propofol TCI with Narcotrend monitor during the night (22:00-5:00), Group CLTD (n = 15): Propofol closed-loop TCI guided by bispectral index (BIS) during the day (8:00-18:00), Group CLTN (n = 15): Propofol closed-loop TCI guided by BIS during the night (22:00-5:00). The Narcotrend index, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were compared between group ND and NN at 7 time points, from 5 min before induction to the end of operation. The propofol TCI concentrations, MAP and HR were compared between group CLTD and CLTN at 7 time points, from 5 min after induction to the end of operation.
The Narcotrend index, MAP, and HR in group NN were lower than those in group ND from the beginning of mechanical ventilation to the end of operation (p < 0.05). The propofol TCI concentrations in group CLTN were lower than those in group CLTD from the beginning of operation to the end of operation (p < 0.05).
Circadian rhythms have a significant effect on the depth of anesthesia and drug infusion concentrations during propofol TCI. When using general anesthesia during night surgery, the propofol infusion concentration should be appropriately reduced compared to surgery during the day.

During the operation, the use of boosting drugs and ephedrine, amount of fluid infusion, amount of bleeding, and operation time of the 2 participant groups were recorded, as well as the pain score in the resting state.
During anesthesia, the bispectral index (BIS) value of Group G was significantly lower than that of Group T, the use of sufentanil and the use rate of ephedrine were significantly higher than that of Group T, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05).

Moreover, because of a short operation time, it is associated with challenging anesthetic management. The aim of this study was to compare the usefulness of continuous administration of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil in inducing general anesthesia in patients undergoing LMS.
This is a prospective randomized control design. Continuous intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine (group D) or remifentanil (group R) was administered from 10 minutes before the induction of anesthesia to the end of surgery. In both groups, 1.5 mg/kg propofol and 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium were administered for the induction of anesthesia, and desflurane were titrated during the measurement of the bispectral index. We recorded hemodynamic data, recovery time, grade of cough, pain score, and analgesic requirements during the perioperative period.
61 patients were finally analyzed (30 for group D, 31 for group R). The incidence of moderate to severe postoperative sore throat was higher in group R than in group D (42% vs 10%, P = .008), and the quantity of rescue fentanyl used in post-anesthesia care unit was significantly higher in group R than in group D (23.2 ± 24.7 mg vs 3.3 ± 8.6 mg; P < .001); however, the time required for eye opening was significantly longer in group D than in group R (599.4 ± 177.9 seconds vs 493.5 ± 103.6 seconds; P = .006). The proportion of patients with no cough or single cough during extubation was comparable between the 2 groups (group D vs group R: 73% vs 70%) as was the incidence of hemodynamic instability.
Although there was a transient delay in emergence time, dexmedetomidine reduced postoperative opioid use and the incidence of sore throat. Dexmedetomidine may be used as an alternative agent to opioids in patients undergoing LMS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34449490/

Although some cases of delirium can be avoided by early intervention, there is no clear evidence indicating whether any of these measures can effectively prevent POD in specific patient groups.
The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of the existing preventive measures for managing POD.
The PubMed, OVID (Embase and MEDLINE), Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for articles published before January 2020. The relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction and methodological quality assessment were performed according to a predesigned data extraction form and scoring system, respectively. The interventions were compared on the basis of the primary outcome like incidence of POD, and secondary outcomes like duration of delirium and the length of intensive care unit and hospital stay.
Sixty-three RCTs were included in the study, covering interventions like surgery, anesthesia, analgesics, intraoperative blood glucose control, cholinesterase inhibitors, anticonvulsant drugs, antipsychotic drugs, sleep rhythmic regulation, and multi-modal nursing. The occurrence of POD was low in 4 trials that monitored the depth of anesthesia with bispectral index during the operation (P < .0001). Two studies showed that supplementary analgesia was useful for delirium prevention (P = .002). Seventeen studies showed that perioperative sedation with α2-adrenergic receptor agonists prevented POD (P = .0006). Six studies showed that both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs can reduce the incidence of POD (P = .002). Multimodal nursing during the perioperative period effectively reduced POD in 6 studies (P < .00001). Furthermore, these preventive measures can reduce the duration of delirium, as well as the total and postoperative length of hospitalized stay for non-cardiac surgery patients. For patients undergoing cardiac surgery, effective prevention can only reduce the length of intensive care unit stay.
Measures including intraoperative monitoring of bispectral index, supplemental analgesia, α2-adrenergic receptor agonists, antipsychotic drugs, and multimodal care are helpful to prevent POD effectively. However, larger, high-quality RCTs are needed to verify these findings and develop more interventions and drugs for preventing postoperative delirium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34398027/

In this clinical trial, parturient undergoing elective Caesarian section were randomized into two groups receiving either low-dose (5 mg/kg) or high-dose (7 mg/kg) STP. Muscle relaxation was provided with succinylcholine 2 mg/kg and anesthesia was maintained with O2/N2O and sevoflurane. The depth of anesthesia was evaluated using isolated forearm technique (IFT) and bispectral index (BIS) in various phases. Additionally, infants were assessed using Apgar score and neurobehavioral test.
Forty parturient were evaluated in each group. BIS was significantly lower in high-dose group at skin incision to delivery and subcutaneous and skin closure. Also, significant differences were noticed in IFT over induction to incision and incision to delivery. Apgar score was significantly lower in high-dose group at 1 min after delivery. Newborn infants in low-dose group had significantly better outcomes in all three domains of the neurobehavioral test.
7 mg/kg STP is superior to 5 mg/kg in creating deeper hypnosis for mothers. However, it negatively impacts Apgar score and neurobehavioral test of neonates. STP seems to has dropped behind as an acceptable anesthetic in Cesarean section.

The BIS has been demonstrated as inaccurate when neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) are used. Compared with BIS, phase lag entropy (PLE), which measures the anesthetic depth based on a 4-channel EEG signal, is less affected by EMG. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of EMG activity during emergence on anesthetic depth monitoring between PLE and BIS.
Twenty five consecutive patients with physical status I-II of American Society of Anesthesiologists undergoing general anesthesia (age range, 20-60 years). The anesthesiologist attached the sensors of BIS and PLEM 100 on the patient's forehead. NMB reversal was performed by intravenously injecting sugammadex after confirmation of shallow NMB (TOF count 1-4) under neuromuscular monitoring. The BIS and PLE scores were recorded with neuromuscular monitoring at 1-min intervals for 5 min after administration of sugammadex.
The BIS and BIS-EMG measured at 1 min after sugammadex injection were significantly higher at 1 min [51.650 (46.100, 62.225) (P<0.001); 28.500 (27.800, 31.075) (P=0.003)] than at 0 min. However, there was no between-time point difference in the PLE score and PLE-EMG (P=0.0843, P=0.329).
In general anesthesia using propofol-remifentanil, the BIS at 1 min after sugammadex reversal during emergence appears to be more affected by EMG activity than the PLE score. Therefore, immediately after sugammadex administration (within 1 min), it may be clinically useful to evaluate the consciousness status through the PLE score.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34328012/

A recent study reported that during general surgery, the given concentration of volatile anaesthetics, expressed as a fraction of the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC fraction), decreases by around only 3% per age-decade, which is less than the 6% expected from age-adjusted MAC. Paradoxically, despite the excessive dosing, Bispectral index (BIS) values also increased.
We planned to investigate the paradox of age when using the Narcotrend depth of anaesthesia monitor.
Secondary analyses of a prospective observational study.
Tertiary hospital in Switzerland, recordings took place during 2016 and 2017.
One thousand and seventy-two patients undergoing cardiac surgery entered the study, and 909 with noise-free recordings and isoflurane anaesthesia were included in this analysis.
We calculated mean end-tidal MAC fraction and mean index value of the Narcotrend depth of sedation monitor used in the study during the prebypass period. Statistical associations were modelled using linear regression, local weighted regression (LOESS) and a generalised additive model (GAM).
Primary endpoints in this study were the change in end-tidal MAC fraction and mean Narcotrend index values, both measured per age-decade.
We observed a linear decrease in end-tidal MAC fraction of 3.2% per age-decade [95% confidence interval (CI) -3.97% to -2.38%, P < 0.001], consistent with previous findings. In contrast to the BIS, mean Narcotrend index values decreased with age at 3.0 index points per age-decade (95% CI, -3.55 points to -2.36 points, P < 0.001), a direction of change commensurate with the increasing age-adjusted MAC fraction with patient age. These relationships were consistent regardless of whether age-adjusted MAC was displayed on the anaesthetic machine.
We caution that the 'paradox of age' may in part depend on the choice of depth of sedation monitor.

Suppressive actions of the brain to terminate the seizure are thought to be necessary for the efficacy of ECT. On the other hand, recent studies showed an association of burst suppression in general anesthesia or sedation with (postprocedural) cognitive complications.
We retrospectively examined the length of postictal burst suppression and reorientation time in 49 ECT sessions of 25 consecutive patients. Burst suppression duration was determined by bispectral index monitoring and defined as the time with a bispectral index value of less than 20%. The association between duration of burst suppression and reorientation time was analyzed with multivariate logistic and linear regression analysis controlling for several covariates.
The reorientation time showed a statistically significant association with the duration of burst suppression, but with no other variable. Longer phase of postictal burst suppression predicted longer reorientation time in the recovery room (P = 0.046).
The association between the duration of postictal burst suppression and reorientation time after ECT in this sample suggests that (not only the efficacy but also the) cognitive adverse effects of ECT might be related to the extent of postictal central inhibition after the termination of the seizure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34294649/

Patients subjected to retinal ophthalmic surgical procedures were randomized to one of two intraoperative sedation groups: one group (n=21) received intranasal dexmedetomidine plus intravenous remifentanil (DEX-REMI group), and the other group (n=19) received intravenous remifentanil only (REM group). The treatment was placebo-controlled. The sedation level was controlled according to the bispectral index, with target values between 80%-90%. Patient levels of comfort, sedation, and pain were documented. The number of intraoperative complications and the level of satisfaction were assessed. Remifentanil consumption and hemodynamic parameters were also included in the statistical analysis.
The level of remifentanil consumption was significantly lower in the DEX-REMI group, but combination sedation improved the surgeon's, anesthesiologist's, and patients' satisfaction scores. Importantly, the number of complications was zero in the DEX-REMI group, while eight cases of complications were noted in the REM group. The DEX-REMI group showed lower mean minimal arterial pressure, but it was still in the normotensive range.

Telomere length (TL) is a unique heritable trait, and emerging as a biomarker of aging, health and disease. Telomerase RNA component (TERC) plays an important role in maintaining TL. We proposed a hypothesis that propofol dose in general anesthesia can be predicted by measuring TL before operation, which greatly reduced the risk of anesthesia, especially the elderly.
The association between the propofol dose in anesthesia induction and: TL in the DNA of peripheral blood leukocytes; body weight; sex; difference of the Bispectral Index (BIS) before and after anesthesia induction in patients was evaluated by multivariable linear regression analyses. The mutation at the 5'end or 3'end of TERC was detected. We recruited 100 patients of elective surgery.
We found that propofol dose in anesthesia induction was clearly correlated significantly with TL (r = 0.78, p < 0.001), body weight (r = 0.84, p = 0.004), sex (r = 0.83, p= 0.84, p = 0.004), sex (r = 0.83, p = 0.004), and difference of BIS before and after anesthesia induction (r = 0.85, p = 0.029). By comparing the absolute values of standardized regression coefficients (0.58, 0.21, 0.19, and 0.12) of the four variables, it can be seen that TL contributes the most to the propofol dose in anesthesia induction. However, the mutation at the 5' end or 3' end of TERC was not found.
These findings provide preliminary evidence that the propofol dose in anesthesia induction was clearly correlated with genetically determined TL. TL may be a promising predictor of the propofol dose, which is beneficial to improve the safety of anesthesia and reduce perioperative complications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34119568/

The ability to emerge patients from anesthesia quickly to detect neurological abnormalities immediately after surgery is vital in this patient population. The objective of this pilot study was to assess if any of three general anesthetic techniques for CEA are associated with a shorter time to a reliable postoperative neurological exam. Secondary objectives were to assess postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), postoperative delirium (POD), and hemodynamic stability. Twenty-one patients undergoing CEA were enrolled and randomized to different combinations of inhalational and intravenous anesthesia: Group A: propofol, remifentanil, and desflurane; Group B: dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, and desflurane; Group C: remifentanil and desflurane. Anesthetic depth was titrated using a bispectral index (BIS) monitor to a goal of 50-60. Time was recorded from surgery end to first meaningful neurological exam. Neurocognitive testing was completed preoperatively and up to 1 week postoperatively to assess POD (3D-CAM) and POCD (Short Blessed Test). Time to first reliable neurological exam was 2 minutes longer in group A (9 min ± 4 min) compared to group B and group C (7 min ± 3 min; 7 min ± 4 min), although this was not statistically significant. In addition, extubation time was significantly longer in group A (11 min) compared to group B and group C (5 min; 6 min) (P = 0.03). 3D -CAM and Short Blessed Test data along with hemodynamics did not differ significantly between the groups.

These include postoperative cognitive dysfunction or delirium as well as cerebrovascular accidents. During surgery, it is essential to ensure an adequate degree of sedation and analgesia, and at the same time, to provide hemodynamic and respiratory stability in order to minimize neurological complications. In this context, the role of neuromonitoring in the operating room is gaining interest, even in the non-neurolosurgical population. The use of multimodal neuromonitoring can potentially reduce the occurrence of adverse effects during and after surgery, and optimize the administration of anesthetic drugs. In addition to the traditional focus on monitoring hemodynamic and respiratory systems during general anesthesia, the ability to constantly monitor the activity and maintenance of brain homeostasis, creating evidence-based protocols, should also become part of the standard of care: in this challenge, neuromonitoring comes to our aid. In this review, we aim to describe the role of the main types of noninvasive neuromonitoring such as those based on electroencephalography (EEG) waves (EEG, Entropy module, Bispectral Index, Narcotrend Monitor), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) based on noninvasive measurement of cerebral regional oxygenation, and Transcranial Doppler used in the perioperative settings in non-neurosurgical intervention.

As age is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD) the incidence of POD will increase concordantly. One approach to reduce the risk of POD would be to avoid excessively high doses of anaesthetics by using neuromonitoring to guide anaesthesia titration. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of patient's age on various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based anaesthesia indices.
We conducted an analysis of previously published data by replaying single electrode EEG episodes of maintenance of general anaesthesia from 180 patients (18-90 years; ASA I-IV) into the five different commercially available monitoring systems and evaluated their indices. We included the State/Response Entropy, Narcotrend, qCON/qNOX, bispectral index (BIS), and Treaton MGA-06. For a non-commercial comparison, we extracted the spectral edge frequency (SEF) from the BIS. To evaluate the influence of the age we generated linear regression models. We also assessed the correlation between the various indices.
During anaesthetic maintenance the values of the SEF, State/Response Entropy, qCON/qNOX and BIS all significantly increased (0.05 Hz/0.19-0.26 index points per year) with the patient's age (p < 0.001); whereas the Narcotrend did not change significantly with age (0.06 index points per year; p = 0.28). The index values of the Treaton device significantly decreased with age (-0.09 index points per year; p < 0.001). These findings were independent of the administered dose of anaesthetics.
Almost all current neuromonitoring devices are influenced by age, with the potential to result in inappropriately high dosage of anaesthetics. Therefore, anaesthesiologists should be aware of this phenomenon, and the next generation of monitors should correct for these changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33975095/

The preservation of spontaneous breathing during general anesthesia with anesthetic gases is practiced by many anesthetists. However, very few studies have dealt with these positive properties of volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane or desflurane. Remifentanil is a very short half-life opiate that combines sufficient intra-operative analgesia with a fast post-operative recovery time. We tested the hypothesis that spontaneous breathing can reduce overdosing with remifentanil during desflurane anesthesia. In this prospective, single center, multiple anesthetist study, 30 patients were randomized into two groups (volume-controlled ventilation mode and spontaneous breathing). The spontaneous breathing group showed a significantly lower post-operative pain level than the volume-controlled ventilation mode group. Furthermore, less remifentanil as well as less piritramide was needed in the spontaneous breathing group compared with volume-controlled ventilation mode. It was possible to achieve spontaneous breathing in all patients with 0.6 minimum alveolar concentration desflurane, in order to control the remifentanil rate and prevent an overdose. All spontaneous breathing patients had low intra- and post-operative pain levels and the need for analgesics was equal to or lower than that in the volume-controlled ventilation mode group. By reducing the intra-operative amount of opiates, both the post-operative pain and the amount of post-operative analgesia required can be reduced. A balanced anesthesia with spontaneous intra-operative breathing is needed to determine the required amount of opiates.

The BIS, BISpro, heart rate, target-concentration of propofol and Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score were recorded every 30 s in female patients scheduled for hysteroscopic surgery. Propofol anaesthesia was induced by an initial target-controlled concentration (1.0 μg/ml) followed by a stepwise increase (0.5 μg/ml) until the patient was unresponsive. Spearman's correlation coefficient and prediction probability were calculated for the association between sedation levels and the above parameters. The ability of investigated parameters to distinguish between OAA/S scores was analysed. Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare the agreement between BIS and BISpro. The BIS and BISpro cut-off values for lost response were also determined.
Out of 30 patients in total, a high correlation was found between BIS and BISpro, and both correlated well with OAA/S score. Only BIS was able to distinguish all investigated OAA/S states accurately, but the ability to predict OAA/S score 5 to loss of response was comparable between BIS and BISpro. The calculated cut-off values were 68 for BIS and 70 for BISpro.

However, the clinical assessment of anesthetic depth may not always agree with available processed EEG indices. To concurrently compare the performance of BIS and SedLine monitors, we present a data collection system using shared individual generic sensors connected to a custom-built passive interface box.
This prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized study will enroll 100 adult American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-III patients presenting for elective procedures requiring general anesthesia. BIS and SedLine electrodes will be placed preoperatively according to manufacturer recommendations and their respective indices tracked throughout anesthesia induction, maintenance and emergence. The concordance between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthesia depth will be analyzed with chi-square and kappa statistic.
Prior studies comparing brain function monitoring devices have applied both sensors on the forehead of study subjects simultaneously. With limited space and common sensor locations between devices, it is not possible to place both commercial sensor arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations, thus compromising the validity of these comparisons. This trial utilizes a custom interface allowing signals from sensors to be shared between BIS and SedLine monitors to provide an accurate comparison. Our results will also characterize the degree of agreement between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthetic depth as determined by the anesthesiologists' interpretations of acute changes in blood pressure and heart rate as well as the administration, or change to the continuous delivery, of medications at these timepoints. Patient factors (such as burst suppression state or low power EEG conditions from aging brain), surgical conditions (such as use of electrocautery), artifacts (such as electromyography), and anesthesia medications and doses (such as end-tidal concentration of volatile anesthetic or hypnotic infusion dose) that lead to lack of agreement will be explored as well.

However, precise and real-time estimation of DOA index for painful surgical operations is challenging due to problems such as postoperative complications and accidental awareness. To tackle these problems, we propose a new combinatorial deep learning structure involving convolutional neural networks (inspired by the inception module), bidirectional long short-term memory, and an attention layer. The proposed model uses the EEG signal to continuously predicts the bispectral index (BIS). It is trained over a large dataset, mostly from those under general anesthesia with few cases receiving sedation/analgesia and spinal anesthesia. Despite the imbalance distribution of BIS values in different levels of anesthesia, our proposed structure achieves convincing root mean square error of 5.59 ± 1.04 and mean absolute error of 4.3 ± 0.87, as well as improvement in area under the curve of 15% on average, which surpasses state-of-the-art DOA estimation methods.

Baseline IOP of one eye was measured immediately before general anesthesia using Perkins tonometer and then re-measured under light, intermediate, and deep anesthesia, and then after intubation. Depth of anesthesia was determined using bispectral index pediatric sensor. The agreement between the IOP measurements before and during different stages of anesthesia was analyzed using Bland-Altman plots. Systematic and proportionate deviations between the IOP measurements were analyzed.
The mean age was 58.6 ± 41.99 months. The mean IOP was significantly lower at all stages of anesthesia in both groups. The coefficient of variation was over 20% in all measurements under anesthesia. For all IOP measurements during anesthesia, the limits of agreement were > 7 mmHg difference in the control group and > 20 mmHg in the glaucomatous group. The best agreement was with the IOP measurement after intubation (mean limit of agreement of -1.4 mmHg, 1.96 s range, -8.8-6 mm Hg) in the control group and with the IOP measurement under intermediate anesthesia (mean limit of agreement of -4.2 mmHg, 1.96 s range, -15.1-6.8 mm Hg) in the glaucomatous group.

Few studies have compared EEG monitors on data from the same patient. Here, we describe a set-up to simultaneously compare the performance of three processed EEG monitors using pre-recorded EEG signals from older surgical patients.
A playback system was designed to replay EEG signals into three different commercially available EEG monitors. We could then simultaneously calculate indices from the SedLine® Root (Masimo Inc., Irvine, CA, USA; patient state index [PSI]), bilateral BIS VISTA™ (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA; bispectral index [BIS]), and Datex Ohmeda S/5 monitor with the Entropy™ Module (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA; E-entropy index [Entropy]). We tested the ability of each system to distinguish activity before anaesthesia administration (pre-med) and before/after loss of responsiveness (LOR), and to detect suppression incidences in EEG recorded from older surgical patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers. We show examples of processed EEG monitor output tested on 29 EEG recordings from older surgical patients.
All monitors showed significantly different indices and high effect sizes between comparisons pre-med to after LOR and before/after LOR. Both PSI and BIS showed the highest percentage of deeply anaesthetised indices during periods with suppression ratios (SRs) > 25%. We observed significant negative correlations between percentage of suppression and indices for all monitors (at SR >5%).

However, multiple medications used for their perioperative care can affect mitochondrial function. Defects in function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) can lead to a profound hypersensitivity to sevoflurane in children. We studied the sensitivities to sevoflurane, during mask induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, in children presenting for muscle biopsies for diagnosis of mitochondrial disease.
In this multicenter study, 91 children, aged 6 months to 16 years, presented to the operating room for diagnostic muscle biopsy for presumptive mitochondrial disease. General anesthesia was induced by a slow increase of inhaled sevoflurane concentration. The primary end point, end-tidal (ET) sevoflurane necessary to achieve a bispectral index (BIS) of 60, was recorded. Secondary end points were maximal sevoflurane used to maintain a BIS between 40 and 60 during the case, and maximum and minimum heart rate and blood pressures. After induction, general anesthesia was maintained according to the preferences of the providers directing the cases. Primary data were analyzed comparing data from patients with complex I deficiencies to other groups using nonparametric statistics in SPSS v.27.
The median sevoflurane concentration to reach BIS of 60 during inductions (ET sevoflurane % [BIS = 60]) was significantly lower for patients with complex I defects (0.98%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-1.4) compared to complex II (1.95%; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7; P < .001), complex III (2.0%; 95% CI, 0.7-3.5; P < .001), complex IV (2.0%; 95% CI, 1.7-3.2; P < .001), and normal groups (2.2%; 95% CI, 1.8-3.0; P < .001). The sevoflurane sensitivities of complex I patients did not reach significance when compared to patients diagnosed with mitochondrial disease but without an identifiable ETC abnormality (P = .172). Correlation of complex I activity with ET sevoflurane % (BIS = 60) gave a Spearman's coefficient of 0.505 (P < .001). The differences in sensitivities between groups were less during the maintenance of the anesthetic than during induction.

Nevertheless, more complex surgical procedures have brought a higher complexity and longer duration for general anesthesia, which has led to a series of adverse events such as hemodynamic instability, under- or overdosage of anesthetic drugs, and an increased number of post-anesthetic events. In order to adapt the anesthesia according to the particularities of each patient, the multimodal monitoring of these patients is highly recommended. Classically, general anesthesia monitoring consists of the analysis of vital functions and gas exchange. Multimodal monitoring refers to the concomitant monitoring of the degree of hypnosis and the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance. By titrating anesthetic drugs according to these parameters, clinical benefits can be obtained, such as hemodynamic stabilization, the reduction of awakening times, and the reduction of postoperative complications.

Literature suggests that current treatments administered in TBI care, in the intensive care unit (ICU), fail to greatly impact recorded cerebrovascular reactivity measures. In particular, the impact of sedation on cerebrovascular reactivity in traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unclear in vivo. The goal of this study was to preliminarily assess the relationship between objectively measured depth of sedation and cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI.
Within, we describe a case series of 5 adult TBI patients with TBI, during which objective high-frequency physiology for sedation depth, using bispectral index (BIS), and both intracranial pressure (ICP) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) were recorded. Pressure reactivity index (PRx) and RAP (a metric of cerebral compensatory reserve) were derived. Relationships between cerebrovascular reactivity and compensatory reserve monitoring with BIS metrics were explored using descriptive plots.
A total of 5 cases in our prospectively maintained database with high-frequency physiology for ICP, ABP, and BIS. Through error bar plotting, it can be seen that each patient displays a parabolic relationship between BIS and PRx. This suggests a potential ""optimal"" depth of sedation where cerebrovascular reactivity is the most intact.
This small series highlights the potential impact of depth of sedation on cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI. It suggests that there may be an individual optimal depth of sedation, so as to optimize cerebrovascular reactivity. Further study of objective depth of sedation and its impact on cerebrovascular physiology in TBI is required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33404872/

There exists some literature demonstrating that the nociceptive stimuli experienced during surgery are responsible for peripheral and central sensitization phenomena, which can in turn lead to persistent postsurgical pain. An individualized approach to the evaluation and treatment of perioperative nociception is beneficial in order to avoid the sensitization phenomena that leads to prolonged postoperative pain and to minimize the consumption of opiates and their adverse effects. In terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values when compared to heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), recent literature has shown that the NOL variation (ΔNOL) is the best index to distinguish noxious from non-noxious stimuli. Chronic treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonists may constitute a limitation to the use of the NOL index. β1-adrenergic antagonists induce a depressive action on the heart rate, which results in a limitation of its variability after a noxious stimulus. Since heart rate and heart rate variability are two parameters integrated into the NOL index, the validity of the NOL index in a population of patients receiving β1-adrenergic antagonists has not yet been determined. Our study sought to explore the NOL index, the BIS, and the heart rate variation in a group of patients under chronic treatment with β1-adrenergic antagonists submitted to standardized noxious stimulus under general anesthesia. We then compared those results to a control group of patients from our previous study (CJA group) that received no β1-adrenergic antagonist chronic treatment. The patients in this study were subjected to a standardized anesthetic protocol from induction up to 3 min after a standardized tetanic stimulus to the ulnar nerve at a frequency of 100 Hz and an amperage of 70 mA, for a duration of 30 s. Data were electronically recorded to obtain NOL, BIS, and heart rate values every 5 s for the duration of the protocol. The NOL maximal mean value reached after noxious stimulation was not different between our two cohorts (CJA: 30(14) versus BETANOL: 36(14) (p = 0.12)). There was no statistically significant difference between our cohorts in regards of the NOL AUC representing the variation of the NOL over a 180 s period (CJA: 595(356) versus BETANOL: 634(301) (p = 0.30)). However, a repeated measurement ANCOVA identified slight statistically significant differences between our cohorts in the peak of variation of the NOL index between 20 and 65 s after noxious stimulation, the NOL index of the cohort of beta-blocked patients being higher than the CJA patients. Moreover, the time to reach the maximum value was not different (CJA: 73(37) versus BETANOL: 63(41) (p = 0.35)). NOL sensitivity and specificity to detect a noxious stimulus under general anesthesia were similar in patients taking beta-blockers or not, and were better than those of heart rate and Bispectral index (AUC NOL 0.97, CI(0.92-1), versus AUC BIS 0.78, CI(0.64-0.89) and AUC HR 0.66, CI(0.5-0.8)). In conclusion, the NOL index is a reliable monitor to assess nociception in a population of patients under chronic beta-blocker therapy. Patients under such therapy achieve similar maximal NOL values over a 180 s period after a standardized noxious stimulus and the NOL variation over time, represented by the AUC is not significantly different from a cohort of non-beta-blocked patients. Whether the patient takes beta-blockers or not, sensitivity of the NOL index is greater than that seen for BIS index or heart rate to detect an experimental noxious stimulus under general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33398545/

Recently a propofol PK-PD model was developed for a broad population range. The aim of the study was to prospectively validate this model in children, adults, older subjects, and obese adults undergoing general anaesthesia.
The 25 subjects included in each of four groups were stratified by age and weight. Subjects received propofol through TCI with the Eleveld model, titrated to a bispectral index (BIS) of 40-60.

We aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of a dexmedetomidine-propofol combination and a ketamine-propofol combination during upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy.
The study commenced after receiving approval from the local ethics committee. Patients between 18 and 60 years in the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II groups were included. Patients who had severe organ disease, who had allergies to the study drugs, and who refused to participate were excluded. Cases were randomized into a dexmedetomidine-propofol group (Group D, n = 30) and a ketamine-propofol group (Group K, n = 30). Cardiac monitoring, peripheral oxygen saturation, and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring were performed. Group D received 1 mg/kg dexmedetomidine + 0.5 mg/kg propofol intravenous (IV) bolus, 0.5 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine + 0.5 mg/kg/h propfol infusion. Group K received 1 mg/kg ketamine + 0.125 mL/kg propofol iv bolus, 0.25 mg/kg/h ketamine + 0.125 mL/kg/h propfol infusion. Patients were followed up with a Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) of ≥4. Means, standard deviations, lowest and highest frequency values, and ratio values were used for descriptive statistics, and the SPSS 22.0 program was used for statistical analyses.
In Group K, recovery time and mean blood pressure (MBP) values were significantly shorter. Furthermore, coughing rate, pulse, and BIS values were higher than in Group D (P < .05). Although there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of endoscopic tolerance and endoscopist satisfaction, we observed that the dexmedetomidine group experienced more comfortable levels of sedation.
Dexmedetomidine-propofol and ketamine-propofol combinations may be suitable and safe for endoscopy sedation due to their different properties. It was observed that the dexmedetomidine-propfol combination was superior in terms of sedation depth and that the ketamine-propofol combination was superior in terms of early recovery. As a result, we suggest the dexmedetomidine-propofol combination for upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy sedation due to hemodynamic stability and minimal adverse effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33285707/

This comparative and randomized study included patients who had a burn size of 1563%, were aged 1870 years, were diagnosed with the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA I-II), and who underwent painful burn care procedures. Patients were intravenously administered either 1 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine (Group 1) or 0.03 mg/kg midazolam (Group 2) prior to the burn care procedure.

A significant decrease in SpO2 was observed in both groups at the 10th min during sedation, but the decline was higher in the midazolam group (p < 0.05). BIS measurements of the patients in both groups were significantly lower at 10 min. during sedation and at 15th and 60th mins during the procedure (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the group (p > 0.05). The RSS scales of both groups in during the sedation were higher in the 3rd, 5th and 10th mins than the baseline values (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the groups (p > 0.05). The RSS scales of groups in during the burn procedure were significantly higher at 15 th min than the 0 th values, while the RSS scales of both groups were significantly lower in the 45th and 60th mins (p < 0.05).
Results of this study indicate that dexmedetomidine causes hemodynamic alterations while midazolam causes respiratory depression.

Hence, it is speculated that acupuncture may have a sedative effect. However, existing studies employed acupuncture in combination with anesthetics, which makes determine acupuncture's role in producing sedation difficult. In this work, we investigated the sedative effect of acupuncture by using transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TAES) at bilateral Zusanli (ST36), Shenmen (HT7) and Sanyinjiao (SP6). Using a cross-over design, 2 separate sessions, that are, the resting and TAES sessions, were conducted for each subject. The sedative effect was quantified by using the bispectral index (BIS). The difference in brain activities between resting and TAES sessions was investigated by analyzing the simultaneously recorded EEG signals. Our results showed that a statistically significant difference in BIS values existed between resting and TAES sessions, which suggested that TAES alone was capable of inducing observable sedation. Using power spectrum analysis, we showed that TAES-induced sedation was accompanied by a reduction in alpha band power and an increment in delta band power. Permutation entropy was lower during the TAES session, which suggested that TAES reduced the complexity of the EEG signal. Moreover, a significant reduction in the global strength of brain functional connections was observed during TAES. These findings suggest that TAES alone can induce observable sedative effects, and this sedation effect is accompanied by changes in brain activities that have shown to be correlated with consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33256427/

The current analysis aimed to identify whether bispectral index (BIS) variations reliably reflect the actual depth of general anesthesia during presence of different types of epileptiform patterns (EPs) in EEGs during induction of general anesthesia.
Sixty patients receiving either VIGA with sevoflurane using increasing concentrations (group VIMA) or vital capacity (group VCRII) technique or intravenous single dose of propofol (group PROP) were included. Monitoring included facial electromyography (fEMG), fraction of inspired sevoflurane (FiAA), fraction of expired sevoflurane (FeAA), minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane, BIS, standard EEG, and hemodynamic parameters.
In the PROP group no EPs were observed. During different stages of VIGA with sevoflurane in the VIMA and VCRII groups, presence of polyspikes and rhythmic polyspikes in patients' EEGs resulted in artifactual BIS values indicating a false awareness/wakefulness from anesthesia, despite no concomitant change of FiAA, FeAA, and MAC of sevoflurane. Periodic epileptiform discharges did not result in aberrant BIS values.
Our results suggest that raw EEG correlate it with values of BIS, FiAA, FeAA, and MAC of sevoflurane during VIGA.

The mechanism of these movements is not known, and its relationship to depth of anesthesia monitoring is unclear. We have explored the effect of involuntary muscle movement on the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model for the GABAA receptor agonist ABP-700 and its effects on the Bispectral Index (BIS) as well as the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scores.
Observations from 350 individuals (220 men, 130 women) were analyzed, comprising 6,312 ABP-700 concentrations, 5,658 ABP-700 metabolite (CPM-acid) concentrations, 25,745 filtered BIS values, and 6,249 MOAA/S scores, and a recirculatory model developed. Various subject covariates and pretreatment with an opioid or a benzodiazepine were explored as covariates. Relationships between BIS and MOAA/S models and involuntary muscle movements were examined.
The final model shows that the pharmacokinetics of ABP-700 are characterized by small compartmental volumes and rapid clearance. The BIS model incorporates an effect-site for BIS suppression and a secondary excitatory/disinhibitory effect-site associated with a risk of involuntary muscle movements. The secondary effect-site has a threshold that decreases with age. The MOAA/S model did not show excitatory effects.
The GABAA receptor agonist ABP-700 shows the expected suppressive effects for BIS and MOAA/S, but also disinhibitory effects for BIS associated with involuntary muscle movements and reduced by pretreatment.

Therefore, the ability of PACU to accommodate postoperative patients is crucial. Optimizing extubation management may speed up the turnover of PACU beds. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of remifentanil, which is used during analepsia, on the length of PACU stay in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer.
In this prospective trial, we recruited a total of 99 patients, who were scheduled for laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer. At the end of the surgery, all patients were immediately transferred to the PACU and continued mechanical ventilation. Upon PACU admission, sputum aspiration was routinely performed. If the hemodynamic parameters fluctuated >30% of the baseline level, or patients moved unconsciously without reaching the criteria of extubation, a bolus injection of either 1 μg/kg remifentanil (Rem group, n=51) or propofol 1.0 mg/kg (Pro group, n=48) was randomly administered. The primary outcome was the duration of PACU stay. The secondary outcomes included time to respiratory breath recovery and time to extubation, along with bispectral index (BIS) values and hemodynamic status after remifentanil or propofol intervention. Times of repeated intervention, rescue administration of vasoactive drugs, and the incidence of adverse events were recorded. Visual analog scale and satisfaction scores at the time of PACU discharge were also evaluated.
The duration of PACU stay was shorter in the Rem group than in the Pro group [49 (46.47-51.06 minutes) vs. 62 minutes (60.75-69.29 minutes), P<0.0001]. Compared with the Pro group, the time to spontaneous breathing recovery, the time to extubation, and the incidence of hypoxemia after extubation were reduced in the Rem group (P<0.0001, P<0.0001, P=0.03, respectively). After anesthetic administration, the BIS value decreased less in the Rem group (P<0.0001); blood pressure and heart rate (HR) declined, but were comparable in both groups.

33027221,State entropy and burst suppression ratio can show contradictory information: A retrospective study.,European journal of anaesthesiology,2020,"Georgii MT, Pilge S, Schneider G, Kreuzer M","Burst suppression is a characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern that reflects very deep levels of general anaesthesia and may correlate with increased risk of adverse outcomes such as postoperative delirium. EEG-based monitors such as the Entropy Module estimate the level of anaesthesia (state entropy) and provide another index reflecting the occurrence of burst suppression, that is the ratio of burst and suppression (BSR). In the Entropy Module, state entropy and BSR are not interconnected, as they are in the bispectral index (BIS). Hence, state entropy and BSR may provide contradicting information regarding the level of anaesthesia.
We aimed to describe the frequency and characteristics of contradicting state entropy and BSR and to present possible strategies of how to act in these situations.
We based our analyses on state entropy and BSR trend recordings from 2551 patients older than 59 years that showed BSR was > 0 throughout their intervention under general anaesthesia. We determined the maximum state entropy when BSR was > 0, the minimum state entropy with BSR = 0 and the duration of high state entropy with BSR > 0. Further, we selected four exemplar patients to present details of how state entropy and BSR can contradict each other during anaesthesia.
We observed a wide range of state entropy values with BSR > 0. The median [IQR] of the maximum state entropy with BSR > 0 was 53 [45 to 61] and the median of the minimum state entropy without BSR was 21 [15 to 26]. Contradictory BSR and state entropy could persist over several minutes. The presented cases highlight these contradictory BSR and state entropy situations.
Our results illustrate contradictory state entropy and BSR indices that may be relevant for anaesthesia navigation. Longer-lasting episodes may lead to incorrect titration of the depth of the hypnotic component of anaesthesia. Hence, our results demonstrate the necessity to monitor and check the raw EEG or EEG parameters that are less processed than the commercially available indices to safely navigate anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33027221/

Overexposure to general anesthetics can have adverse effects such as inadequate emergence and postoperative delirium (PD). This study aimed to compare the effects of BIS-guided individualized anesthesia with standard general anesthesia on emergence and delirium after esophagectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data on 161 elderly patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer were retrospectively obtained from electronic medical records. We performed propensity score matching analysis between patients receiving individualized anesthesia (BIS value maintained at about 10 less than the value at LOC) and those receiving standard anesthesia (BIS value maintained at 40-60). In addition, we conducted univariate and multivariate logistic -analyses in the entire cohort. RESULTS Patients receiving individualized anesthesia had higher BIS values and a lower propofol requirement during surgery than those receiving standard general anesthesia (P<0.05). The overall incidences of inadequate emergence and PD were 37.9% and 18.0% (n=161), respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent risk factors for PD were organic brain disease (odds ratio [OR] 6.308; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.458-16.187) and inadequate emergence (OR 4.063; 95% CI 1.645-10.033). CONCLUSIONS BIS-guided individualized anesthesia (lighter) does not reduce inadequate emergence or PD compared with standard general anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing esophagectomy.

A Systematic Review.,Journal of pain and symptom management,2021,"Arantzamendi M, Belar A, Payne S, Rijpstra M, Preston N, Menten J, Van der Elst M, Radbruch L, Hasselaar J, Centeno C","Near the end of life when patients experience refractory symptoms, palliative sedation may be considered as a last treatment. Clinical guidelines have been developed, but they are mainly based on expert opinion or retrospective chart reviews. Therefore, evidence for the clinical aspects of palliative sedation is needed.
To explore clinical aspects of palliative sedation in recent prospective studies.
Systematic review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered at PROSPERO. PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched (January 2014-December 2019), combining sedation, palliative care, and prospective. Article quality was assessed.
Ten prospective articles were included, involving predominantly patients with cancer. Most frequently reported refractory symptoms were delirium (41%-83%), pain (25%-65%), and dyspnea (16%-59%). In some articles, psychological and existential distress were mentioned (16%-59%). Only a few articles specified the tools used to assess symptoms. Level of sedation assessment tools were the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, Ramsay Sedation Scale, Glasgow Coma Scale, and Bispectral Index monitoring. The palliative sedation practice shows an underlying need for proportionality in relation to symptom intensity. Midazolam was the main sedative used. Other reported medications were phenobarbital, promethazine, and anesthetic medication-propofol. The only study that reported level of patient's discomfort as a palliative sedation outcome showed a decrease in patient discomfort.
Assessment of refractory symptoms should include physical evaluation with standardized tools applied and interviews for psychological and existential evaluation by expert clinicians working in teams. Future research needs to evaluate the effectiveness of palliative sedation for refractory symptom relief.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32961218/

During DISE the patients are sedated to obtain a muscular relaxation of the upper airway which mimics the relaxation during natural sleep. Different sleep stages are intended to be simulated by drug induced sedation, and it is helpful to measure the depth of sedation. The BiSpectral Index® (BIS) is often used for this procedure. Besides the BIS, other means of sedation depth monitoring exist in anaesthesiology but have not yet been investigated with respect to DISE. Monitoring of the Cerebral State Index® (CSI) is one of these methods. The aim of the study was to compare the BIS and CSI for sedation depth monitoring during DISE.
Sixty patients underwent DISE monitored by the BIS and CSI in parallel. The BIS and CSI values were compared using the Bland-Altman analysis.
The BIS and CSI values differed during the course of sedation during DISE by a mean of - 6.07. At light sedation (BIS 60-80), lower values by 10 scale points of CSI compared with BIS were detectable. At deeper sedation levels (BIS 40-50), the CSI turned to present equal and even higher values compared with the BIS.
Sedation depth measurement during DISE can be performed by the BIS or CSI, but the differences should be interpreted carefully as comparable data for sleep stages in natural sleep are available only for BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32857320/

Intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative complication. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of intraoperative low BIS values and hypotension on postoperative mortality in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.
This retrospective study analyzed 1862 cases of general anesthesia. We collected the cumulative time of BIS values below 20 and 40 as well as electroencephalographic suppression and documented the incidences in which these states were maintained for at least 5 min. Durations of intraoperative mean arterial pressures (MAP) less than 50 mmHg were also recorded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between suspected risk factors and postoperative mortality.
Ninety-day mortality and 180-day mortality were 1.5 and 3.2% respectively. The cumulative time in minutes for BIS values falling below 40 coupled with MAP falling below 50 mmHg was associated with 90-day mortality (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.53; P = .019).

In the present study, we assessed changes in PLE along with the level of consciousness during the induction of general anesthesia using propofol. PLE was compared with the bispectral index (BIS), which is currently the most commonly used index of consciousness.After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent, we enrolled 15 patients (8 men, 7 women; mean age: 37 ± 9 years; mean height: 168 ± 8 cm; mean weight; 68 ± 11 kg) undergoing nasal bone reduction. PLE and BIS sensors were attached simultaneously, and general anesthesia was induced via target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol. PLE and BIS scores were recorded when the calculated effect site concentration shown on the TCI pump was equal to the target concentrations of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, 3.4, and 3.5 μg/mL (and at each 0.1 μg/mL increase, thereafter). Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scores were also recorded until unconsciousness was achieved. Throughout the anesthesia period, all pairs of PLE and BIS data were collected using data acquisition software.The partial correlation coefficients between OAA/S scores and PLE, and between OAA/S scores and BIS were 0.778 (P < .001) and 0.846 (P < .001), respectively. Throughout the period of anesthesia, PLE and BIS exhibited a significant positive correlation. The partial correlation coefficient prior to the loss of consciousness was 0.838 (P < .001), and 0.669 (P < .001) following the loss of consciousness. Intra-class correlation between the 2 indices was 0.889 (P < .001) and 0.791 (P < .001) prior and following the loss of consciousness, respectively.PLE exhibited a strong and predictable correlation with both BIS and OAA/S scores.

Techniques that reduce anaesthetic drug dose requirements in children may thus enhance the safety of paediatric sedation or anaesthesia. Brainwave entrainment, notably in the form of auditory binaural beats, has been shown to have sedative effects in adults. We evaluated the influence of brainwave entrainment on propofol dose requirements for sedation in children.
We randomised 49 boys scheduled for sub-umbilical surgery under caudal blockade to an entrainment or a control group. Small differences in pitch were applied to each ear to create binaural beats, supplemented by synchronous visual stimuli, within the electroencephalographic frequency bands seen during relaxation and (rapid eye movement/non-rapid eye movement) sleep. After establishment of caudal block, propofol infusion was started at 5 mg kg
Mean propofol infusion rates were 3.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-3.6) mg kg
Brainwave entrainment effectively reduced the propofol infusion rates required for sedation in children undergoing surgery with regional anaesthesia. Further studies are needed to investigate the possibility of phasing out propofol infusions completely during longer surgical procedures and optimising the settings of brainwave stimulation.

The DISE procedure was performed on 48 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or snoring patients. The parameters simultaneously recorded on a single monitor are (1) the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol (through the target controlled infusion (TCI) pump monitor), (2) the endoscopic upper airway view, (3) the polygraphic pattern, and (4) the level of sedation (through the bispectral index (BIS) value).

Nighty-five patients with established OSA were recruited for this study from May 2017 to May 2019. DISE was performed in the operating room. Sedation was maintained with propofol using a target-controlled infusion system and the depth of sedation was monitored based on the bispectral index. The breathing routes, which included oral breathing, oronasal breathing, and nasal breathing, were detected using capnography. DISE findings were recorded using the VOTE (velum, oropharynx, base of tongue, and epiglottis) classification.
Patients with mouth breathing were associated with increased OSA severity, worse oximetric variables, and higher body mass index in comparison with those with other breathing routes. Mouth breathing was associated with a higher degree and higher prevalence of lateral pharyngeal wall collapse and tongue base collapse during DISE.
Mouth breathing was significantly associated with worse oxygen desaturation and increased degree of upper airway collapse. Therefore, patients with mouth breathing during propofol-based intravenous anesthesia should be carefully monitored.

The most important effect that increases bleeding is hemodynamic changes during surgery. Considering that osteotomy is the most challenging process in rhinoplasty, this study aimed to examine the hemodynamic changes during osteotomy and changes in the depth of anesthesia.
A total of 50 patients, aged 18 to 65 years with an ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) score of 1 and 2, who underwent osteotomy during rhinoplasty under general anesthesia, were examined retrospectively. After routine monitoring, the patients underwent general anesthesia induction and endotracheal intubation. Before the surgery, they received remifentanil 1 μg/kg as an intravenous bolus followed by 0.5 μg/(kg·min) as intravenous infusion until the end of the surgery. The hemodynamic parameters and depth of anesthesia [bispectral index (BIS) values] of the patients were examined before anesthesia, 10 minutes before osteotomy, during osteotomy, and 10 minutes after osteotomy.
A significant difference was found in heart rate (beats/min), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mm Hg), and BIS values of the patients measured before, during, and after osteotomy (P < 0.001). The heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and BIS values were significantly higher during osteotomy. Until the 10th minute after osteotomy, all 4 parameters nearly reached the values measured before osteotomy.
Osteotomy directly affects hemodynamic parameters and depth of anesthesia. Hence, it is of utmost importance that the analgesic need and depth of anesthesia are adequately monitored and adjusted during osteotomy.

This retrospective study investigated the differences in the depth of anesthesia through EEG analysis between propofol- and thiopental-induced anesthesia. We reviewed data of 42 patients undergoing cesarean section who received either thiopental (5 mg/kg) or propofol (2 mg/kg). EEG data were extracted from the bispectral index (BIS) monitor, and 10-second segments were selected from the following sections: 1) Stage I, BIS below 60 after induction; 2) Stage II, after intubation completion; 3) Stage III, end-tidal sevoflurane above 0 vol%. The risk of awareness was represented by the BIS and entropy measures. In Stage III, the thiopental group (n = 20) showed significantly higher BIS value than the propofol group (n = 22) (67.9 [18.66] vs 44.5 [20.63], respectively, p = 0.002). The thiopental group had decreased slow-delta oscillations and increased beta-oscillations as compared to the propofol group in Stages II and III (p < 0.05). BIS, spectral entropy, and Renyi permutation entropy were also higher in the thiopental group at Stages II and III (p < 0.05).

This study assessed the effects of lidocaine treatment on sevoflurane consumption and postoperative consciousness disorders in children undergoing major spine surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients were randomly divided into 2 treatment groups: lidocaine and placebo (control). The lidocaine group received lidocaine as a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg over 30 min, followed by a continuous infusion at 1 mg/kg/h to 6 h after surgery. The following data were assessed: end-tidal sevoflurane concentration required to maintain a bispectral index BIS between 40 and 60, intraoperative blood pressure, heart rate, demand for fentanyl, and consciousness level assessed after surgery using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Any treatment-related adverse events were recorded. RESULTS Compared to the control group, lidocaine treatment reduced by 15% the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration required to maintain the intraoperative hemodynamic stability and appropriate level of anesthesia (P=0.0003). There were no intergroup differences in total dose of fentanyl used, average mean arterial pressure, or heart rate measured intraoperatively. The postoperative level of patient consciousness did not differ during the first 6 h between groups. After 9 h, more patients in the control group were still sleepy (P=0.032), and there were fewer perioperative complications in the lidocaine group.

VNS is effective in many cases, but few patients achieve complete elimination of seizures. Furthermore, VNS can cause respiratory complications, such as obstructive sleep apnea. This report describes the successful anesthetic management of a 28-year-old woman with a VNS device who underwent dental treatment under general anesthesia. She was morbidly obese and had undergone placement of a VNS device secondary to drug-resistant epilepsy 2 years prior but continued to experience daily epileptic seizures. Because of concerns about the risk of perioperative epileptic seizures and apneic events, use of the dedicated VNS device magnet was planned if such complications occurred. Total intravenous anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil and a bispectral index sensor was used to help monitor brain wave activity for evidence of seizures along with the depth of anesthesia. Postoperatively, the patient received positional therapy and supplemental oxygen while being closely monitored in recovery. The anesthetic course was completed uneventfully without need of the VNS magnet. A thorough understanding of the mechanics of a VNS device, including proper use of the VNS magnet, is critical for an anesthesiologist during the perioperative period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32191509/

The compound is being developed for sedation induction and maintenance during anesthesia. It was approved for procedural anesthesia in December 2019 by the National Medical Products Administration of China. Previous studies have reported on remimazolam's effects on consciousness and cognition. Although the time to full psychomotor recovery after remimazolam-mediated sedation is critical for decisions regarding hospital discharge, relevant clinical evidence is still lacking. This study investigated the residual psychomotor effects of remimazolam and their recovery from sedating treatment in 2 simulated clinical settings: (1) single-dose administration for sedation initiation; and (2) constant rate infusion for sedation maintenance.
A single-ascending-dose, parallel-group, midazolam-controlled study and a 2-way crossover study evaluating the reversal effect of flumazenil versus placebo after a 2-h constant rate infusion were conducted with HR-7056 in 87 Chinese healthy volunteers; the studies used a double-blind, randomized trial design. A battery of psychomotor tests was administered before dosing and several times postdose over 4-6 h. Pharmacokinetic, sedation, and safety assessments were performed throughout the studies.
After bolus infusion, the Bispectral Index score decreased in a concentration-dependent manner with HR-7056, accompanied by a sharp drop of Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score. The recovery of consciousness was much faster with HR-7056 than with midazolam. During the constant rate infusion, the Bispectral Index score was maintained between 40 and 60 with an average plasma remimazolam concentration of ~1000 ng/mL. Subjects' performance in saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movement, body sway, test of choice reaction time, and word recall was significantly impaired after single-dose midazolam and after constant rate infusion of remimazolam. The end-of-infusion injection of flumazenil shortened the median time to full alertness to 3.5 min and effectively reversed psychomotor and cardiovascular dysfunction.
The study results showed quicker psychomotor recovery from sedation in the remimazolam-treated group. The moderate and short-lasting residual effect of remimazolam after 2-h conscious sedation proposes a need for psychomotor assessment(s) before hospital discharge.

We hypothesized that weaning of the inspired sevoflurane during the final 15 minutes of surgery would eliminate differences in airway reflex recovery between these agents.
After obtaining IRB approval and informed consent, 40 patients undergoing elective surgery (≥1-hour) randomly received desflurane or sevoflurane. Patients swallowed 20 mL of water without drooling or coughing, and then received sedation and PONV pre-medication. Anesthesia was induced using propofol and fentanyl and maintained with desflurane or sevoflurane through a laryngeal mask airway maintaining a bispectral index of 45-50 and 50-60 during the final 15 minutes before surgery end. Cardiorespiratory variables and age-adjusted minimal alveolar concentration were recorded. The duration between anesthetic discontinuation and first appropriate response to command was measured; the laryngeal mask airway was removed. Two minutes after responding to command, patients were positioned semi-upright and attempted to swallow water. If successful swallowing was not achieved, the test was repeated every 4 minutes after each failure until successful swallowing was achieved.
Average anesthetic concentration and bispectral index was similar in patients receiving desflurane vs sevoflurane. Response times after discontinuation of anesthetics were similar. There were no differences in the recovery of swallowing ability between desflurane and sevoflurane groups.

For evaluation of the time delay, we replayed relevant EEG episodes to the qCON to simulate sudden changes between the states (i) awake/sedation, (ii) adequate anesthesia, or (iii) suppression. We also replayed EEG from 40 patients during LOR and ROR to evaluate the qCON's ability to separate responsiveness from unresponsiveness. The time delays depended on the type of transition. The delays for the important transition between awake/sedation and adequate anesthesia were 21(5) s from awake/sedation to adequate anesthesia and 26(5) s in the other direction. The performance of the qCON to separate responsiveness from unresponsiveness depended on signal quality, the investigation window, i.e. ± 30 s or ± 60 s around LOR/ROR, and the specific transition being tested. AUC was 0.63-0.90 for LOR and 0.61-0.79 for ROR. Time delay and performance during state transitions of the qCON were similar to other monitoring systems such as bispectral index.

DISE has never been compared with zolpidem-induced sleep endoscopy. We hypothesized that propofol at recommended sedation levels does not influence upper airway collapsibility nor the frequency of multilevel pharyngeal collapse as compared with zolpidem-induced sleep.
Twenty-one patients with obstructive sleep apnea underwent polysomnography and sleep endoscopy during zolpidem-induced sleep and during DISE with propofol. A propofol target-controlled infusion was titrated to achieve a bispectral index between 50 and 70. Airway collapsibility was estimated and compared in both conditions by peak inspiratory flow and the magnitude of negative effort dependence. Respiratory drive was estimated by the difference between end-expiratory and peak-negative inspiratory pharyngeal pressure (driving pressure). Site and configuration of pharyngeal collapse during zolpidem-induced sleep and DISE with propofol were compared.
The frequency of multilevel collapse during zolpidem-induced sleep was similar to that observed during DISE with propofol (72% vs 86%, respectively; difference: 14%; 95% confidence interval: -12% to 40%; P = .453).

This dose-response analysis of 4 phase 2-3 studies evaluated covariates that may impact the pharmacodynamic profile (based on theoretical pharmacokinetic principles) and require dose adjustments in subpopulations, particularly elderly, and if remimazolam has cumulative properties. Covariates affecting the time to loss of consciousness and time to extubation were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Factors affecting steady-state infusion rate required to produce adequate sedation were evaluated using linear regression. Variability in time to loss of consciousness was explained by induction dose, age, body mass index, and time from initiation of opioids to initiation of remimazolam. The steady-state infusion rate producing adequate sedation was higher in European than Japanese subjects due to differences in study design.

Other statistically significant covariates (American Society of Anesthesiologists class 2, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and sex) resulted in small (≤14%), non-clinically relevant differences. Factors affecting time to extubation included the last infusion rate (ie, tapering), the bispectral index score at the end of infusion, and sex. The time to extubation after remimazolam did not increase with increased cumulative dose of remimazolam or duration of surgery.

In this single-center, patient-and-evaluator-blinded, two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled, superiority study, 90 patients having noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the control group, anesthesia management was performed manually while in the closed-loop group, the titration of anesthesia, analgesia, fluids, and ventilation was performed by three independent controllers. The primary outcome was a change in a cognition score (the 30-item Montreal Cognitive Assessment) from preoperative values to those measures 1 week postsurgery. Secondary outcomes included a battery of neurocognitive tests completed at both 1 week and 3 months postsurgery as well as 30-day postsurgical outcomes.
Forty-three controls and 44 closed-loop patients were assessed for the primary outcome. There was a difference in the cognition score compared to baseline in the control group versus the closed-loop group 1 week postsurgery (-1 [-2 to 0] vs. 0 [-1 to 1]; difference 1 [95% CI, 0 to 3], P = 0.033). Patients in the closed-loop group spent less time during surgery with a Bispectral Index less than 40, had less end-tidal hypocapnia, and had a lower fluid balance compared to the control group.
Automated anesthetic management using the combination of three controllers outperforms manual control and may have an impact on delayed neurocognitive recovery. However, given the study design, it is not possible to determine the relative contribution of each controller on the cognition score.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31939839/

The aim was to assess the ability of Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) to detect standard noxious stimulation during anesthesia at different opioid concentrations in comparison to hemodynamic and Bispectral Index parameters. Sixteen patients undergoing general anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. Standardized tetanic electrical stimulation was applied without any other concurrent stimuli, while different effect site concentrations of remifentanil were increased step-by-step (0.5, 1.5, 3.0, 5 and 7 ng/ml). For each tetanic stimulus, values of the different variables 60 s before and 120 s following the stimulus were analyzed. ANI values decreased significantly 120 s after the stimulus when compared to the mean ANI 60 s before the stimulus (P < 0.01). At lower remifentanil concentrations (0.5 ng/ml), all variables except electromyogram from the Bispectral Index significantly changed after the stimulus but in the higher concentrations (5.0 and 7.0 ng/ml) there was not a significant change. The other variables did not change significantly after the noxious stimulation. ANI was the only variable that positively correlated with the different remifentanil concentrations (R = 0.959, P = 0.01). Our study showed that there was a significant decrease in Analgesia Nociception Index after a tetanic stimulation while hemodynamic and BIS parameters did not change, suggesting that the Analgesia Nociception Index may perform better than traditional hemodynamic parameters at reflecting noxious stimulation. Analgesia Nociception Index significantly changed at lower, but not at higher, remifentanil concentrations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31916221/

We evaluated cerebral perfusion in patients with or without cardiovascular comorbidities (Hi-risk vs Lo-risk) during induction of general anesthesia and during hypotensive episodes.
Patients scheduled for neuroradiology procedure using standardized target-controlled Propofol-Remifentanil infusion were prospectively included. Monitoring included Transcranial Doppler (TCD) measuring mean blood velocity of the middle cerebral artery (Vm), Bispectral Index with burst suppression ratio (SR) and cerebral Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Hypotensive episodes were treated with a 10 µg bolus of Norepinephrine.
Eighty-one patients were included, 37 Hi-risk and 44 Lo-risk. During induction of anesthesia, MAP and Vm decreased in all patients, with greater changes observed in Hi-risk patients compared to Lo-risk patients (-34 [38-29]% vs -17 [25-8]%, P < .001 and -39 [45-29]% vs -28 [34-19]%, P < .01 respectively). In Hi-risk patients, the MAP-decrease correlated with the Vm-decrease (r = .48, P < .01), and was associated with more frequent occurrences of SR (21 vs 5 patients, P < .01 for Hi-risk vs Lo-risk). For the MAP-increase induced by norepinephrine, the Vm-increase was greater in Hi-risk than in Lo-risk patients (+15 [8-21]% vs +4 [1-11]%, P < .01). During induction and norepinephrine boluses, NIRS values did not follow acute changes of Vm.
Our results showed that Hi-risk patients had a higher decrease in MAP and Vm, and a higher occurrence of SR during induction of anesthesia than Lo-risk patients. Correction of MAP with norepinephrine increased Vm mainly in Hi-rik patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31883375/

This prospective, randomized study included 46 patients scheduled for knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia with sedation. The patients were randomized to receive sedation with dexmedetomidine (n = 15), propofol (n = 15), or midazolam (n = 16). Correlation between BIS and OAA/S was assessed during sedation in the three groups.
A linear correlation was observed between BIS and OAA/S, and there was no significant difference in BIS score between the groups during mild to moderate sedation status (OAA/S 3-5). During deep sedation (OAA/S 1-2), the BIS score in the midazolam group was significantly higher than that in the propofol and dexmedetomidine groups (74.4 ± 11.9 vs 67.7 ±  9.5 vs 62.6 ± 12.2).

This was a randomized phase I study conducted in two parts. Part I was a double-blind, placebo- and midazolam-controlled, SAD study among healthy Chinese participants with a remimazolam dose of 0.025-0.4 mg/kg. Part II was an open-label, midazolam-controlled, continuous infusion study. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring and Modified Observers Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (MOAA/S) score assessment were used to assess the PD properties.
The half-life range of remimazolam was from 34.1 ± 8.1 to 59.8 ± 20.5 min in the SAD study. The sedation function was initially observed at the dose of 0.05 mg/kg remimazolam. Doses of ≥ 0.075 mg/kg exerted a peak sedation effect within 1-2 min after injection, resulting in a deeper and more rapid sedation. In the 2 h continuous infusion, remimazolam showed a deeper sedation and more rapid recovery than midazolam. For general anesthesia, an induction dosage of 0.2 mg/kg/min and a maintenance dosage of 1 mg/kg/h can achieve a satisfactory efficacy effect.
Remimazolam was safe and well tolerated in healthy Chinese participants. Based on the phase I clinical study, we suggest that remimazolam besylate demonstrates greater sedation and quicker recovery from sedation than midazolam.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31873765/

This study aimed to determine whether components of language function could be measured under general anesthesia. In this study, the occurrence of mismatch negativity (MMN) was searched in evoked potentials for phonological sounds.
Five normal hearing, French native speaker, awake volunteers participated in evaluating the phonological task (4 females and 1 male). Eleven normal-hearing, French native speaker patients (6 left and 5 right hemisphere lesions) participated at the time of their tumor neurosurgery (3 females and 8 males). Repetitions of the standard syllable /pa/ with the insertion of 1 deviant /po/ were presented through earphones. The difference between averaged epochs of standards and deviants syllables determined the MMN. During surgery, total intravenous anesthesia was performed with propofol and synthetic opioid sufentanil. The bispectral index was targeted (40 to 60).
The MMN was found in all awake volunteers and validated by an N250 component. In the patient group, the electroencephalogram analysis was not possible in 4 of 11 patients because of anesthesia being too deep, burst suppression, or a high level of noise (>40 μV).

However, its effect on the depth of sedation and potential to provoke arousal by awakening patients during the maneuver has not been studied so far. This study investigated the effect of the MJTM on the depth of sedation during DISE.
Forty patients on whom the MJTM was performed during DISE were included. The effect of the maneuver was evaluated at the levels of the velum, lateral wall of the oropharynx, base of the tongue, and epiglottis. Obstruction was defined as the collapse of the upper airway exceeding 75%, and improvement with the MJTM was defined as the widening of the upper airway by more than 50% during the maneuver. A bolus injection of midazolam was used to induce sedation and control the depth of sedation (bispectral index value of 60 to 80).
Obstructions were present in the velum of all patients, lateral wall of the oropharynx of 13 patients, base of the tongue of 28 patients, and epiglottis of 6 patients.

Intraoperative awareness, whilst uncommon, may lead to serious psychological disturbance, and alternative methods to monitor the depth of anaesthesia may reduce the incidence of serious events. Bispectral index (BIS) is a numerical scale based on electrical activity in the brain. Using a BIS monitor to guide the dose of anaesthetic may have advantages over clinical signs or ETAG. This is an update of a review last published in 2014.
To assess the effectiveness of BIS to reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness and early recovery times from general anaesthesia in adults undergoing surgery.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science on 26 March 2019. We searched clinical trial registers and grey literature, and handsearched reference lists of included studies and related reviews.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which BIS was used to guide anaesthesia compared with standard practice which was either clinical signs or end-tidal anaesthetic gas (ETAG) to guide the anaesthetic dose. We included adult participants undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia regardless of whether included participants had a high risk of intraoperative awareness. We included only studies in which investigators aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BIS for its role in monitoring intraoperative depth of anaesthesia or potential improvements in early recovery times from anaesthesia.
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE.
We included 52 studies with 41,331 participants; two studies were quasi-randomized and the remaining studies were RCTs. All studies included participants undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. Three studies recruited only participants who were at high risk of intraoperative awareness, whilst two studies specifically recruited an unselected participant group. We analysed the data according to two comparison groups: BIS versus clinical signs; and BIS versus ETAG. Forty-eight studies used clinical signs as a comparison method, which included titration of anaesthesia according to criteria such as blood pressure or heart rate and, six studies used ETAG to guide anaesthesia. Whilst BIS target values differed between studies, all were within a range of values between 40 to 60.BIS versus clinical signsWe found low-certainty evidence that BIS-guided anaesthesia may reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness in a surgical population that were unselected or at high risk of awareness (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.60; I
Intraoperative awareness is infrequent and, despite identifying a large number of eligible studies, evidence for the effectiveness of using BIS to guide anaesthetic depth is imprecise. We found that BIS-guided anaesthesia compared to clinical signs may reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness and improve early recovery times in people undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia but we found no evidence of a difference between BIS-guided anaesthesia and ETAG-guided anaesthesia. We found six studies awaiting classification and two ongoing studies; inclusion of these studies in future updates may increase the certainty of the evidence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31557307/

Because current studies still have some flaws, further trials with new detecting approach, superior methodology and underlying aetiology are needed to unfasten the possible factors causing awareness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31527334/

We aimed to evaluate the effect of BIS monitoring on early cognitive performance among patients undergoing sedation for colonoscopy.
Randomized, controlled trial in a university hospital.
100 patients were randomized into two groups. In the monitored group (n = 50), the depth of anesthesia was monitored using the BIS, and BIS scores were maintained between 60 and 80. In the usual care group (n = 50), BIS monitoring was not performed. To determine the patients' baseline cognitive performance levels, the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Trieger dot test (TDT) and clock drawing test (CDT) were used. The patients' post-procedure cognitive performance levels were determined when they were classified as ready for discharge.
The total volume (mg) of propofol used [median (range) IQR] in the sedation procedure was lower in the monitored group [100 (50-200) 100-140] than in the usual care group [150 (75-200) 100-200] (P < 0.001). The discharge scores [mean (SD)] using MMSE and CDT were higher in the monitored group [26 (3) and 3 (1), respectively] than in the usual care group [23 (3) and 2 (1), respectively] (P = 0.002 and P = 0.002, respectively). The discharge scores using TDT [mean (SD)] were lower in the monitored group [11 (7)] than in the usual care group [15 (11)] (P = 0.033).
BIS monitoring among sedated patients was associated with lower propofol use and smaller decline in cognitive performance.

The depth of surgical anaesthesia was measured and confirmed with an EEG-derived technique, the Bispectral Index (BIS). The magnitude of the task-related BOLD response and BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia were determined. The fMRI data were assessed by three fMRI expert observers who rated each activation map for somatotopy and usefulness for radiological neurosurgical guidance. The mean magnitudes of the task-related BOLD response under a BIS measured depth of surgical general anaesthesia were 25% (tumour affected hemisphere) and 22% (tumour free hemisphere) of the respective awake values. BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia ranged from 7% to 83% compared to the awake state.

31490817,Effect of Different Concentrations of Propofol Used as a Sole Anesthetic on Pupillary Diameter: A Randomized Trial.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2020,"Sabourdin N, Meniolle F, Chemam S, Rigouzzo A, Hamza J, Louvet N, Constant I","Pupillometry monitoring under general anesthesia is based on the assumption that pupillary diameter variations reflect the adequacy of the provided analgesia to the intensity of the nociceptive surgical stimulus. The accurate interpretation of pupillometric data requires establishing clearly what the expected baseline unstimulated pupillary diameter at each specific level of hypnosis is. Opioids decrease pupillary diameter in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, the effects of hypnotic drugs on pupillary diameter are not well known. Our aim was to describe the potential relationship between propofol predicted effect-site concentrations (Cets) ranging from 1 to 3 µg/mL and pupillary diameter.
Patients were randomized to receive propofol by target-controlled infusion at a predicted Cet of 1, 2, or 3 µg/mL (groups P1, P2, and P3, respectively). Pupillary diameter measurements were performed after 10 minutes of steady-state propofol infusion at the randomized Cet. No stimulation was performed during the study. Heart rate and bispectral index (BIS) were continuously recorded.
Forty patients were included: (13, 14, and 13 in groups P1, P2, and P3, respectively). Mean pupillary diameter was 5.7 mm (1 mm) in group P1, 4.8 mm (1.3 mm) in group P2, and 3.3 mm (0.8 mm) in group P3. Propofol had a dose-dependent effect on pupillary diameter (linear regression R = 0.45, P < .001). Pupillary diameter was positively correlated with the BIS (Spearman r = 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54 to -0.87] P < .001).
From 1 to 3 µg/mL of predicted Cet, propofol has a dose-dependent effect on pupillary diameter. Within this concentrations range, there is a positive correlation between BIS and pupillary diameter. The subcortical effect of propofol on pupillary diameter is correlated to its effect on the cortex. Studies assessing pupillary diameter as a marker of the nociception-antinociception balance should be performed in patients with a standardized depth of hypnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31490817/

We aimed to evaluate the effect of deepening levels of sedation induced by propofol and how they compare to natural sleep.
Fifty consecutive neurologically normal patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy while sedated with propofol were included. Topographic EEG spectral maps and the bispectral index (BIS) values were obtained at four time points: wakefulness, mild sedation, deep sedation and recovery. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels.
Propofol induced increased delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and gamma (25-40 Hz) power throughout sedation. In addition, there was decreased alpha power (9-11.5 Hz) in the occipital area and increased global beta (12-25 Hz)/gamma (25-40 Hz) power during mild sedation. Deep sedation was associated with increased theta (4-7 Hz)/alpha (9-11.5 Hz)/beta (12-25 Hz) power, which was maximal frontally.
There are distinct changes associated with deepening levels of propofol induced sedation that distinguish it from natural sleep. This suggests that different mechanisms are involved in them and warrants further investigations to clarify the nature of these changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31434471/

However, a trial recently demonstrated impaired ventilatory drive and induction of apneas in sedated volunteers. The present study measured upper airway collapsibility during dexmedetomidine sedation and related it to propofol.
Twelve volunteers (seven female) entered this nonblinded, randomized crossover study. Upper airway collapsibility (pharyngeal critical pressure) was measured during low and moderate infusion rates of propofol or dexmedetomidine. A bolus dose was followed by low (0.5 μg · kg · h or 42 μg · kg · min) and moderate (1.5 μg · kg · h or 83 μg · kg · min) rates of infusion of dexmedetomidine and propofol, respectively.
Complete data sets were obtained from nine volunteers (median age [range], 46 [23 to 66] yr; body mass index, 25.4 [20.3 to 32.4] kg/m). The Bispectral Index score at time of pharyngeal critical pressure measurements was 74 ± 10 and 65 ± 13 (mean difference, 9; 95% CI, 3 to 16; P = 0.011) during low infusion rates versus 57 ± 16 and 39 ± 12 (mean difference, 18; 95% CI, 8 to 28; P = 0.003) during moderate infusion rates of dexmedetomidine and propofol, respectively. A difference in pharyngeal critical pressure during sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol could not be shown at either the low or moderate infusion rate. Median (interquartile range) pharyngeal critical pressure was -2.0 (less than -15 to 2.3) and 0.9 (less than -15 to 1.5) cm H2O (mean difference, 0.9; 95% CI, -4.7 to 3.1) during low infusion rates (P = 0. 595) versus 0.3 (-9.2 to 1.4) and -0.6 (-7.7 to 1.3) cm H2O (mean difference, 0.0; 95% CI, -2.1 to 2.1; P = 0.980) during moderate infusion of dexmedetomidine and propofol, respectively.

A 56-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with difficulty breathing after a blunt trauma to his chest to the emergency room and was diagnosed with dislocation of the first rib and tracheal laceration after a chest tomography (CT) study. Subcutaneous emphysema in neck area quickly worsened indicating continuous air leak. Emergent surgical repair was scheduled. General anesthesia with maintaining spontaneous ventilation was performed and a 5.5 mm endotracheal tube was placed under the guidance of flexible bronchoscopy. Depth of anesthesia was maintained to achieve a Bispectral Index Score of 40-60. Once the offending first rib was removed, a 7.5 mm endotracheal tube was inserted distal to the laceration site with the guidance of flexible bronchoscopy. Once confirmed location of the endotracheal tube, cisatracurium was administered intravenously and the patient was managed on mechanical ventilation with interval positive pressure ventilation. The operation was successful and he was transferred to the ICU intubated. He then received elective surgical repairs for sternum fracture, multiple rib fractures and hemopneumothorax under general anesthesia on day 5 after the first surgery and was extubated on postoperative day 7. The subsequent course was uneventful. Comprehensive rehabilitation was done for 2 weeks and he was discharged home on postoperative day 41.

However, during cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia, common symptoms of nociception such as tachycardia, hypertension, sweating, or movement have low sensitivity and specificity in the description of the patient nociception and hypnosis, in particular, detecting nociceptive stimuli. Better monitoring of the depth of analgesia during hypothermia under cardiopulmonary bypass will avoid underdosage or overdosage of analgesia, especially opioids. Induced hypothermia has a multifactorial effect on the level of analgesia and hypnosis. Thermoregulatory processes appear essential for the activation of analgesic mechanisms, ranging from a physiological strong negative affiliation between nerve conduction velocity and temperature, until significant repercussions on the pharmacological dynamics of the analgesic drugs, the latter decreasing the clearance rate with a subsequent increase in the effect-site concentrations. Under the hypothesis that deep hypothermia induces massive effects on the analgesia and hypnosis levels of the patient, we studied whether hypothermia effects were mirrored by several neuromonitoring indices: two hypnosis indices, consciousness index and bispectral index, and a novel nociception index designed to evaluate the analgesic depth. In this clinical trial, 39 patients were monitored during general anesthesia with coronary atherosclerosis cardiopathy who were elective for on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery under hypothermia. The changes and correlation between the consciousness index, bispectral index, and nociception index with respect to the temperature were compared in different timepoints at basic state, during cardiopulmonary bypass and after cardiopulmonary bypass. While the three neuromonitoring indices showed significant correlations with respect to the temperature, the nociception index and consciousness index showed the strongest sensitivities, indicating that these two indices could be an important means of intraoperative neuromonitoring during induced hypothermia under cardiopulmonary bypass.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31387454/

Propofol was titrated to increase the level of sedation with a continuous infusion of remifentanil at a rate of 0.05 μg/kg/min while maintaining spontaneous ventilation in 22 children with spastic CP, aged 3-18 years. The depth of sedation was assessed using the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) and the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (MOAAS) scale. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the cutoff BIS values for deep sedation, defined as a UMSS score of 3-4 and a MOAAS score of 0-1.
The BIS values significantly changed with the increase in the level of sedation across both the UMSS and MOAAS scores (P < 0.001). The BIS values correlated with the UMSS (r = -0.795, P < 0.001) and MOAAS (r = 0.815, P < 0.001) scores. The cutoff BIS value to detect adequate deep sedation in children with CP was 61.5 (UMSS score: sensitivity 0.860, specificity 0.814; MOAAS score: sensitivity 0.794, specificity 0.811).
The BIS value strongly correlates with the clinical sedation scales, such as the UMSS and MOAAS, during deep sedation in children with CP.

Vessel diameter was obtained each time, and internal carotid artery blood flow, the main outcome variable, was calculated. The authors recorded pulse contour estimated mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV) index, cardiac index, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), bispectral index, and ventilator settings. Results are medians (95% CI).
Internal carotid artery blood flow decreased upon anesthesia induction from 350 ml/min (273 to 410) to 213 ml/min (175 to 249; -37%, P < 0.001), and tended to decrease further with pneumoperitoneum (178 ml/min [127 to 208], -15%, P = 0.026). Tilt induced no further change (171 ml/min [134 to 205]). ETCO2 and bispectral index were unchanged after induction. MAP decreased with anesthesia, from 102 (91 to 108) to 72 (65 to 76) mmHg, and then remained unchanged (Pneumoperitoneum: 70 [63 to 75]; Tilt: 74 [66 to 78]).

In the present age-stratified, randomized, assessor-blinded study, using the ClearSight
Patients were divided into young (20-40 year), middle (41-70 year), and elderly (> 70 year) groups (n = 20, each group). General anesthesia was induced with remifentanil 0.3 μg/kg/min, followed by propofol (2.0, 1.5, and 1.2 mg/kg) or thiopental (5.0, 4.0, and 3.0 mg/kg) in the young, middle, and elderly groups, respectively. The primary outcome was the difference in the decrease in mean arterial blood pressure between patients receiving propofol and thiopental in each age group. The secondary outcomes included other hemodynamic parameters and minimal bispectral index values measured up to 10 min after tracheal intubation.
The decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was greater in patients receiving propofol than those receiving thiopental (- 45.4 vs - 26.6 mmHg and - 45.7 vs - 28.9 mmHg, P = 0.003 and 0.007, respectively), whereas no significant difference was observed in the young age group (P = 0.96).
Thiopental is a more suitable agent than propofol for avoiding hypotension during GA induction under remifentanil infusion in the middle and elderly patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31228006/

After obtaining ethical approval and written informed consent, we enrolled 51 patients undergoing liver resection under isoflurane based general anaesthesia using laryngeal mask airway in this prospective observational study. Data relating to SPI values were recorded every 30 s for the last 3 min of surgery (bispectral index < 60 at all times). Postoperative pain intensity was assessed using a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) every 10 min in the recovery room. The relationships between SPI with postoperative pain score and opioid requirement were analysed. A receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to evaluate the performance of SPI to predict NRS ≥ 5. SPI value was significantly associated with the highest pain score in the recovery room (r = 0.63, p < 0.001). An SPI value of 60, which showed the highest sensitivity and specificity, was defined post hoc as the cut-off for moderate-severe pain (NRS ≥ 5). When compared the patients who showed SPI value over 60 or not, there was significant difference in the amount of fentanyl consumption during postoperative 48 h (1093 ± 406 µg vs. 766 ± 369 µg, p = 0.014; SPI ≥ 60 vs. SPI < 60).

It has been widely used for monitoring depth of anesthesia (DoA). In this study, we propose a method that combines multiple EEG-based features with artificial neural network (ANN) to assess the DoA. Multiple EEG-based features can express the states of the brain more comprehensively during anesthesia. First, four parameters including permutation entropy, 95% spectral edge frequency, BetaRatio and SynchFastSlow were extracted from the EEG signal. Then, the four parameters were set as the inputs to an ANN which used bispectral index (BIS) as the reference output. 16 patient datasets during propofol anesthesia were used to evaluate this method. The results indicated that the accuracies of detecting each state were 86.4% (awake), 73.6% (light anesthesia), 84.4% (general anesthesia), and 14% (deep anesthesia). The correlation coefficient between BIS and the index of this method was 0.892 ( p < 0.001 ). The results showed that the proposed method could well distinguish between awake and other anesthesia states. This method is promising and feasible for a monitoring system to assess the DoA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159263/

Studies comparing different BIS levels during ECT.
The primary outcome measured the electrical seizure duration. Secondary outcomes measured the clinical seizure duration, and correlation between pre-ictal BIS level and awakening time. Difference in means (MD) was used for effect size.
Among 38 eligible studies, 7 were analyzed including 260 patients, aged from 16 to 80 years old, benefiting from 1283 ECT sessions. Higher BIS levels were associated with longer electric seizures duration (correlation 0.61, 95% CI [0.39-0.75], 7 studies) and longer motor seizures duration (correlation 0.72, 95% CI [0.29-0.91], 6 studies).

31124327,Comparative Analysis of Phase Lag Entropy and Bispectral Index as Anesthetic Depth Indicators in Patients Undergoing Thyroid Surgery with Nerve Integrity Monitoring.,Journal of Korean medical science,2019,"Seo KH, Kim KM, Lee SK, John H, Lee J","Most depth of anesthesia (DOA) monitors rely on the temporal characteristics of a single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) and cannot provide spatial or connectivity information. Phase lag entropy (PLE) reflects DOA by calculating diverse connectivity from temporal patterns of phase relationships. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of PLE and bispectral index (BIS) monitors for assessing DOA during anesthesia induction, nerve integrity monitoring (NIM), and anesthesia emergence.
Thirty-five patients undergoing elective thyroid surgery with recurrent laryngeal nerve NIM received propofol and remifentanil via target-controlled infusion. After applying PLE and BIS monitors, propofol infusion was initiated at a calculated effect site concentration (Ce) of 2 μg/mL and then increased in 1-μg/mL Ce increments. After propofol Ce reached 5 μ/mL, a remifentanil infusion was begun, and anesthesia induction was considered complete. During NIM, PLE and BIS values were compared at a specific time points from platysma muscle exposure to subcutaneous tissue closure. PLE and BIS values were recorded continuously from preanesthetic state to full recovery of orientation; bias and limits of agreement between monitors were calculated.
PLE and BIS values decreased progressively with increasing propofol Ce during anesthetic induction and increased by stages during emergence. The prediction probabilities of PLE and BIS for detecting propofol Ce changes were 0.750 and 0.756, respectively, during induction and 0.749 and 0.746, respectively, during emergence. No aberrant PLE or BIS values occurred during NIM. Correlation coefficients for BIS and PLE were 0.98 and 0.92 during induction and emergence, respectively. PLE values were significantly higher than BIS values at full recovery of orientation. Estimated bias between monitors was -4.16 ± 8.7, and 95% limits of agreement were -21.21 to 12.89.
PLE is a reasonable alternative to BIS for evaluating consciousness and DOA during general anesthesia and during NIM.

Neurophysiological variability indicates compromised regulation and organization of neural networks. Based on theories of neuronal integrity changes that accompany aging, we assessed the relative contribution of: 1) premorbid cognitive reserve, 2) current brain integrity (gray and white matter markers of neurodegenerative disease), and 3) current cognition (specifically domains of processing speed/working memory, episodic memory, and motor function) on intraoperative neurophysiological variability as measured from a common intraoperative tool, the Bispectral Index Monitor (BIS).
This sub-study included participants from a parent study of non-demented older adults electing unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) with the same surgeon and anesthesia protocol, who also completed a preoperative neuropsychological assessment and preoperative 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Left frontal two-channel derived EEG via the BIS was acquired preoperatively (un-medicated and awake) and continuously intraoperatively with time from tourniquet up to tourniquet down. Data analyses used correlation and regression modeling.
Fifty-four participants met inclusion criteria for the sub-study. The mean (SD) age was 69.5 (7.4) years, 54% were male, 89% were white, and the mean (SD) American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 2.76 (0.47). We confirmed that brain integrity positively and significantly associated with each of the cognitive domains of interest. EEG intra-individual variability (squared deviation from the mean BIS value between tourniquet up and down) was significantly correlated with cognitive reserve (r = -.40, p = .003), brain integrity (r = -.37, p = .007), and a domain of processing speed/working memory (termed cognitive efficiency; r = -.31, p = .021). Hierarchical regression models that sequentially included age, propofol bolus dose, cognitive reserve, brain integrity, and cognitive efficiency found that intraoperative propofol bolus dose (p = .001), premorbid cognitive reserve (p = .008), and current brain integrity (p = .004) explained a significant portion of intraoperative intra-individual variability from the BIS monitor.
Older adults with higher premorbid reserve and less brain disease were more stable intraoperatively on a depth of anesthesia monitor. Researchers need to replicate findings within larger cohorts and other surgery types.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31120896/

We compared the performance of phase lag entropy with the bispectral index™ in 30 patients scheduled for elective surgery. We initiated a target-controlled infusion of propofol using the Schnider model, and assessed sedation levels using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale every 30 s with each stepwise increase in the effect-site propofol concentration. Phase lag entropy and bispectral index values were recorded. The correlation coefficient and prediction probability between phase lag entropy or bispectral index and the sedation level or effect-site propofol concentration were analysed. We calculated baseline variabilities of phase lag entropy and bispectral index. In addition, we applied a non-linear mixed-effects model to obtain the pharmacodynamic relationships among the effect-site propofol concentration, phase lag entropy or bispectral index and sedation level. As sedation increased, phase lag entropy and bispectral index both decreased. The prediction probability values of phase lag entropy and bispectral index for sedation levels were 0.697 and 0.700 (p = 0.261) and for the effect-site concentration of propofol were 0.646 and 0.630 (p = 0.091), respectively.

Although VATS results in reduced postoperative pain compared with thoracotomy, it is still painful. Serratus plane block (SPB) is a novel technique that provides lateral chest wall analgesia by blocking the lateral branch of the intercostal nerve.
We conducted a prospective study in 50 patients, aged 20 to 75 years, undergoing three-port VATS lobectomy. Group G (n = 25) received conventional general anesthesia and Group S (n = 25) received SPB before induction of general anesthesia. In Group S, 20 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine was injected between the serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi muscles. During surgery, anesthesia was maintained by adjusting the propofol dose to maintain a bispectral index of 40 to 60 and the remifentanil dose to maintain blood pressure and heart rate within 70 to 130% of baseline.
Intraoperative remifentanil consumption was significantly lower in Group S compared to that in Group G (519.9 μg vs 1047.7 μg, P < .001). Moreover, emergence time was significantly shorter in Group S compared to Group G (10.8 minutes vs 14.9 minutes, P = .01).

However, the effects of regional anesthesia on nociceptive levels during surgery under general anesthesia have not been quantitatively evaluated. To reveal the effects of thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) on nociceptive levels after skin incision during general anesthesia, we performed a retrospective cohort study in patients without serious preoperative conditions or comorbidities undergoing elective video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Nociceptive levels during general anesthesia were calculated using our previously determined Nociceptive Response (NR) equation, which utilizes common hemodynamic parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data on 77 adult patients who underwent VATS from May 2018 to August 2018 were retrospectively obtained from our institutional database. We then performed propensity score matching between patients who received thoracic PVB (PVB group: n=29) and those who did not (Control group: n=48). The averaged values of systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), perfusion index (PI), bispectral index (BIS), and NR from 10 to 5 minutes before skin incision (T0), 5 to 10 minutes (T1), 10 to 15 minutes (T2), 15 to 20 minutes (T3), and 20 to 25 minutes after skin incision (T4), were calculated. RESULTS Twenty-four propensity score-matched patients in each group were analyzed. Mean NR values at T1 and T2 in the PVB group were significantly lower than those in the Control group.

Seventy-three subjects (11 years, range 5-18) were included and randomly assigned to two groups according to the anesthetic agent. Anesthesia was performed by target-controlled infusion of propofol (group P) or by sevoflurane inhalation (group S). Steady-state periods were performed at a fixed randomized concentration between 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 μg.ml
Under propofol, BIS decreased monotonically and EEG slowed down as concentrations increased from 2 to 6 μg.ml
Under deep anesthesia, the BIS and electroencephalographic profiles differ between propofol and sevoflurane. For high concentrations of sevoflurane, an elevated BIS value may be interpreted as a sign of epileptoid patterns or EEG fast oscillations rather than an insufficient depth of hypnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30614153/

Patients admitted to the ICU who require mechanical ventilation are surrounded by an ambient noise level ranging from 60 to 90 dB, well above the 40 dB recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
This was a randomized crossover clinical trial. Group A: sound isolation (1 h) followed by music (1 h); Group B: music (1 h) followed by sound isolation (1 h). Interventions were administered using noise-cancelling headphones. The hypnotic level, the level of sedation and the alteration of behaviour because of pain was assessed using the bispectral index (BIS), the Ramsay scale and the behavioural pain scale (BPS), respectively. Statistical analysis of correlated data was performed using a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model.
Of 130 patients assessed for eligibility, 82 were randomized to Groups A (n = 40) or B (n = 42). Mean age was 69 years (SD = 14), and 77·3% were men. A decrease of 4-5 points out of 100 during sound isolation and music therapy was recorded in BIS in both groups; the differences were not statistically significant compared with baseline scores. Likewise, no differences were observed in the scores obtained in the Ramsay scale and BPS.
Sound isolation and music intervention did not modify the comfort or physiological variables of mechanically ventilated critical patients from their respective baseline values.
Music and sound isolation are potential strategies that could be used in nursing care to provide comfort to critical patients. Further studies should be undertaken to define the role of these new approaches and determine which groups of patients can benefit most from music or sound isolation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30592127/

We explored the nature of heart rate (HR) changes as they occur during natural sleep versus those occurring during dexmedetomidine sedation.
The present study included 30 patients who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery with spinal anesthesia. To assess HR and sedation, a pulse oximeter and bispectral index (BIS) monitor were attached to the patient in the ward and the operating room. After measuring HR and BIS at baseline, as the patients slept and once their BIS was below 70, HR and BIS were measured at 5-minute intervals during sleep. Baseline HR and BIS were also recorded before spinal anesthesia measured at 5-minute intervals after dexmedetomidine injection.
During natural sleep, HR changes ranged from 2 to 19 beats/min (13.4 ± 4.4 beats/min), while in dexmedetomidine sedation, HR ranged from 9 to 40 beats/min (25.4 ± 8.5 beats/min). Decrease in HR was significantly correlated between natural sleep and dexmedetomidine sedation (R2 = 0.41, P < 0.001). The lowest HR was reached in 66 min during natural sleep (59 beats/min) and in 13 min with dexmedetomidine sedation (55 beats/min). The time to reach minimum HR was significantly different (P < 0.001), but there was no difference in the lowest HR obtained (P = 0.09).
There was a correlation between the change in HR during natural sleep and dexmedetomidine sedation. The bradycardia that occurs when using dexmedetomidine may be a normal physiologic change, that can be monitored rather than corrected.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30481949/

Avoiding conditions of over- and under-sedation is a challenge in a neonatal intensive care setting. Drug administration could be optimized by the concomitant use of objective methods to assess the level of sedation.
We aimed to look at the ability of different methods (Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale, amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram, and Bispectral Index), and their combination, in detecting different level of sedation.
Twenty-seven neonates among whom 17 were receiving sedatives with or without opiate analgesics were monitored using the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale, the amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram, and the Bispectral Index. According to the expert opinion of two trained neonatologists, patients were categorized into three groups: no, light, and deep sedation. Four hours of simultaneous assessment of the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale scores, Burdjalov scores (to summarize the amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram trace), and Bispectral Index values were considered for the comparative analysis across these groups.
All three methods could differentiate patients who were not sedated from those who were deeply sedated: median score 12 and 9, respectively, (95% CI of difference = 1.99-5.99, P = 0.001) for the amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram Burdjalov score; median 1 and -5, respectively, (95% CI of difference = 2.99-8.00, P = 0.001) for the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale; and median 48 and 37, respectively, (CI of difference = 1.77-22.00, P = 0.043) for the Bispectral Index. However none of them, used alone, was able to differentiate light and deep sedation: median score 10 and 9, respectively, for the amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram Burdjalov score; median -2 and -5, respectively, for the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale; and median 48 and 37, respectively, for the Bispectral Index. Only the amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram and the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale were able to differentiate between the conditions of no sedation and light sedation. Also, according to the area under the curves values, the combination of the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale with the Burdjalov score derived from the amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram showed the best accuracy in differentiating light and deep sedation.
While none of the three methods alone was able to precisely differentiate between different levels of sedation, we suggest that using a combination of amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram and Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale can be useful to distinguish between light and deep sedation in neonatal patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30375123/

With increased focus on detecting the anesthesia states of patients in the course of surgery, more attention has been paid to analyzing the power spectra and entropy measures of EEG signal during anesthesia. In this paper, by using the relative power of EEG frequency bands and the EEG entropy measures, a new method for detecting the depth of anesthesia states has been presented based on the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers. EEG signals were recorded from 20 patients before, during and after general anesthesia in the operating room at a sampling rate of 200 Hz. Then, 12 features were extracted from each EEG segment, 10 s in length, which are used for anesthesia state monitoring. No significant difference was observed (p > 0.05) between these features and the bispectral index (BIS), which is the commonly used measure of anesthetic effect. The used LS-SVM classifier based method is able to identify the anesthesia states with an accuracy of 80% with reference to the BIS index. Since the underlying equation of the utilized LS-SVM is linear, the computational time of the algorithm is not significant and therefore it can be used for online application in operation rooms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30338496/

Thirty-six patients undergoing short lasting sedation following cardiac surgery were included to receive propofol to maintain a BIS between 40 and 60. Robustness of control for all groups was analysed using prediction error and spectrographic analysis.
Although similar time courses of measured BIS were obtained in all groups, a higher median propofol effect-site concentration (CePROP) was required in the HUMAN group compared to the BAYES and EPSAC groups. The time course analysis of the remifentanil effect-site concentration (CeREMI) revealed a significant increase in CeREMI in the EPSAC group compared to BAYES and HUMAN during the case. Although similar bias and divergence in control was found in all groups, larger control inaccuracy was observed in HUMAN versus EPSAC and BAYES. Spectrographic analysis of the system behavior shows that BAYES covers the largest spectrum of frequencies, followed by EPSAC and HUMAN.
Both computer-based control systems are feasible to be used during ICU sedation with overall tighter control than HUMAN and even with lower required CePROP. EPSAC control required higher CeREMI than BAYES or HUMAN to maintain stable control. Clinical trial number: NCT00735631.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30311073/

The objective of the study was to evaluate the utility of BIS in the assessment of the intensity of hypercapnic encephalopathy in ECOPD patients.
A total of ten ECOPD patients were included, and the level of brain activity was assessed using BIS and different scales: Glasgow Coma Scale, Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS), and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. The evaluation was performed both in the acute phase and 3 months after discharge.
BIS was recorded for a total of about 600 minutes. During ECOPD, BIS values ranged from 58.8 (95% CI: 48.6-69) for RSS score of 4 to 92.2 (95% CI: 90.1-94.3) for RSS score of 2.

The impact of remifentanil in this relationship is poorly quantified in children. Derivation of an integrated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic propofol model, containing remifentanil pharmacodynamic interaction information, enables propofol effect-site target-controlled infusion in children with a better prediction of its hypnotic effect when both drugs are combined.
We designed this study to derive an integrated propofol pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model in children and to describe the pharmacodynamic interaction between propofol and remifentanil on the electroencephalographic bispectral index effect.
Thirty children (mean age: 5.45 years, range 1.3-11.9; mean weight: 23.5 kg, range 8.5-61) scheduled for elective surgery with general anesthesia were studied. After sevoflurane induction, maintenance of anesthesia was based on propofol and remifentanil. Blood samples to measure propofol concentration were collected during anesthesia maintenance and up to 6 hours in the postoperative period. Bispectral index data were continuously recorded throughout the study. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was developed using population modeling. The Greco model was used to examine the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interaction between propofol and remifentanil for BIS response RESULTS: Propofol pharmacokinetic data from a previous study in 53 children were pooled with current data and simultaneously analyzed. Propofol pharmacokinetics were adequately described by a three-compartment distribution model with first-order elimination. Theory-based allometric relationships based on TBW improved the model fit. The Greco model supported an additive interaction between propofol and remifentanil. Remifentanil showed only a minor effect in BIS response.

Anesthetic drugs may exert neurotoxic effects and contribute to the genesis of POCD. The hypothesis of the POCD-ELA trial was that closed-loop target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil could reduce the occurrence of POCD by decreasing the risk of excessive depth of anesthesia and the dose of anesthetic drugs.
We designed a single-center, single-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel trial and aim to include 204 patients aged >60 years undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery. Patients will be randomized to receive closed-loop versus manual target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil guided by bispectral index monitoring. Cognitive assessment will be performed the day before surgery (baseline) and within 72 hours after surgery, using a battery of validated neuropsychological tests. The primary outcome is the incidence of POCD within 72 hours after surgery. POCD is defined as a Z-score value > 1.96 for at least 2 different tests or a Z-score composite value >1.96.

50 children aged 2-14 years undergoing deep sedation were randomly assigned to 2 groups: (A) watching or (B) not watching a standardized videoclip during sleep induction with propofol. The achievement of predefined sedation depth was objectified by measuring Comfort Score (aim 10-14) and Bispectral Index (aim 50-60).
The median sleep induction dose of propofol did not differ in both groups (A: 1.76 (0.62-4.37) mg/kg; B: 1.37 (0.66-5.26) mg/kgKG; p=0.65). Cartoon watching was associated with shorter sleep onset latency (A: 120 (60-480)s; B: 240 (40-600)s; p=0.043). Subgroup analysis reveals this especially for school children and girls.

This study analyzed EDA changes due to pain stimulus in sedated adult critical care patients Methods: Skin conductance variability, selected hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, Bispectral index (BIS) and ambient noise level, were monitored during 4 hour routine daytime in an adult ICU. 4h-Measurements were divided into 2 groups, based upon the sedation level of the patients: Group A - Ramsay Sedation Score 2-4 and Group B - Ramsay Sedation Score of 5-6. Selected recordings before and after pain stimulus were performed. The stimulus chosen was the pressure applied to nail bed for 10 sec, which was performed routinely during neurological examination. Patients' demographics, laboratory exams and severity scores were recorded. Pain status evaluation before every event was also performed by 2 independent observers via Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and Adult Non Verbal Pain Score (ANVPS) Results: In both groups the rate of EDA changes was greater than other monitoring parameters: more in Group A than in Group B. Yet, the difference between groups was not statistically significant.
EDA measurements are greater to pain stimuli, than cardiovascular, respiratory or even BIS monitoring. These encouraging results suggest that, further studies are needed to better define EDA role in ICU.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30216182/
30209784,Time to recovery after general anesthesia at hospitals with and without a phase I post-anesthesia care unit: a historical cohort study.,Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2018,"Thenuwara KN, Yoshimura T, Nakata Y, Dexter F","There is little knowledge about how hospitals can best handle disruptions that reduce post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) capacity. Few hospitals in Japan have any PACU beds and instead have the anesthesiologists recover their patients in the operating room. We compared postoperative recovery times between a hospital with (University of Iowa) and without (Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital) a PACU.
This historical cohort study included 16 successive patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery with endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia, at each of the hospitals, and with the hours from OR entrance until the last surgical dressing applied ≥ two hours. Postoperative recovery times, defined as the end of surgery until leaving for the surgical ward, were compared between the hospitals.
The median [interquartile range] of recovery times was 112 [94-140] min at the University of Iowa and 22 [18-29] min at the Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital. Every studied patient at the University of Iowa had a longer recovery time than every such patient at Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, P < 0.001). The ratio of the mean recovery times was 4.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.05 to 5.91; P < 0.001) and remained comparable after controlling for surgical duration (5.33; 95% CI, 3.66 to 7.76; P < 0.001). The anesthetics used in the Iowa hospital were a volatile agent, hydromorphone, ketorolac, and neostigmine compared with the Japanese hospital where bispectral index monitoring and target-controlled infusions of propofol, remifentanil, acetaminophen, and sugammadex were used.
This knowledge can be generally applied in situations at hospitals with regular PACU use when there are such large disruptions to PACU capacity that it is known before a case begins that the anesthesiologist likely will need to recover the patient (i.e., when there will not be an available PACU bed and/or nurse). The Japanese anesthesiologists have no PACU labour costs but likely greater anesthesia drug/monitor costs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30209784/

We conducted this study to assess the antiemetic properties of propofol for the prevention and immediate treatment of post-delivery nausea and vomiting during cesarean section under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia.
Eighty women undergoing elective cesarean delivery under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia were randomized to receive either propofol at a plasma concentration of 1000 ng/mL or normal saline immediately after clamping of the umbilical cord. The incidence of post-delivery nausea and vomiting, patients requiring rescue antiemetic, bispectral index, sedation score, and the incidence of hypotension were assessed intraoperatively. Satisfaction and neonatal behavioral neurological assessments were evaluated postoperatively.
The incidence of nausea was significantly lower in the propofol group compared to the placebo group (25% versus 60%, P < 0.001). The incidence of retching and vomiting showed no significant difference between the two groups. Propofol 20 mg as a rescue antiemetic was significantly effective in both the groups.

How closely these methods match the patient's experience is unknown.
Determine the efficacy and effectiveness of breakthrough medication in unresponsive patients and the perception of patient comfort made by nurses and family.
A prospective study of breakthrough medication in unresponsive patients. The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and Patient Comfort Score (PCS) were compared with time-matched Bispectral Index (BIS) Scores. The effects of opioid vs. opioid + benzodiazepine breakthroughs and the relation between synchronous nurse and family measurements of the PCS were evaluated. Analysis of variance and paired t-tests were used for BIS analyses and nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests for RASS and PCS.
Significant reductions at 30 and 60 minutes after breakthrough medication were noted for BIS (P < 0.0004), RASS (P = 0.043 and 0.004, respectively), and PCS (P < 0.0004). A direct comparison of the effect of opioid breakthrough medication vs. opioid plus benzodiazepine revealed no significant difference (BIS, P = 0.512; RASS, P = 0.195; PCS, P = 0.119). Of the 157 synchronous nurse and family measures of patient comfort, families rated patient discomfort significantly higher than nurses (P < 0.0004).
This study provides additional evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of breakthrough medication and the merit of observational measures in determining a patient's response.

30198934,Pupillary Pain Index Changes After a Standardized Bolus of Alfentanil Under Sevoflurane Anesthesia: First Evaluation of a New Pupillometric Index to Assess the Level of Analgesia During General Anesthesia.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2019,"Sabourdin N, Diarra C, Wolk R, Piat V, Louvet N, Constant I","The pupillary pain index (PPI) is a novel pupillometric index, designed to assess intraoperative analgesia. It is based on the evaluation of the pupillary response to electrical stimuli of increasing intensity. It ranges from 1 (low level of pupillary reactivity, high level of analgesia) to 10 (high level of pupillary reactivity, low level of analgesia). In this first evaluation of the PPI, our objective was to investigate the PPI changes after a bolus of 10 µg·kg(-1) of alfentanil in children under sevoflurane general anesthesia.
After ethics committee approval and informed consent, 20 healthy children (9 ± 5 years) undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia were included in this prospective, open, registered pilot study (NCT02646592). Anesthetic induction was standardized with sevoflurane 6% and propofol 1 mg·kg(-1). After tracheal intubation, sevoflurane concentration was maintained at 2% for 10 minutes. A first PPI measurement was performed (PPI-1), and a bolus of 10 µg·kg(-1) was administered. Two minutes after this bolus, a second PPI measurement was performed (PPI-2). Heart rate, blood pressure, and bispectral index were recorded before and after each PPI measurement. Resting pupillary diameter was recorded before each PPI measurement. PPI scores before and after the bolus of alfentanil were compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test.
PPI scores decreased after administration of a bolus of alfentanil (median difference: -3 [95% confidence interval, -4 to -2]). The median (quartiles) of PPI-1 (baseline, before alfentanil) was 6 (4, 7), and the median (quartiles) of PPI-2 (after alfentanil) was 2 (2, 3) (P < .001). No difference was found in resting pupillary diameter before PPI-1 and PPI-2 (2.2 ± 0.2 and 2.2 ± 0.3 mm, respectively; P = .86). There were no significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure after PPI measurements (P = .46 and .49, respectively). Bispectral index was slightly increased after PPI measurements (P = .01; mean bispectral index increase <5%). No withdrawal movements occurred during PPI measurements.
There was a significant decrease in PPI after alfentanil administration. The results of this pilot study suggest that PPI score decreases when the level of analgesia increases. PPI measurement was not associated with a clinical or hemodynamic nociceptive response. This new index might provide useful information to individually adapt opioid administration before nociceptive stimuli under general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30198934/

Several studies have evaluated the potential association between bispectral index (BIS) and intraoperative awareness, however, the results obtained were controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to further assess the association between the BIS monitoring and the incidence of intraoperative awareness. A comprehensive search was conducted to identify all eligible studies from the online literature databases published prior to Feb. 2017. A total of five studies with 17 432 cases and 16 749 controls were included. An odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to examine the strength of the association. The results showed that in the overall analysis, the association between the BIS monitoring and the incidence of intraoperative awareness was not significant (OR=0.58, 95% CI= 0.22-1.58, P=0.29). A stratified analysis by comparing different anesthesia methods revealed that BIS monitoring group showed a lower incidence of intraoperative awareness in patients with intravenous anesthesia when compared with non-BIS monitoring group (OR=0.20, 95% CI=0.08-0.49, P=0.0004), whereas there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of intraoperative awareness between BIS and non-BIS monitoring groups in patients with inhalation anesthesia (OR=1.13, 95% CI=0.56-2.26, P=0.73).

We previously reported that caffeine is able to accelerate emergence from anesthesia in rodents. This study was carried out to test the hypothesis that caffeine accelerates emergence from anesthesia in humans.
We conducted a single-center, randomized, double-blind crossover study with eight healthy males. Each subject was anesthetized twice with 1.2% isoflurane for 1 h. During the final 10 min of each session, participants received an IV infusion of either caffeine citrate (15 mg/kg, equivalent to 7.5 mg/kg of caffeine base) or saline placebo. The primary outcome was the average difference in time to emergence after isoflurane discontinuation between caffeine and saline sessions. Secondary outcomes included the end-tidal isoflurane concentration at emergence, vital signs, and Bispectral Index values measured throughout anesthesia and emergence. Additional endpoints related to data gathered from postanesthesia psychomotor testing.
All randomized participants were included in the analysis. The mean time to emergence with saline was 16.5 ± 3.9 (SD) min compared to 9.6 ± 5.1 (SD) min with caffeine (P = 0.002), a difference of 6.9 min (99% CI, 1.8 to 12), a 42% reduction. Participants emerged at a higher expired isoflurane concentration, manifested more rapid return to baseline Bispectral Index values, and were able to participate in psychomotor testing sooner when receiving caffeine. There were no statistically significant differences in vital signs with caffeine administration and caffeine-related adverse events.

29994943,Anesthesia for electroconvulsive therapy.,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2018,"Soehle M, Bochem J","Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well established and effective therapy in treatment-resistant depression. It is performed under general anesthesia, but no consensus exists regarding the optimal anesthetic drugs. A growing interest in optimizing adjunctive medication regimes in ECT anesthesia has emerged in recent years. Moreover different methods of seizure induction have been evaluated.
Pretreatment with dexmedetomidine eased the propofol injection pain and reduced the hyperdynamic response to ECT, but prolonged recovery. Remifentanil exhibited no proconvulsive effect and had no effect on seizure quality. Ketamine showed an antidepressive effect but was associated with cardiovascular side effects and an increased recovery time. A bispectral index-guided anesthesia or a time delay between anesthesia and seizure induction resulted in a better seizure quality presumably by avoiding high concentrations of (anticonvulsive) hypnotics. Seizure induction by magnetism seems to be an alternative to ECT, as the former is associated with less cognitive side effects but comparable antidepressive efficacy.
The current practice of anesthesia for ECT should not be modified, as the evidence of studies is either too low or the results are inconsistent. Some approaches are promising but require validation in further studies with a higher number of participants.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29994943/

With accurate and fast depth of anaesthesia measuring, the monitor can reduce the incidence of awareness during surgical operation. The proposed denoising method for extracting 40-Hz auditory steady-state cycles, adaptive multilevel wavelet denoising, enabled the system to extract auditory steady-state response cycles from fewer epochs and over short periods of time which is of crucial importance in monitoring anaesthesia. The noise estimation scheme, adaptive threshold levels, rearranging, and multilevel denoising of frames increase the accuracy and signal to noise ratio of the extracted cycles. The modified fuzzy c-means clustering scheme, proposed to improve clustering performance in noisy data bases where no prior information about the level of noise and signal energy is available, is used for clustering the auditory steady-state cycles. Weighting the features with a novel algorithm and based on their differentiating role in clustering, the modified fuzzy c-means improves fuzziness in cluster partitions and the geometrical structure of the data. An index called depth of anaesthesia index is defined and determined at each cycle based on the clustering information of the cycle and the previous ones. The algorithm is applied to auditory steady-state response signals recorded from 20 human subjects during surgical operations with Propofol-induced general anaesthesia. The accuracy of the depth of anaesthesia index is validated through the subjects' medical markers, clinical parameters, and the recorded bispectral index during the induction phase. Depth of anaesthesia index is verified to be accurate and able to detect fast transitions between different levels of anaesthesia. The computed depth of anaesthesia indices detected the induction of anaesthesia on average 55 s faster than bispectral index and 17 s earlier than loss of eyelash reflex.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29990070/

Seventy-five patients, 1-18 years of age (stratified for age; 1-3, 3-6, 6-18 years, for subgroup analyses), were included in this prospective observational study. The aepEX and the bispectral index (BIS) were recorded simultaneously, the latter serving as a reference. The ability of the aepEX to detect different levels of consciousness, defined according to the University of Michigan Sedation Scale, investigated using prediction probability (Pk), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, served as the primary outcome parameter. As a secondary outcome parameter, the relationship between end-tidal desflurane and the aepEX and BIS values were calculated by fitting in a nonlinear regression model.
The Pk values for the aepEX and the BIS were, respectively, .68 (95% CI, 0.53-0.82) and .85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.96; P = .02).

However, the distinct EEG dynamic characteristics at comparable sedation levels have not been well studied, resulting in potential interpretation errors in EEG monitoring during sedation. We aimed to analyze the EEG dynamics of dexmedetomidine and propofol at comparable sedation levels and to explore EEG changes with increased sedation levels for each agent. We measured the Bispectral Index (BIS) and 20-channel EEG under dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation from wakefulness, moderate sedation, and deep sedation to recovery in healthy volunteers (n = 10) in a randomized, 2-day, crossover study. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels. Despite similar changes in increased delta oscillations, multiple differences in the EEG spatiotemporal dynamics were observed between these two agents. During moderate sedation, both dexmedetomidine and propofol induced increased spindle power; however, dexmedetomidine decreased the global alpha/beta/gamma power, whereas propofol decreased the alpha power in the occipital area and increased the global spindle/beta/gamma power. During deep sedation, dexmedetomidine was associated with increased fronto-central spindle power and decreased global alpha/beta/gamma power, but propofol was associated with increased theta/alpha/spindle/beta power, which was maximized in the frontal area. The transition of topographic alpha/spindle/beta power distribution from moderate sedation to deep sedation completely differed between these two agents. Our study demonstrated that there was a distinct hierarchy of EEG changes with increased sedation depths by propofol and dexmedetomidine. Differences in EEG dynamics at the same sedation level might account for differences in the BIS value and reflect the different sedation mechanisms. EEG-based clinical sedation monitoring should consider the effect of drug types on EEG dynamics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29920532/

Five cohorts involving 40 subjects received increasing infusion doses of ABP-700, propofol 60 μg kg
No serious AEs were reported. Haemodynamic and respiratory effects included mild dose-dependent tachycardia, slightly elevated blood pressure, and no centrally mediated apnoea. Upon stimulation with ACTH, no adrenocortical depression was observed in any subject. Involuntary muscle movements (IMM) were reported, which were more extensive with higher dosing regimens. Higher dosages of ABP-700 were associated with deeper sedation and increased likelihood of sedation. Time to onset of clinical effect was variable throughout the cohorts and recovery was swift.
Infusions of ABP-700 showed a dose-dependent hypnotic effect, and did not cause severe hypotension, severe respiratory depression, or adrenocortical suppression. The presentation and nature of IMM is a matter of concern.

The closed-loop anesthesia delivery system (CLADS) is a method to automatically administer propofol total intravenous anesthesia using bi-spectral index (BIS) feedback and attain general anesthesia (GA) steady state with greater consistency. This study assessed whether dexmedetomidine is effective in further lowering the propofol requirements for total intravenous anesthesia facilitated by CLADS.
After ethics committee approval and written informed consent, 80 patients undergoing elective major laparoscopic/robotic surgery were randomly allocated to receive GA with propofol CLADS with or without the addition of dexmedetomidine. Quantitative reduction of propofol and quality of depth-of-anesthesia (primary objectives), intraoperative hemodynamics, incidence of postoperative adverse events (sedation, analgesia, nausea, and vomiting), and intraoperative awareness recall (secondary objectives) were analyzed.
There was a statistically significant lowering of propofol requirement (by 15%) in the dexmedetomidine group for induction of anesthesia (dexmedetomidine group: mean ± standard deviation 0.91 ± 0.26 mg/kg; nondexmedetomidine group: 1.07 ± 0.23 mg/kg, mean difference: 0.163, 95% CI, 0.04-0.28; P = .01) and maintenance of GA (dexmedetomidine group: 3.25 ± 0.97 mg/kg/h; nondexmedetomidine group: 4.57 ± 1.21 mg/kg/h, mean difference: 1.32, 95% CI, 0.78-1.85; P < .001). The median performance error of BIS control, a measure of bias, was significantly lower in dexmedetomidine group (1% [-5.8%, 8%]) versus nondexmedetomidine group (8% [2%, 12%]; P = .002). No difference was found for anesthesia depth consistency parameters, including percentage of time BIS within ±10 of target (dexmedetomidine group: 79.5 [72.5, 85.3]; nondexmedetomidine group: 81 [68, 88]; P = .534), median absolute performance error (dexmedetomidine group: 12% [10%, 14%]; nondexmedetomidine group: 12% [10%, 14%]; P = .777), wobble (dexmedetomidine group: 10% [8%, 10%]; nondexmedetomidine group: 8% [6%, 10%]; P = .080), and global score (dexmedetomidine group: 25.2 [23.1, 35.8]; nondexmedetomidine group: 24.7 [20, 38.1]; P = .387). Similarly, there was no difference between the groups for percentage of time intraoperative heart rate and mean arterial pressure remained within 20% of baseline. However, addition of dexmedetomidine to CLADS propofol increased the incidence of significant bradycardia (dexmedetomidine group: 14 [41.1%]; nondexmedetomidine group: 3 [9.1%]; P = .004), hypotension (dexmedetomidine group: 9 [26.5%]; nondexmedetomidine group: 2 [6.1%]; P = .045), and early postoperative sedation.
The addition of dexmedetomidine to propofol administered by CLADS was associated with a consistent depth of anesthesia along with a significant decrease in propofol requirements, albeit with an incidence of hemodynamic depression and early postoperative sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29787410/
29770643,Use of the Bispectral Index to Predict Eye Position of Children during General Anesthesia.,Korean journal of ophthalmology : KJO,2018,"Kook KH, Chung SA, Park S, Kim DH","To assess the relationship between eye position and anesthesia depth using the bispectral index (BIS) value, a parameter derived from electroencephalography data.
We investigated the relationship between BIS value and eye position in 32 children who underwent surgery for epiblepharon under general anesthesia. BIS values were recorded continuously throughout the procedure (from induction to awakening). Eye positions were video-recorded and analyzed after surgery. The vertical position of each eye was scored according to its height in relation to the medial canthus. An eye position in which the upper eyelid covered one-third of the cornea was defined as a significant ocular elevation.
The BIS value correlated inversely with the end-tidal concentration of each anesthetic agent, whereas it correlated positively with the eye elevation score (eye position = 0.014 × BIS + 0.699, p = 0.011). The mean eye position score was significantly greater in patients whose BIS values were over 65. Eleven patients (34.4%) had significant ocular elevation; their mean concurrent BIS value was 61.6. Two of these patients had elevation during surgery and 9 had elevation during emergence from anesthesia.
We found that high BIS values were correlated with low levels of anesthetic concentration and high eye position, suggesting that BIS monitoring may be useful for predicting eye position during anesthesia. Particular attention must be given to eye position during ophthalmic surgery. Anesthesia depth can be maintained by assuring that the BIS value remains below 65.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29770643/

The aim of this study was to evaluate the NOL to detect standardized nociceptive stimuli with various remifentanil dosages under general anesthesia.
A prospective, observational study at a single center (NCT02602379) included 40 ASA I to III patients undergoing laparotomy under remifentanil-desflurane anesthesia with epidural analgesia. A tetanic stimulation was applied (forearm) at remifentanil intravenous (IV) infusion of 0.005, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 µg/kg/min. NOL and its variations were compared with other parameters namely heart rate, mean arterial pressure, Bispectral Index, and Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to assess the response to both intubation and standardized stimulus under remifentanil infusion of 0.005 µg/kg/min.
The post-stimulation NOL values at remifentanil doses of 0.005, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 µg/kg/min (39 [23-55], 15 [7-30], 8 [4-14] and 8.5 [4-15]) were significantly higher than pre-stimulation counterparts (P<0.0001). For all other parameters, there was also significant difference between pre- and post-stimulation values at all remifentanil dosages (P<0.0001). Area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the NOL during standardized stimulation was larger than for all other parameters at the exception of ANI (P=0.94). The AUC of NOL for nociception during tracheal intubation was greater (0.93 vs. 0.84 and 0.64 for ANI and HR, respectively).
NOL monitoring is a promising index to assess the level of nociception in patients under general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29756750/

Preclinical studies show that carbon dioxide decreases propofol-mediated respiratory depression. We studied whether elevation of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) via carbon dioxide insufflation reverses the airway collapsibility (primary hypothesis) and impaired genioglossus muscle electromyogram that accompany propofol anesthesia.
We present a prespecified, secondary analysis of previously published experiments in 12 volunteers breathing via a high-flow respiratory circuit used to control upper airway pressure under propofol anesthesia at two levels, with the deep level titrated to suppression of motor response. Ventilation, mask pressure, negative pharyngeal pressure, upper airway closing pressure, genioglossus electromyogram, bispectral index, and change in end-expiratory lung volume were measured as a function of elevation of PETCO2 above baseline and depth of propofol anesthesia.
PETCO2 augmentation dose-dependently lowered upper airway closing pressure with a decrease of 3.1 cm H2O (95% CI, 2.2 to 3.9; P < 0.001) under deep anesthesia, indicating improved upper airway stability. In parallel, the phasic genioglossus electromyogram increased by 28% (23 to 34; P < 0.001). We found that genioglossus electromyogram activity was a significant modifier of the effect of PETCO2 elevation on closing pressure (P = 0.005 for interaction term).
Upper airway collapsibility induced by propofol anesthesia can be reversed in a dose-dependent manner by insufflation of supplemental carbon dioxide. This effect is at least partly mediated by increased genioglossus muscle activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29750662/
29746721,Melatonin for the promotion of sleep in adults in the intensive care unit.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2018,"Lewis SR, Pritchard MW, Schofield-Robinson OJ, Alderson P, Smith AF","Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) experience sleep deprivation caused by environmental disruption, such as high noise levels and 24-hour lighting, as well as increased patient care activities and invasive monitoring as part of their care. Sleep deprivation affects physical and psychological health, and patients perceive the quality of their sleep to be poor whilst in the ICU. Artificial lighting during night-time hours in the ICU may contribute to reduced production of melatonin in critically ill patients. Melatonin is known to have a direct effect on the circadian rhythm, and it appears to reset a natural rhythm, thus promoting sleep.
To assess whether the quantity and quality of sleep may be improved by administration of melatonin to adults in the intensive care unit. To assess whether melatonin given for sleep promotion improves both physical and psychological patient outcomes.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2017), Embase (1974 to September 2017), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to September 2017), and PsycINFO (1806 to September 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.
We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials with adult participants (over the age of 16) admitted to the ICU with any diagnoses given melatonin versus a comparator to promote overnight sleep. We included participants who were mechanically ventilated and those who were not mechanically ventilated. We planned to include studies that compared the use of melatonin, given at an appropriate clinical dose with the intention of promoting night-time sleep, against no agent; or against another agent administered specifically to promote sleep.
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.
We included four studies with 151 randomized participants. Two studies included participants who were mechanically ventilated, one study included a mix of ventilated and non-ventilated participants and in one study participants were being weaned from mechanical ventilation. Three studies reported admission diagnoses, which varied: these included sepsis, pneumonia and cardiac or cardiorespiratory arrest. All studies compared melatonin against no agent; three were placebo-controlled trials; and one compared melatonin with usual care. All studies administered melatonin in the evening.All studies reported adequate methods for randomization and placebo-controlled trials were blinded at the participant and personnel level. We noted high risk of attrition bias in one study and were unclear about potential bias introduced in two studies with differences between participants at baseline.It was not appropriate to combine data owing to differences in measurement tools, or methods used to report data.The effects of melatonin on subjectively rated quantity and quality of sleep are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Three studies (139 participants) reported quantity and quality of sleep as measured through reports of participants or family members or by personnel assessments. Study authors in one study reported no difference in sleep efficiency index scores between groups for participant assessment (using Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire) and nurse assessment. Two studies reported no difference in duration of sleep observed by nurses.The effects of melatonin on objectively measured quantity and quality of sleep are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (37 participants) reported quantity and quality of sleep as measured by polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, bispectral index (BIS) or electroencephalogram (EEG). Study authors in one study reported no difference in sleep efficiency index scores between groups using BIS and actigraphy. These authors also reported longer sleep in participants given melatonin which was not statistically significant, and improved sleep (described as ""better sleep"") in participants given melatonin from analysis of area under the curve (AUC) of BIS data. One study used PSG but authors were unable to report data because of a large loss of participant data.One study (82 participants) reported no evidence of a difference in anxiety scores (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (94 participants) reported data for mortality: one study reported that overall one-third of participants died; and one study reported no evidence of difference between groups in hospital mortality (very low certainty). One study (82 participants) reported no evidence of a difference in length of ICU stay (very low certainty evidence). Effects of melatonin on adverse events were reported in two studies (107 participants), and are uncertain (very low certainty evidence): one study reported headache in one participant given melatonin, and one study reported excessive sleepiness in one participant given melatonin and two events in the control group (skin reaction in one participant, and excessive sleepiness in another participant).The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was limited by sparse data with few participants. We noted study limitations in some studies due to high attrition and differences between groups in baseline data; and doses of melatonin varied between studies. Methods used to measure data were not consistent for outcomes, and use of some measurement tools may not be effective for use on the ICU patient. All studies included participants in the ICU but we noted differences in ICU protocols, and one included study used a non-standard sedation protocol with participants which introduced indirectness to the evidence.
We found insufficient evidence to determine whether administration of melatonin would improve the quality and quantity of sleep in ICU patients. We identified sparse data, and noted differences in study methodology, in ICU sedation protocols, and in methods used to measure and report sleep. We identified five ongoing studies from database and clinical trial register searches. Inclusion of data from these studies in future review updates would provide more certainty for the review outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29746721/

Published comparative studies have used propofol or sevoflurane. However, studies using desflurane have not been reported yet. Different volatile anesthetics have different electroencephalography signatures. The performance of CSI may be different in desflurane anesthesia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare CSI and BIS during desflurane anesthesia.
Thirty-three patients were recruited. Desflurane and remifentanil were used to maintain general anesthesia. BIS and CSI were recorded simultaneously every minute. End-tidal concentration of desflurane was maintained at 4% from the beginning of surgery for 5 minutes. Pairwise data of CSI and BIS were obtained five times at one-minute intervals. This process was repeated in the order of 6%, 8%, and 10%.
BIS and CSI were negatively correlated with the end-tidal concentration of desflurane with a similar degree of correlation (correlation coefficient BIS: -0.847, CSI: -0.844). The relationship between CSI and BIS had a good linearity with a slope close to 1 (R2 = 0.905, slope = 1.01). For the relationship between CSI and BIS at each end-tidal concentration of desflurane, CSI and BIS showed good linearity in 4% and 10% (R2 = 0.559, 0.540). However, the linearity and slope were decreased in 6% and 8% (R2 = 0.163, 0.014).
CSI showed an equivalent degree of overall performance compared to BIS in desflurane anesthesia. Accounting for previous literature, CSI can be used as a good substitute for BIS regardless of the kind of anesthetics used.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29739183/

Hypoglycemia is associated with changes in electroencephalogram readings. Here, we report two cases of patients with an abnormally low Bispectral Index (BIS) associated with diabetic retinopathy surgery, one in the recovery stage of general anesthesia and the other in the maintenance of general anesthesia. Hemodynamics were stable. Severe hypoglycemia (1.6 mmol/L and 2.2 mmol/L) was then detected. BIS increased with the correction of severe hypoglycemia.

The electrical properties of the skin, also known as electrodermal activity (EDA), are considered as an indirect measure of autonomous nervous system.
This study explores EDA changes during endotracheal suction in sedated adult critical care patients; and compares these changes to other monitoring parameters.
Skin conductance variability, selected hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, bispectral index (BIS) and ambient noise level, were monitored during 4 hour routine daytime intensive care nursing and treatment in an adult Intensive Care Unit. 4h-measurements were divided into 2 groups, based upon the sedation level (group A: Ramsay sedation scale 2-4 and group B: 5-6 respectively) of the patients. Selected recordings before and after endotracheal suction (stress events) were performed. Seven stress events from Group A and 17 from Group B were included for further analysis. Patients' demographics, laboratory exams and severity scores were recorded. Pain status evaluation before every event was also performed via 2 independent observers.
In both groups the rate of EDA changes was greater than in other monitoring parameters. Yet, in group A only selected parameters were significantly changed after the start of the procedure, while in group B, every parameter showed significant change (p<0.05). Groups were similar for other co-founding factors.
EDA measurements are more sensitive to stress stimuli, than cardiovascular, respiratory or even BIS monitoring. Deeper sedation seems to affect more the intensity of EDA changes during suction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29668462/

As target-controlled infusion (TCI) obviates the need to manually calculate the infusion rate, the use of TCI may better match clinical requirements, reduce propofol dose, and shorten recovery time.
Children of ASA grade 1, aged 1-12 yr, were recruited and randomly assigned to TCI or manual infusion. Children in the TCI group had propofol delivered by TCI. Children for manual infusion had a loading dose of 2.5 mg kg
Seventy-four children completed the study. The time taken to extubate the trachea after cessation of propofol was 15.1 (5.5) and 16.2 (6.1) min for children who had TCI and manual infusion, respectively (P=0.42). The mean propofol infusion rate was 16.7 [standard deviation (sd) 4.2] mg kg
Use of TCI led to higher propofol doses but not prolonged recovery time in children compared with manual infusion.

Two PICUs of university hospitals in Spain.
Prospective observational study and exploratory investigation conducted in two PICUs in Madrid, Spain, over a 6-year period. Children treated with inhaled sevoflurane due to difficult sedation were included. Sevoflurane was administered via the anesthetic conserving device (AnaConDa) connected to a Servo-I ventilator (Maquet, Solna, Sweden). A morphine infusion was added to sevoflurane for analgesia. Demographic and clinical data, oral and IV sedatives, Sedation and Analgesic Clinical scores, and Bispectral Index Score monitoring were registered.
Twenty-three patients with a median age of 6 months old were included. Fifty percentage of the patients had critical heart diseases. Sedative and analgesic drugs used before starting sevoflurane were mainly midazolam (63%) and fentanyl (53%). Six patients (32%) also received muscle relaxants. Sevoflurane was administered for a median of 5 days (interquartile range, 5.5-8.5 d). Median end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was 0.8% (interquartile range, 0.7-0.85%), achieved with an infusion rate of 7.5 mL/hr (5.7-8.6 mL/hr). After 48 hours of treatment, some sedative drugs could be removed in 18 patients (78%). Median Bispectral Index Score value prior to sevoflurane administration was 61 (interquartile range, 49-62), falling to 42 (interquartile range, 41-47; p < 0.05) after 6 hours of treatment. Six patients (26%) presented withdrawal syndrome after sevoflurane suspension, and all of them had received sevoflurane at least for 6 days. The main side effect was moderate hypotension in seven patients (30%).
Inhaled sevoflurane appeared to be an effective sedative agent in critically ill children and can be useful in those patients on mechanical ventilation difficult to sedate with conventional drugs.

All patients received routine monitoring, and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were recorded. The bispectral index and the isolated forearm technique were used to determine the depth of anaesthesia. Results Bispectral index values at skin and uterine incisions and at delivery were similar among the groups. The number of patients who responded positively to the isolated arm technique during the induction period was also similar. One-minute Apgar scores in the control group were significantly lower and 5-minute Apgar scores significantly higher than those in the other groups. Conclusion The effects of remifentanil and dexmedetomidine added to propofol on maternal awareness, neonatal Apgar scores, and bispectral index values were similar compared with propofol alone.

Maintaining the bispectral index (BIS) or state entropy (SE) between 40 and 60 has been recommended to mitigate anesthesia awareness. Nonetheless, SEs > 70 were frequently observed at end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations unlikely to allow awareness. We sought to determine the prevalence of elevated discordant measurements during BIS and SE monitoring.
Electronic data collected over 11 months at two academic hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. At the hospital using SE, all cases were included with patients ≥ 18 yr and sevoflurane administered for at least 30 min during surgery. A cohort of cases propensity matched by age and American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status were selected from the hospital using BIS. Elevated discordant EEG indices were defined as values > 70 occurring during stable end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations > 1.5%. The odds ratio (OR) based on the probability of a case having at least one elevated discordant SE or BIS lasting ≥ two minutes (primary endpoint) was calculated.
At each hospital, 3,690 cases were studied. The mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) incidence of cases with at least one interval of an elevated discordant EEG index lasting at least two minutes was 3.6% (2.8% to 4.4%) for SE compared with 0.24% (0.17% to 0.27%) for BIS (pooled OR, 17.0; 95% CI, 8.3 to 34.7; P < 0.001).
The prevalence of an elevated discordant EEG index is much greater with SE than with BIS. Elevated index values occurring at anesthetic concentrations well above the awareness threshold need to be assessed to determine if they indicate an inadequate depth of anesthesia requiring treatment or if they simply reflect the underlying monitoring algorithm.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29524200/

We conducted a single-blind crossover study in 8 healthy volunteers to investigate whether DEX enhances the anesthetic effect of lidocaine in the oral cavity. DEX or DEX + lidocaine was injected into the labial gingiva corresponding to the root apex of the maxillary left central incisor and into the buccal gingiva corresponding to the root apex of the mandibular right first molar. Pain threshold, blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and bispectral index were measured 5 minutes after treatment and at 10-minute intervals for 60 minutes. DEX + lidocaine caused pulpal anesthesia in more subjects than lidocaine alone; this difference was significant for both central incisors and first molars up to 40 minutes after treatment. Following DEX + lidocaine treatment, blood pressure and bispectral index were significantly reduced at several time points, and pulse rate significantly reduced at all time points. Neither treatment caused changes in oxygen saturation. In conclusion, administering DEX with lidocaine for dental local anesthesia caused sedation and enhanced local anesthesia compared to lidocaine alone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29509522/
29464690,BIS monitoring versus clinical assessment for sedation in mechanically ventilated adults in the intensive care unit and its impact on clinical outcomes and resource utilization.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2018,"Shetty RM, Bellini A, Wijayatilake DS, Hamilton MA, Jain R, Karanth S, Namachivayam A","Patients admitted to intensive care and on mechanical ventilation, are administered sedative and analgesic drugs to improve both their comfort and interaction with the ventilator. Optimizing sedation practice may reduce mortality, improve patient comfort and reduce cost. Current practice is to use scales or scores to assess depth of sedation based on clinical criteria such as consciousness, understanding and response to commands. However these are perceived as subjective assessment tools. Bispectral index (BIS) monitors, which are based on the processing of electroencephalographic signals, may overcome the restraints of the sedation scales and provide a more reliable and consistent guidance for the titration of sedation depth.The benefits of BIS monitoring of patients under general anaesthesia for surgical procedures have already been confirmed by another Cochrane review. By undertaking a well-conducted systematic review our aim was to find out if BIS monitoring improves outcomes in mechanically ventilated adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
To assess the effects of BIS monitoring compared with clinical sedation assessment on ICU length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, any cause mortality, risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), risk of adverse events (e.g. self-extubation, unplanned disconnection of indwelling catheters), hospital LOS, amount of sedative agents used, cost, longer-term functional outcomes and quality of life as reported by authors for mechanically ventilated adults in the ICU.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ProQuest, OpenGrey and SciSearch up to May 2017 and checked references citation searching and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We searched trial registries, which included clinicaltrials.gov and controlled-trials.com.
We included all randomized controlled trials comparing BIS versus clinical assessment (CA) for the management of sedation in mechanically ventilated critically ill adults.
We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures. We undertook analysis using Revman 5.3 software.
We identified 4245 possible studies from the initial search. Of those studies, four studies (256 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One more study is awaiting classification. Studies were, conducted in single-centre surgical and mixed medical-surgical ICUs. BIS monitor was used to assess the level of sedation in the intervention arm in all the studies. In the control arm, the sedation assessment tools for CA included the Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS), Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) or subjective CA utilizing traditional clinical signs (heart rate, blood pressure, conscious level and pupillary size). Only one study was classified as low risk of bias, the other three studies were classified as high risk.There was no evidence of a difference in one study (N = 50) that measured ICU LOS (Median (Interquartile Range IQR) 8 (4 to 14) in the CA group; 12 (6 to 18) in the BIS group; low-quality evidence).There was little or no effect on the duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -0.02 days (95% CI -0.13 to 0.09; 2 studies; N = 155; I
We found insufficient evidence about the effects of BIS monitoring for sedation in critically ill mechanically ventilated adults on clinical outcomes or resource utilization.

Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II cases were randomly divided into two groups. Patients were connected to the monitor after premedication, and spinal anesthesia was administered. Sensory and motor blockades were assessed using pinprick test and Bromage scale, respectively. Group I received dexmedetomidine infusion and Group II received saline infusion. Throughout the infusion process, hemodynamic data, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, sedation, pain, Bromage score, amnesia, bispectral index, and side effects were recorded. Postoperative hemodynamic measurements, oxygen saturation, sedation, pain scores were obtained. Sedation and pain were evaluated using the Ramsay and visual analog scales, respectively. Analgesics were administered in cases with high scores on the visual analog scale. Postoperative analgesic consumption, side effects, treatments were recorded. No significant differences were found between the groups with respect to oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, pain, and side effects in the intraoperative period. Time to onset of sensorial block, maximum sensorial block, onset of motor block, and maximum motor block; bispectral index values; and apex heartbeat until 80 min of infusion, systolic arterial blood pressure until 90 min, and diastolic arterial blood pressure until 50 min were lower, whereas amnesia and sedation levels were higher in dexmedetomidine group. Postoperative pain and analgesic requirement were not different. Apex heartbeat at 15 min and systolic arterial blood pressure at 30 min were lower and sedation scores were higher in the dexmedetomidine infusion group. We demonstrated dexmedetomidine infusion had a hemodynamic depressant effect intraoperatively whereas it had no significant effect on peripheral oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, visual analog scale scores, and side effects.

Sixty patients scheduled to undergo elective non-laparoscopic renal surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled to receive either systemic lidocaine infusion (group L: bolus 1.5 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion at the rate of 2 mg/kg/hr until skin closure) or normal saline (0.9% NaCl solution) (Group C). The depth of anesthesia was monitored using the Bispectral Index Scale (BIS), which is based on measurement of the patient's cerebral electrical activity. Primary outcome of the study was End-tidal of isoflurane concentration (Et-Iso) at BIS values of 40-60. Secondary outcomes include remifentanil consumption during the operation and time to extubation.

This study was carried out in order to evaluate different methods of assessment of depth of sedation: bispectral index (BiS), modified Richmond Agitation/Sedation Scale (mRASS), modified Ramsay Sedation Scale (mRSS) and modified Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (mOAAS) and their applicability to clinical practice.
Two hundred patients were recruited. Sedation was given by standard clinical practice using propofol sedation or patient controlled sedation. Sedation was assessed on all patients using the above-mentioned methods. BiS was considered the reference point for sedation scales. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to determine the consistency of different scales in respect to each other and prediction probability and Spearman's correlation coefficients of sedation scales were calculated to show the relationship between sedation scales and BiS.
All scales showed high reliability with overall Cronbach's alpha 0.943. Dropping scales suggested better consistency between mOAAS, mRSS and mRASS than with BiS. Spearman's correlation and prediction probability showed similar results with all tested scales: mOAAS (0.695, 0.739), mRSS (0.673, 0.735), mRASS (0.683, 0.738), p < .01 for all scales.
All tested methods were found to be reliable in the assessment of the depth of sedation when compared with each other. However, mRASS, mRSS and mOAAS require the patient to respond to verbal or tactile stimulus, which may impair execution of ERCP, whereas BiS information is collected directly from electroencephalogram and thus may be preferable in clinical setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29411681/

The goals of this study were to compare the prediction probabilities of perfusion index and bispectral index in predicting awakening and in differentiating the different levels of arousal during emergence after sevoflurane anesthesia in children undergoing open inguinal hernia repairs.
Forty-five patients, aged 1 to 5 years, ASA Status I or II and scheduled for elective open inguinal hernia repairs under general anesthesia were enrolled. The perfusion index and bispectral index were monitored simultaneously during anesthesia recovery. The University of Michigan Sedation Scale was applied to evaluate the clinical arousal levels during emergence.

The aim of this study was to define the association of Bispectral Index (BIS) to the depth of sedation and airway obstruction events.
Forty-seven patients between 14-21 years old, who were candidates for 3rd molar teeth extraction, were enrolled in this study. Patients received a total of 4 mg midazolam, 100 microgram fentanyl followed by titrated incremental propofol in 10 mg. The Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS) was used to assess the depth of sedation. Each patient was attached to BIS monitor, while clinicians were not involved in the data collection process. Apnea, airway obstruction, O2 saturation, timing and interventions for controlling the situation were recorded. All data was synchronized with BIS data monitoring.
The results show that 97.5% of cases were ASA 1 and 2, with average age of 17.3 years (±1.4) and a median BMI of 26.1. By using linear regression, for every unit decrease of median RASS (less than zero), there was 1.78 decrease in mean BIS Score (P=0.045, 95% CI: 0.08-3.47). The mean BIS Index (over 1 minute) with airway obstruction was 64 (±10.2), which was significantly lower than the BIS during non-airway obstruction (77±11.6), (P<0.001). By using logistic regression analysis, for every on unit increase in BIS Index, there is 24% decrease in odds in having airway obstruction (P=0.0009, 95% CI: 0.65-8.94).

The aim is to adjust the drug dose to the real patient needs using heuristic knowledge provided by clinicians. A two-level computer decision system is proposed. The idea is to release the clinician from routine tasks so that he can focus on other variables of the patient.
The controller uses the Bispectral Index (BIS) to assess the hypnotic state of the patient. Fuzzy controller was included in a closed-loop system to reach the BIS target and reject disturbances. BIS was measured using a BIS VISTA monitor, a device capable of calculating the hypnosis level of the patient through EEG information. An infusion pump with propofol 1% is used to supply the drug to the patient. The inputs to the fuzzy inference system are BIS error and BIS rate. The output is infusion rate increment. The mapping of the input information and the appropriate output is given by a rule-base based on knowledge of clinicians.
To evaluate the performance of the fuzzy closed-loop system proposed, an observational study was carried out. Eighty one patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery were randomly distributed in 2 groups: one group using a fuzzy logic based closed-loop system (FCL) to automate the administration of propofol (42 cases); the second group using manual delivering of the drug (39 cases). In both groups, the BIS target was 50.

29308828,Propofol for the promotion of sleep in adults in the intensive care unit.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2018,"Lewis SR, Schofield-Robinson OJ, Alderson P, Smith AF","People in the intensive care unit (ICU) experience sleep deprivation caused by environmental disruption, such as high noise levels and 24-hour lighting, as well as increased patient care activities and invasive monitoring as part of their care. Sleep deprivation affects physical and psychological health, and people perceive the quality of their sleep to be poor whilst in the ICU. Propofol is an anaesthetic agent which can be used in the ICU to maintain patient sedation and some studies suggest it may be a suitable agent to replicate normal sleep.
To assess whether the quantity and quality of sleep may be improved by administration of propofol to adults in the ICU and to assess whether propofol given for sleep promotion improves both physical and psychological patient outcomes.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2017), Embase (1974 to October 2017), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to October 2017) and PsycINFO (1806 to October 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.
We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials with adults, over the age of 16 years, admitted to the ICU with any diagnoses, given propofol versus a comparator to promote overnight sleep. We included participants who were and were not mechanically ventilated. We included studies that compared the use of propofol, given at an appropriate clinical dose with the intention of promoting night-time sleep, against: no agent; propofol at a different rate or dose; or another agent, administered specifically to promote sleep. We included only studies in which propofol was given during 'normal' sleeping hours (i.e. between 10 pm and 7 am) to promote a sleep-like state with a diurnal rhythm.
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and synthesized findings.
We included four studies with 149 randomized participants. We identified two studies awaiting classification for which we were unable to assess eligibility and one ongoing study.Participants differed in severity of illness as assessed by APACHE II scores in three studies and further differences existed between comparisons and methods. One study compared propofol versus no agent, one study compared different doses of propofol and two studies compared propofol versus a benzodiazepine (flunitrazepam, one study; midazolam, one study). All studies reported randomization and allocation concealment inadequately. We judged all studies to have high risk of performance bias from personnel who were unblinded. We noted that some study authors had blinded study outcome assessors and participants for relevant outcomes.It was not appropriate to combine data owing to high levels of methodological heterogeneity.One study comparing propofol with no agent (13 participants) measured quantity and quality of sleep using polysomnography; study authors reported no evidence of a difference in duration of sleep or sleep efficiency, and reported disruption to usual REM (rapid eye movement sleep) with propofol.One study comparing different doses of propofol (30 participants) measured quantity and quality of sleep by personnel using the Ramsay Sedation Scale; study authors reported that more participants who were given a higher dose of propofol had a successful diurnal rhythm, and achieved a greater sedation rhythmicity.Two studies comparing propofol with a different agent (106 participants) measured quantity and quality of sleep using the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; one study reported fewer awakenings of reduced duration with propofol, and similar total sleep time between groups, and one study reported no evidence of a difference in sleep quality. One study comparing propofol with another agent (66 participants) measured quantity and quality of sleep with the Bispectral Index and reported longer time in deep sleep, with fewer arousals. One study comparing propofol with another agent (40 participants) reported higher levels of anxiety and depression in both groups, and no evidence of a difference when participants were given propofol.No studies reported adverse events.We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of the evidence for each outcome to very low. We identified sparse data with few participants, and methodological differences in study designs and comparative agents introduced inconsistency, and we noted that measurement tools were imprecise or not valid for purpose.
We found insufficient evidence to determine whether administration of propofol would improve the quality and quantity of sleep in adults in the ICU. We noted differences in study designs, methodology, comparative agents and illness severity amongst study participants. We did not pool data and we used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of our evidence to very low.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29308828/

Many individuals who suffer from these disorders never recover conscious awareness. In this study, we aimed to identify an accurate and simple bedside method to predict awareness recovery after severe acute ischemic stroke.
Between 2013 and 2017, all consecutive patients with consciousness disorders after acute ischemic stroke were recruited to the study. The demographic data, Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Bispectral Index (BIS) were recorded at study entry and each day of Days 3-8 during the stroke period. We followed patients for 90days to assess whether the subjects recovered conscious awareness. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to evaluate the predictors' abilities for outcome prognosis.
We assessed a total of 102 patients. 23 (23%) patients died without awareness recovery, whereas 61 (60%) patients regained conscious awareness. The earliest time with the greatest ability to predict conscious awareness recovery occurred at Day 3 after stroke, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the multivariate model was 0.948 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.885 to 0.982). Age, BIS, motor response and brainstem responses were independent predictors for conscious awareness recovery. We subsequently created a 20-point score termed ""ABMB"" based on their coefficients in the Day 3 model. The AUC of ABMB at Day 3 was 0.931 (95% CI 0.882 to 0.980). The ABMB also showed good predictive ability at Days 4 and 5.
The ABMB score accurately identified patients who will recover conscious awareness within 90days after acute severe ischemic stroke and thus provides a useful outcome message for clinicians and relatives.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29246600/

The automated propofol-remifentanil titration by Bispectral Index (BIS) (AutoTIVA) avoids period of deep (BIS<40) anesthesia and could potentially decrease the ED. The aim of this study was to evaluate ED in surgical patients under AutoTIVA, manual titration of propofol-remifentanil (ManualTIVA) or volatile BIS-guided GA. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate age-related postoperative Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) changes.
One hundred and thirty-two adult patients scheduled for elective urologic surgery were randomized in: AutoTIVA, desflurane (DES), sevoflurane (SEVO), ManualTIVA anesthesia. The MMSE was performed before GA and 15 minutes after tracheal extubation.
The percentage of BIS 40-60 was significantly higher in the AutoTIVA compared to DES, SEVO and ManualTIVA (87% vs. 78 %, 58%, 39%, respectively; P≤0.001). The percentage of BIS<40 was significantly lower in AutoTIVA than in the other groups (P<0.001). No difference in hemodynamics was found among groups. Postoperative MMSE scores were similar to baseline in the AutoTIVA (26 [24-28] vs. 26 [23-28]) while they markedly decreased in all other groups (P<0.001). Postoperative MMSE decreased at any age. None experienced awareness was recorded.
Our results suggest that patients treated with AutoTIVA performed better in the cognitive test compared to the other groups receiving manual target-controlled GA due to a higher adequate level of anesthesia measured by BIS. Cognitive tests should be performed to test ED in all patients undergoing GA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29239148/

The aims of this study were to compare the efficacy and safety of nalbuphine with that of sufentanil in patients undergoing colonoscopy and to determine the optimal doses of nalbuphine in this indication.
Two hundred and forty consecutive eligible patients aged 18-65 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologists classification of I-II and scheduled for colonoscopy were randomly allocated to receive sufentanil 0.1 μg/kg (group S), nalbuphine 0.1 mg/kg (group N1), nalbuphine 0.15 mg/kg (group N2), or nalbuphine 0.2 mg/kg (group N3). Baseline vital signs were recorded before the procedure. The four groups were monitored for propofol sedation using the bispectral index, and pain relief was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale and the modified Behavioral Pain Scale for non-intubated patients. The incidences of respiratory depression during endoscopy, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and abdominal distention were recorded in the post anesthesia care unit and in the first and second 24-hour periods after colonoscopy.
There was no significant difference in analgesia between the sufentanil group and the nalbuphine groups (p>0.05). Respiratory depression was significantly more common in group S than in groups N1 and N2 (p<0.05). The incidence of nausea was significantly higher in the nalbuphine groups than in the sufentanil group in the first 24 hours after colonoscopy (p<0.05).
Nalbuphine can be considered as a reasonable alternative to sufentanil in patients undergoing colonoscopy. Doses in the range of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg are recommended.

Yet, types of sedation assessment tools and sedation levels that are suitable for sedation treatment have not been investigated.
To investigate the influence of different sedation levels guided by the Bispectral Index (BIS) on the therapeutic effects for severe TBI.
According to inclusion, exclusion, and rejection criteria, 35 patients were prospectively included and divided into Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), BIS(I), and BIS(II) groups. The RASS group was controlled the level of sedation to within -2 or -3, and the BIS(I) and (II) groups within the range of 40-50 and 50-60, respectively. In addition to clinical data, RASS, BIS, and intracranial pressure (ICP) values were collected. RASS and ICP variability were introduced to investigate the different of sedative control effect with or without BIS monitor, and the control effect of ICP between different sedation levels. Statistical analysis was performed to estimate the effectiveness of different sedation levels guided by BIS in sedation treatment within 72 hours.
There were no significant differences in demographics among the 3 groups. RASS variability of the BIS(I) and (II) groups was significantly lower than that of the RASS group (P < 0.05), and in the BIS(I) group it was insignificantly lower than in the BIS(II) group. The ICP of the BIS(I) and (II) groups declined to <13.5 mm Hg significantly earlier than that of the RASS group (P < 0.05), and the difference between BIS(I) and (II) was insignificant. ICP variability of RASS group was higher than those of the BIS(I) and (II) groups (P < 0.05), and ICP variability of the BIS(I) group was significantly lower than that of the BIS(II) group (P < 0.05). Differences in days in the neurosurgery intensive care unit and outcomes among the 3 groups were insignificant.
BIS is more reliable than RASS for maintaining a stable sedation status and ICP. Deeper sedation levels (BIS 40-50) cause ICP to decrease more quickly, with lower ICP variability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29196250/

For sedation monitoring clinical scores as Comfort Score (CS) as well as bispectral index (BIS) are frequently applied. The impact of BIS for sedation monitoring in pediatric patients is still under debate. This prospective study aims to investigate whether dual sedation monitoring of CS and BIS compared with monitoring of CS alone during muscle biopsies in children can reduce sedative doses, reduce awakening time and prevent complications.
50 pediatric patients requiring sedation for open muscle biopsy were prospectively enrolled. Analgosedation was performed with remifentanil and propofol. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: In 25 patients, sedation was monitored using CS alone, and in 25 patients CS and BIS monitoring were simultaneously applied. The primary outcome was the propofol dose applied during muscle biopsy. Secondary outcome parameters were recovery time and the frequency of complications.
The median CS during the intervention in both groups was equal (11, P=1.000). The median BIS in group 2 was 59. No complications occurred in either group. There was no difference in propofol dose in either group (8.4 vs. 7.2 mg/kg/h; P=0.58) and no difference in the duration until eye opening (9 vs. 11 min; P=0.081).
For children undergoing minor surgical procedures under analgosedation, BIS monitoring does not affect the sedative dose, the time until eye opening or the frequency of complications.
Zur Analgosedierung von Kindern hat sich eine Medikamentenkombination aus Propofol und Remifentanil bewährt. Zum Sedierungsmonitoring sind sowohl klinische Scores wie der Comfort Score (CS) als auch der bispektrale Index (BIS) üblich. Die Bedeutung von BIS zum Sedierungsmonitoring bei Kindern ist nach wie vor nicht eindeutig und Gegenstand wissenschaftlicher Diskussionen. Ziel der vorliegenden prospektiven Studie ist es zu untersuchen, ob bei pädiatrischen Patienten das kombinierte Sedierungsmonitoring mit CS und BIS verglichen mit einem alleinigen Monitoring mittels CS während offener Muskelbiopsien zu einer Reduktion der Sedativadosis, einer verkürzten Aufwachzeit und einer Reduktion der Häufigkeit von Komplikationen führt.
50 pädiatrische Patienten, die während offener Muskelbiopsien Propofol und Remifentanil zur Analgosedierung erhielten, wurden untersucht und dazu in 2 Gruppen randomisiert: Bei 25 Patienten wurde die Analgosedierung mittels CS allein, bei 25 mittels CS und zusätzlichem BIS Monitoring überwacht. Primärer Outcome Parameter war die benötigte Propofoldosis während des Eingriffs. Sekundäre outcome parameter waren Aufwachzeit und Häufigkeit von Komplikationen.
Der mediane CS während des Eingriffs war in beiden Gruppen gleich (11, P=1,000). Der mediane BIS in Gruppe 2 war 59. In beiden Gruppen kam es zu keinerlei Komplikationen. Es gab keinen Unterschied in der applizierten Propofoldosis (8,4 vs. 7,2 mg/kg/h; P=0,081) und in der Aufwachzeit zwischen beiden Gruppen (9 vs. 11 min; P=0,081).
Für die Analgosedierung während kleiner chirurgischer Eingriffe bei pädiatrischen Patienten hat das zusätzliche Sedierungsmonitoring mittels BIS keinen Einfluss auf die verwendete Sedativadosis, die Aufwachzeit oder die Häufigkeit von Komplikationen.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29045997/

The aim of this investigation is to study the superiority of the locally infiltrated anesthetic bupivacaine just before the skull pin insertion and the scalp incision in craniotomy under general anesthesia. Methods In the study thirty patients of both genders aged 24-72 years were included. They were categorized as ASA 1 and 2 and divided into two group of 15 patients each, group B (bupivacaine) and group S (saline). We recorded the bispectral (BIS) index, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the pulse rate (PR) in five time intervals: t 0-2 min before pin insertion; t 1-2 min after pin insertion; t 2-5 min after; t 3-10 min after and t 4-15 min after. Results Significant difference p<0.05 was achieved in group S for all three followed parameters: blood pressure, heart rate and bispectral index. The difference is present in all four time intervals compared to the initial one before the pin insertion. With further analysis it was demonstrated that the investigated BIS index participates the most in the overall significance in group F.

28985693,Assessing the depth of isoflurane anaesthesia during cardiopulmonary bypass.,Perfusion,2018,"Ng KT, Alston RP, Just G, McKenzie C","Bispectral index (BIS) and monitoring of end-tidal concentration may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of awareness during volatile-based general anaesthesia. An analogue of end-tidal concentration during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is measuring exhausted isoflurane concentration from the oxygenator as an estimate to blood and, so, brain concentration. The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between oxygenator exhaust and blood concentrations of isoflurane and the BIS score during CPB when administering isoflurane into the sweep gas supply to the oxygenator.
Seventeen patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery using CPB and isoflurane with BIS monitoring were recruited in a single-centre university hospital. Isoflurane gas was delivered via a calibrated vaporiser at the beginning of anaesthetic induction. Radial arterial blood samples were collected after the initiation of CPB and before aortic cross-clamping, which were analysed for isoflurane by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The BIS score and the concentration of exhausted isoflurane from the oxygenator membrane, as measured by an anaesthetic gas analyser, were recorded at the time of blood sampling.
The mean duration of anaesthetic induction to arterial blood sampling was 90 min (95%CI: 80,100). On CPB, the median BIS was 39 (range, 7-43) and the mean oxygenator exhaust isoflurane concentration was 1.24 ± 0.21%. No significant correlation was demonstrated between BIS with arterial isoflurane concentration (r=-0.19, p=0.47) or oxygenator exhaust isoflurane concentration (r=0.07, p=0.80). Mixed-venous blood temperature was moderately correlated to BIS (r=0.50, p=0.04). Oxygenator exhaust isoflurane concentration was moderately, positively correlated with its arterial concentration (r=0.64, p<0.01).
In conclusion, in patients undergoing heart surgery with CPB, the findings of this study indicate that, whilst oxygenator exhaust concentrations were significantly associated with arterial concentrations of isoflurane, neither had any association with the BIS scores, whereas body temperature has moderate positive correlation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28985693/

Patients (n=150, 18-65 years old, American Society of Anesthesiologists risk group I-III) scheduled undergo elective colonoscopy were included. They were randomized into three groups using the closed envelope methodpropofol-alfentanil (Group A), propofol-fentanyl (Group F), and propofol only (Group P).Group A patients were given an alfentanil (10 mcg/kg)-supplemented propofol bolus infusion and 5 mcg/kg alfentanil when necessary. Group F patients were given fentanyl (1 mcg/kg)-supplemented propofol and 0.5 mcg/kg fentanyl when necessary. Group P patients were given 1 mg/kg propofol and 0.5 mg/kg propofol when necessary. Vital signs, depth of sedation, recovery parameters, and patient and endoscopist satisfaction were recorded. Trieger dot test (TDT) and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) were performed post procedure.
Demographic data were similar among all patients in the groups. Bispectral index values were lower in Group P (p<0.001). DSST scores were higher in Group A (p=0.004). TDT scores and Facial Pain Scale scores were higher in Group P (p<0.005). Apnea incidence (p=0.009) and Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale scores (p=0.002) were also higher in Group P.

Propofol is the favored sedative-hypnotic for many proceduralists but has a narrow therapeutic window and the risk for oversedation is high. Propofol-based sedation administered by anesthesiologists and the routine use of end-tidal capnography and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring may attenuate risks of complications.
The purpose of our study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of monitored anesthesia care for pleuroscopy.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent pleuroscopy. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of anesthesia complications in patients undergoing pleuroscopy. Hypoxia was defined as oxygen saturation of less than 90% for 2 min and hypotension was defined as the need for vasopressors.
Of 199 enrolled patients, there were no significant complications attributed directly to anesthesia. Minor complications included hypoxia in 9 patients (4.5%), hypotension in 76 patients (38.2%), and insertion of a nasopharyngeal tube airway in 2 patients (1.0%). There was no significant difference in anesthesia-related complications between those with BIS monitoring and those without. Lower mean oxygen saturations (p = 0.028) and hypoxia (p = 0.021) were found in patients receiving the combination of propofol plus narcotics plus sedatives compared to those receiving propofol only, propofol plus narcotics or propofol plus sedatives.
Our study demonstrates that pleuroscopy using propofol with end-tidal capnography monitoring, with or without BIS monitoring, is safe and effective. The combination of propofol with narcotics and sedatives is associated with more hypoxia and lower mean oxygen saturation compared with propofol alone, propofol plus narcotics or propofol plus sedatives.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28918427/

Various medical and emotional interventions have been investigated to reduce emergence delirium; however, none are completely effective. This trial intends to assess whether the mother's recorded voice can reduce this adverse post-anesthesia event and facilitate arousal from general anesthesia.
This is a prospective, double-blind, single-center, parallel-arm, superiority, randomized controlled trial to be conducted in participants aged 2-8 years who are undergoing elective surgery requiring general anesthesia. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: those who are stimulated to wake up by listening to their mother's recorded voice (maternal group, n = 33) or a stranger's voice (stranger group, n = 33) during anesthetic emergence. The primary outcome is the initial emergence delirium score in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The secondary outcomes are hemodynamic parameters, including heart rate and mean blood pressure, the duration of time between the cessation of anesthetics and a BIS level of 60, 70 and 80, eye-opening or purposeful movement time, extubation time, total consumption of analgesics, PACU stay time, emergence delirium and pain scores during the PACU stay.
This is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of a mother's recorded voice during emergence on the pediatric emergence profile after general anesthesia. It may provide prophylactic treatment options to decrease emergence delirium and enhance arousal from general anesthesia.

We randomly allocated 120 patients to receive one of three remifentanil target effect-site concentrations (5, 7, or 9 ng×mL-1) during intubation. The target effect-site concentrations of propofol were adjusted within a range of 2.5-3 μg×mL-1 to maintain bispectral index values at less than 60 during anesthesia induction. A reusable SPI sensor was placed on the index finger of the arm, and the SPI values were continuously recorded. The predicted probability for maintaining the SPI values at less than 50 after intubation against the cumulative amount of remifentanil was analyzed using logistic regression. The measurands were the baseline SPI value in patients without pain scheduled for surgery, and the maximal SPI value after intubation in patients receiving remifentanil with a target effect-site concentration of 7 ng×mL-1.
The estimated cumulative amount of remifentanil associated with a 50% and 95% probability of maintaining the SPI values at less than 50 after intubation were 135.0 µg and 330.4 µg, respectively.

Additional serum concentrations of S100β and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were detected during surgery to determine whether they were reliable predictors of POCD.Patients who underwent LT at Beijing YouAn Hospital Affiliated to Capital University of Medical Science from January 2014 to December 2015 were enrolled. BIS monitor was needed during surgery. Patients who underwent LT without BIS monitoring during August 2012 to December 2014 served as historical controls. A battery of 5 neuropsychological tests were performed and scored preoperatively and 7days after surgery. POCD was diagnosed by the method of one standard deviation (SD). The blood samples of BIS group were collected at 5 time points: just before induction of general anesthesia (T0), 60 minutes after skin incision (T1), 30 minutes after the start of the anhepatic phase (T2), 15 minutes after reperfusion of the new liver (T3), and at 24 hours after surgery (T4).A total of 33 patients were included in BIS group, and 27 in the control group. Mean arterial pressure was different between 2 groups at 30 minutes after the start of the anhepatic phase (P = .032). The dose of propofol using at anhepatic phase 30 min and new liver 15 min was lower in the BIS group than control group (0.042 ± 0.021 vs. 0.069 ± 0.030, P < .001; 0.053 ± 0.022 vs. 0.072 ± 0.020, P = .001). Five patients were diagnosed as having POCD after 7 days in the BIS group and the incidence of POCD was 15.15%. In the control group, 9 patients had POCD and the incidence of POCD was 33.33%. The incidence of POCD between 2 groups had no statistical difference (P = .089). S100β increased at stage of anhepatic 30 minutes (T2) and new liver 15 minutes (T3) compared with the stage of before anesthesia (T0) (1.49 ± 0.66 vs. 0.72 ± 0.53, P < .001; 1.92 ± 0.78 vs. 0.72 ± 0.53, P < .001).

At 24 hours after surgery, S100β had no difference compared to one before anesthesia (1.0 ± 0.62 vs. 0.72 ± 0.53, P = .075), but NSE still remained high (5.19 ± 3.64 vs. 3.58 ± 3.24, P = .043). There were no significant differences in the serum concentrations of S100β between patients with and without POCD at 5 time points of operation (P > .05). But at 24 hours after surgery, NSE concentrations were still high of patients with POCD (8.14 ± 3.25 vs. 4.81 ± 3.50, P = .035).BIS-guided anesthesia can reduce consumption of propofol during anhepatic and new liver phase. Patients in BIS group seem to have a mild lower incidence of POCD compared to controls, but no statistical significant. The influence of BIS-guided anesthesia on POCD needs to be further confirmed by large-scale clinical study. S100β protein and NSE are well correlative with neural injury, but NSE is more suitable for assessment of incidence of postoperative cognitive deficits after surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28858130/

Influence of arousal on bispectral index and sedation.,British journal of anaesthesia,2017,"Colin PJ, Hannivoort LN, Eleveld DJ, Reyntjens KMEM, Absalom AR, Vereecke HEM, Struys MMRF","Dexmedetomidine, a selective α 2 -adrenoreceptor agonist, has unique characteristics, such as maintained respiratory drive and production of arousable sedation. We describe development of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine, taking into account the effect of stimulation on its sedative properties.
In a two-period, randomized study in 18 healthy volunteers, dexmedetomidine was delivered in a step-up fashion by means of target-controlled infusion using the Dyck model. Volunteers were randomized to a session without background noise and a session with pre-recorded looped operating room background noise. Exploratory pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling and covariate analysis were conducted in NONMEM using bispectral index (BIS) monitoring of processed EEG.
We found that both stimulation at the time of Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale scoring and the presence or absence of ambient noise had an effect on the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine. The stimuli associated with MOAA/S scoring increased the BIS of sedated volunteers because of a transient 170% increase in the effect-site concentration necessary to reach half of the maximal effect. In contrast, volunteers deprived of ambient noise were more resistant to dexmedetomidine and required, on average, 32% higher effect-site concentrations for the same effect as subjects who were exposed to background operating room noise.
The new pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models might be used for effect-site rather than plasma concentration target-controlled infusion for dexmedetomidine in clinical practice, thereby allowing tighter control over the desired level of sedation.

Only a small proportion of elective postoperative neurosurgical patients require specific medical interventions and invasive monitoring. Among these, patients undergoing elective craniotomy are frequently admitted to neuro-ICU, specialist postanaesthesia care units or intermediate-level care unit in the postoperative period.Craniotomy patients have a high risk of neurological complications in the immediate postoperative period and might require advanced neuromonitoring, especially if sedation is continued in the ICU.Furthermore, the concept of enhanced recovery after surgery with the goal of improving functional capacity after surgery and decreasing morbidity has expanded to encompass neurosurgery.Postoperative clinical examination and neurological scores, bispectral index and simplified electroencephalography, and morning discharge huddles are the most used strategies in this context.
After elective craniotomy, ICU admission should be warranted to patients who show new neurological deficits, especially when these include reduced consciousness or deficits of the lower cranial nerves, or have surgical indication for delayed extubation. Currently, evidence does not allow defining standardized protocol to guide ICU admission and postoperative neuromonitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28682828/
28675953,Utility of nociceptive flexion reflex threshold and bispectral index to predict movement responses under propofol anaesthesia.,Somatosensory & motor research,2017,"Jakuscheit A, Posch MJ, Gkaitatzis S, Neumark L, Hackbarth M, Schneider M, Lichtner G, Baars JH, von Dincklage F","The nociceptive flexion reflex threshold (NFRT) is a promising tool to monitor analgesia during general anaesthesia. Clinical studies have shown that the NFRT allows to predict movement responses to painful stimuli under a combined anaesthetic regime of sedative and opioid agents. Experimental studies indicated that the NFRT is also able to predict such movement responses under an exclusively sedative regime like propofol mono-anaesthesia. Therefore, we performed this study to investigate the ability of the NFRT to predict movement responses to painful stimuli in patients during a clinical propofol mono-anaesthesia.
We investigated 140 cardiac surgery patients during their postoperative phase under propofol mono-anaesthesia. NFRT and bispectral index (BIS) were determined in each patient right before endotracheal suctioning or painful electrical test stimulation. Prediction probabilities were calculated to quantify how accurate each measure is able to predict movement responses to the stimuli.
The 124 patients included in the analysis received a median propofol dosage of 3.2 (2.5-3.9) [median (IQR)] mg/kg/h. The included patients showed 287 movement responses after a total of 725 investigated stimuli. The prediction probabilities for positive movement responses were 0.63 (95%CI: 0.59-0.67) for the NFRT and 0.69 (95%CI: 0.65-0.73) for the BIS.
The NFRT allows the prediction of movement responses under propofol mono-anaesthesia, which confirms its utility as a monitor to predict movement responses under general anaesthesia. The BIS allows an even more accurate prediction, although it does not reflect the physiological structures of movement suppression, but correlates closely with the dose of propofol.

However, the effect of chronic opioid exposure on minimum alveolar concentration of inhalation agents remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the concentration of sevoflurane necessary to maintain a bispectral index (BIS) <50 (SEVOBIS50) in patients with chronic opioid use compared with those naïve to opioid use.
We included chronic opioid users who received a stable dose of oral morphine of at least 60 mg/d according to the morphine equivalent daily dose for at least 4 weeks and opioid-naïve patients. General anesthesia that included thiopental, vecuronium, and sevoflurane in oxygen was administered to all patients. Anesthesia was maintained using predetermined end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations. Fifteen minutes after achieving the determined end-tidal sevoflurane concentration through closed circuit anesthesia, BIS was measured for 1 minute in both groups. SEVOBIS50 was determined using Dixon's up-down method and probit analysis.
Nineteen and 18 patients from the chronic opioid and control groups, respectively, were included in the final analysis. SEVOBIS50values for the chronic opioid and control patients were 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.11) and 1.18 (95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.40), respectively (P = .0346).

28611364,Association of Polymorphisms in Pharmacogenetic Candidate Genes with Propofol Susceptibility.,Scientific reports,2017,"Zhong Q, Chen X, Zhao Y, Liu R, Yao S","Significant individual susceptibility to intravenous anesthetic propofol exists. The etiology of individual variability in the response to propofol may be influenced by genetic polymorphisms in metabolic and functional pathways. With current pharmacogenetics and modern molecular biology technologies, it is possible to study the influence of genetic polymorphisms on susceptibility to propofol. When inducing general anesthesia with intravenous propofol, high individual susceptibility to propofol was found. Using Sequenom MassARRAY single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, we identified a mutation (rs6313) in the 5HT2A gene that was correlated to individual susceptibility to propofol effect-site concentration (Cep) and onset time of propofol induction. Carriers of the minor allele (G) of 5HT2A rs6313 required less propofol (20% decrease in Cep) and less time (40% decrease in onset time) to induce anesthesia. Moreover, associations were found between the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor SNP rs2279020 and the SCN9A SNP rs6746030 and the susceptibility of bispectral index (BIS) after propofol-induced anesthesia. In addition, dominant mutations in GABAA1 rs2279020, GABAA2 rs11503014, and CHRM2 rs1824024 were putatively associated with cardiovascular susceptibility to propofol anesthesia. No gene-gene interactions were found through a standardized measure of linkage disequilibrium and a multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis.

As xenon exerts its organ protective properties even in subanesthetic concentrations, we hypothesized that in patients undergoing OPCAB surgery, 30% xenon added to general anesthesia with propofol results in superior hemodynamic stability when compared to anesthesia with propofol alone.
Fifty patients undergoing elective OPCAB surgery were randomized to receive general anesthesia with 30% xenon adjuvant to a target-controlled infusion of propofol or with propofol alone. The primary end point was the total intraoperative dose of norepinephrine required to maintain an intraoperative mean arterial pressure >70 mm Hg. Secondary outcomes included the perioperative cardiorespiratory profile and the incidence of adverse and serious adverse events.
Adding xenon to propofol anesthesia resulted in a significant reduction of norepinephrine required to attain the predefined hemodynamic goals (cumulative intraoperative dose: median [interquartile range]: 370 [116-570] vs 840 [335-1710] µg, P = .001). In the xenon-propofol group, significantly less propofol was required to obtain a similar depth of anesthesia as judged by clinical signs and the bispectral index (propofol effect site concentration [mean ± SD]: 1.8 ± 0.5 vs 2.8 ± 0.3 mg, P≤ .0001).

We anesthetized 38 patients with propofol and increasing doses of remifentanil and applied standardized tetanic and intracutaneous electrical painful stimulations on each analgesic level. Baseline and Δ values of the Analgesia Nociception Index, the Surgical Pleth Index, pupillary dilatation, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and bispectral index and their relation to remifentanil doses were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curves, prediction probability (PK), and mixed-model analysis.
Under propofol sedation, sensitivity and specificity of the Analgesia Nociception Index (PK = 0.98), the Surgical Pleth Index (PK = 0.87), and pupillary dilatation (PK = 0.98) for detecting both painful stimulations were high compared to heart rate (PK = 0.74), mean arterial pressure (PK = 0.75), and bispectral index (PK = 0.55). Baseline values had limited prediction probability toward the nociceptive response (Analgesia Nociception Index: PK = 0.7; Surgical Pleth Index: PK = 0.63; pupillary dilatation: PK = 0.67; and bispectral index: PK = 0.67). The remifentanil dose had an effect (P < 0.001) on all parameters except for bispectral index (P = 0.216).
The Analgesia Nociception Index, the Surgical Pleth Index, and pupillary dilatation are superior in detecting painful stimulations compared to heart rate and mean arterial pressure but had limited predictive value.

To investigate the degree of change in the BIS in patients receiving anesthesia with suxamethonium, we performed a prospective observational study of 63 participants who underwent closed reduction for nasal bone fracture. Anesthesia was induced by the total intravenous administration of anesthetics and 1.5 mg kg of suxamethonium was injected intravenously upon achieving BIS between 45 and 55. Intubation was performed after fasciculation. Electromyograms and BIS values were recorded from the induction of suxamethonium until 15 minutes after intubation.

Determination of quasi-periodicities in electroencephalogram (EEG) is a candidate for quantifying the changes in the depth of anesthesia (DOA). In this paper, DOA monitoring capacity of periodicities detected using PRSA was quantified by assessing EEG signals collected from 56 patients during surgery. The method is compared with sample entropy (SampEn), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and permutation entropy (PE). The performance of quasi-periodicities defined by deceleration capacity and acceleration capacity was tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Pearson correlation coefficient. During the surgery, a significant difference ( ) in the quasi-periodicities was observed among three different stages under general anesthesia. There is a larger mean AUC and correlation coefficient of quasi-periodicities compared with SampEn, DFA, and PE using expert assessment of conscious level and bispectral index as the gold standard, respectively.

The depth of sedation may influence patient recovery. Therefore, we investigated the influence of peripheral nerve blockade and different intraoperative sedation levels on the short-term recovery of elderly patients receiving total hip arthroplasty.
Patients aged 65 years and older undergoing total hip arthroplasty were randomized into 3 groups: a general anesthesia without lumbosacral plexus block group, and 2 general anesthesia plus lumbosacral plexus block groups, each with a different level of sedation (light or deep). The extubation time and intraoperative consumption of propofol, sufentanil, and vasoactive agent were recorded. Postoperative delirium and early postoperative cognitive dysfunction were assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method and Mini-Mental State Examination, respectively. Postoperative analgesia was assessed by the consumption of patient-controlled analgesics and visual analog scale scores. Discharge time and complications over a 30-day period were also recorded.
Lumbosacral plexus block reduced opioid intake. With lumbosacral plexus block, intraoperative deep sedation was associated with greater intake of propofol and vasoactive agent. In contrast, patients with lumbosacral plexus block and intraoperative light sedation had lower incidences of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive decline, and earlier discharge readiness times. The 3 groups showed no difference in complications within 30 days of surgery.
Lumbosacral plexus block reduced the need for opioids and offered satisfactory postoperative analgesia. It led to better postoperative outcomes in combination with intraoperative light sedation (high bispectral index).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28383293/

In this single-center retrospective control analysis, clinical data, including demographic characteristics, echocardiography, periprocedural data, and main complications, were collected and assessed in 113 patients undergoing TAVI through the femoral artery under general anesthesia (GA group, n=36) and under BIS-guided sedation (SED group, n=77).
The demographic characteristics and echocardiographic parameters between the two groups were similar (P>0.05). Two (2.6%) of patients were moved from BIS-guided sedation to general anesthesia for surgical reasons. Procedures were significantly shorter in the SED group than in the GA group ((127.10±44.43) min vs. (165.90±71.62) min, P=0.004). Patients in the SED group lost less blood and received significantly fewer red blood cells and catecholamines than those in the GA group (5.19% vs. 22.22%, P=0.017 and 67.53% vs. 97.22%, P<0.001). The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter and there were fewer pulmonary complications in the SED group than in the GA group. Thirty-day mortality was similar between the two groups.
BIS-guided sedation is a feasible and safe approach for transfemoral TAVI. The anesthesiologist should choose the best anesthetic method according to the team's experience.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28378573/

Therefore, reducing postoperative morbidity and mortality is a major concern in medical research and practice. Dependence on caregivers and cognitive impairment represent two major risk factors in the elderly, especially in frail patients after surgery under general anesthesia. In this context, continuous monitoring of the depth of anesthesia using a bispectral index (BIS) sensor may reduce the occurrence of impairments by gaining better control of the anesthetic depth. The first aim of this study is to compare manual versus automated administration of intravenous anesthetics with regard to 6-month functional decline in persons aged 70 years and older. The secondary objective includes an evaluation of the influence of the frail phenotype on self-sufficiency in elderly patients after general anesthesia.
After receiving ethical committee approval and written consent, a complete preoperative assessment of physiological reserve and self-sufficiency will be performed on patients more than 70 years old who are scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia. This evaluation will determine the patient's frailty status in three categories: robust, pre-frail, and frail. Then, patients will be randomized into two groups: manual administration of anesthetics guided by BIS sensor (manual group) or automated administration (automated group) with recording of the anesthesia. A second examination will be scheduled after 6 months to assess changes in functional abilities, cognitive functions, and frailty status. A priori calculation of sample size gives a population of 430 patients to be included in this multicenter trial.
This clinical study is designed to detect any postoperative complications and deaths related to the performance of the general anesthesia guided by the BIS sensor and the preoperative functional status of the elderly: robust, pre-frail, or frail.

One hundred forty-four GBC patients were selected and randomly divided into the general anesthesia (GA) group and the combined epidural-general anesthesia (CEGA) group. Before anesthesia induction (t0), at intubation (t1), at the beginning of surgery (t2), 5 minutes after pneumoperitoneum (t3), at the end of surgery (t4), after recovery of spontaneous breathing (t5), after regaining consciousness (t6), and after extubation (t7), the heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and the depth of anesthesia (bispectral index [BIS]) were detected. Blood samples were separately collected 30 minutes before anesthesia induction (T1), 2 hours after the beginning of surgery (T2), at the end of surgery (T3), 1 day after surgery (T4), 3 days after surgery (T5). The survival rates of T cell subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+) and natural killer (NK) cells were determined by flow cytometry. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), visual analog scale (VAS), and sedation-agitation scale (SAS) were performed to assess postoperative adverse reactions. A 3-year follow-up was conducted.
Compared with the GA group, the CEGA group had significant lower SBP values at t5 and t6, lower DBP values at t1, t3, t4, and t5, lower HR values at t1 and t5, and higher BIS values at t4, t5, t6, and t7. No PONV was observed in the CEGA group. In comparison to the GA group, the VAS was markedly increased and survival rates of CD3+, CD4+, and CD4+/CD8+ cells were increased at T2, T3, T4, and T5 in the CEGA group. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates were not evidently different between the CEGA group and the GA group.
Our study provides evidence that the combined epidural-general anesthesia might attenuate intraoperative hemodynamic responses and improve postoperative cellular immunity, so that it might be a more available anesthesia method for GBC patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28272202/

We concurrently recorded BIS and entropy (SE/RE) in 48 children aged 1 month-12 years, undergoing general anesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl. Nonlinear mixed effects modeling was used to characterize the concentration-response relationship independently between the three monitor indicators with sevoflurane.

We aimed to compare the time course during surgery in SPI values in patients receiving nicardipine or remifentanil infusion during thyroidectomy.
Forty patients undergoing thyroidectomy were randomly assigned to receive nicardipine (group N; n = 19) or remifentanil (group R; n = 21) along with induction (propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium) and maintenance (50% desflurane/nitrous oxide in oxygen) anesthesia (goal bispectral index [BIS] ∼50). The infusion of nicardipine or remifentanil was started before the 1st incision and adjusted to keep mean blood pressure (MBP) within ±20% of the preoperative value. SPI, BIS, end-tidal desflurane concentration (EtDes), MBP, and heart rate were recorded at 2.5 minute intervals from the 1st incision to the end of surgery. Extubation and recovery times, pain score/rescue ketorolac consumption, and adverse events in postanesthesia care unit (PACU) were recorded.
The trend of SPI during surgery was comparable between the 2 groups (P = 0.804), although the heart rates in group N were significantly higher than those in group R (P = 0.040). The patient characteristics, trends of BIS, EtDes, and MBP during surgery, extubation and recovery times, and incidence of nausea/vomiting were comparable between the groups. Group N had significantly lower pain scores and rescue ketorolac consumption at PACU.
SPI was comparable between patients receiving nicardipine or remifentanil infusion during thyroidectomy under general anesthesia, which suggests that the administration of nicardipine may confound the interpretation of SPI values during general anesthesia.

EEG data were replayed to BIS and qCON with an EEG player. We calculated the Spearman correlation to evaluate similarities in index trend behavior and estimated the general index agreement of displaying the same anesthetic level, i.e., wakefulness, sedation and anesthesia. We used coughing episodes and the bronchoscope placement to investigate the index for possible arousal reactions.
We found a high to very high correlation of the indices' trend during the procedure. Furthermore, qCON was significantly lower than BIS and SE. All indices increased significantly after bronchoscope placement and coughing. The agreement of BIS/SE was 68% and around 50% for BIS/qCON and qCON/SE.

This technique has been used to monitor the balance between analgesia and nociception. Under general anesthesia, the amplitude of pupillary dilation is related to the amount of administered opioids. The objective of this study was to determine whether at a constant infusion rate of opioids, the pupillary response was influenced by depth of hypnosis assessed by the bispectral index (BIS).
Twelve patients (14-20 years) anesthetized for orthopedic surgery were included. Under propofol-remifentanil target-controlled infusion, remifentanil effect site target concentration was fixed at 1 ng/mL. Two measures of pupillary reflex dilation were performed on each patient in a randomized order: one at BIS 55 and one at BIS 25. These levels of BIS were obtained by adjusting propofol target concentration and maintained for 10 minutes before each measure. For each measure, we applied a standardized tetanic stimulation on the patient's forearm (60 mA, 100 Hz, 5 seconds). All measures were performed before the beginning of surgery.

The objective of the randomized controlled trial ""A STrategy to Reduce the Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients"" (STRIDE) is to assess the effectiveness of light versus heavy sedation on delirium and other outcomes in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture repair surgery. Our goal is to describe the design considerations and lessons learned in planning and implementing the STRIDE trial. Methods Discussed are challenges encountered including (1) how to ensure that we quickly identify, assess the eligibility of, and randomize traumatic hip fracture patients; (2) how to implement interventions that involve continuous monitoring and adjustment during the surgery; and (3) how to measure and ascertain the primary outcome, delirium. Results To address the first challenge, we monitored the operating room schedule more actively than anticipated. We constructed and organized eligibility assessment data collection forms by purpose and by source of information needed to complete them. We decided that randomization needs to take place in the operating room. To address the second challenge, we designed and implemented a treatment protocol and covered the bispectral index monitor to prevent the Anesthesiologist/Anesthetist from being influenced by the bispectral index reading while administering the intervention. Finally, clinical assessment of delirium consisted of standardized interviews of the patient using validated instruments, interviews of those caring for the patient, and review of the medical record. A consensus panel made the final determination of a delirium diagnosis. We note that STRIDE is a single-center trial. The decisions we took may have different implications for multi-center trials.

The doses are determined somewhat empirically and adjustments are based on clinical assessment and observational measures of sedation and comfort. Following reports that these observational measures could be misleading, this study assesses their validity by comparing them with an objective measure of sedation, the Bispectral Index Score (BIS).
The objective of this study was to determine the validity of the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) and the Patient Comfort Score (PCS) in assessing sedation and comfort in unconscious patients.
Forty eligible and consenting patients were monitored from the onset of unconsciousness (unresponsiveness) until death. Measures of sedation (RASS) and comfort (PCS) were made by the attending nurse every four hours. Correlation coefficients examined the relationship between fourth hourly RASS and PCS and time-matched BISs.
A significant correlation was found between RASS and BIS and PCS and BIS. Sedation and comfort scores were concentrated at the lower end of the respective scales, whereas time-matched BISs were widely scattered with scores ranging from near full awareness to deep sedation.
Compared with BIS, both RASS and PCS appear to be relatively blunt instruments at the lower end of their respective scales.

The calculated effect site concentration (Ce) of midazolam applied by TCI, BIS, heart rate (HR), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were monitored continuously. Non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured every 10 minutes. All peri-operative parameters were recorded every 10 minutes. All patients were interviewed 1 week after the procedure to explore their experience of sedation and the periodontal or implant surgery procedure.
Extensive periodontal or implant surgery treatment in all 30 patients was completed in a mean time of 120 min (range 50-180 min). The calculated mean effect site concentration for midazolam was 50 ng/ml (range 24-80). The mean BIS was 85 (74-100) during induction and was maintained between 80 and 90 during the oral surgical procedure by adjusting TCI Ce. There were no clinically significant cardiopulmonary changes during midazolam infusion with regard to SpO2, NIBP, MAP and heart rate.

Power spectral analysis is an important method for feature detection in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Several spectral parameters derived from EEG have been proposed for measuring DOA in clinical applications. In the present paper, an improved method based on phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) is designed to improve the predictive accuracy of relative alpha and beta power, a frequency band power ratio, total power, median frequency (MF), spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), and spectral entropy for assessing anesthetic drug effects. Fifty-six patients undergoing general anesthesia in an operating theatre are studied. All EEG signals are continuously recorded from the awake state to the end of the recovery state and then filtered using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). All parameters are evaluated using the commercial bispectral index (BIS) and expert assessment of conscious level (EACL), respectively. The ability to predict DOA is estimated using the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). All indicators based on the improved method can clearly discriminate the conscious state from the anesthetized state after filtration (p  <  0.05). A significantly larger mean AUC (p  <  0.05) shows that the improved method performs better than the conventional method to measure the DOA in most circumstances. Especially for raw EEG contaminated by artifacts, when the BIS index is used to indicate the consciousness level, the improvement is 7.37% (p  <  0.05), 9.04% (p  <  0.05), 18.46% (p  <  0.05), 27.73% (p  <  0.05), 14.65% (p  <  0.05), 2.52%, 5.38% and 6.24% (p  <  0.05) for relative alpha and beta power, power ratio, total power, MF, SEF, RE and SE, respectively.

No study has used automated sedation in extremely frail patients, such as those scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We developed and tested a novel automated sedation system for this kind of population and surgery. The system integrates a decision support system that detects respiratory and hemodynamic events via smart alarms, which provide pertinent/related clinical suggestions and treatment options. The main objective was the feasibility of closed-loop sedation, defined as successful automated sedation without manual override. Secondary qualitative observations were clinical and controller performance.
Twenty patients scheduled for elective TAVI were enrolled. Sedation was administered via a closed-loop delivery system designed for propofol. The clinical performance of sedation was the efficacy to maintain a bispectral index (BIS) of 65. To evaluate the sedation performance, BIS values were stratified into 4 categories: excellent, very good, good, and inadequate sedation control, defined as BIS values within 10%, ranging from 11% to 20%, ranging from 21% to 30%, or >30% from the target value, respectively. The controller performance was calculated using Varvel parameters. Critical respiratory and hemodynamic events were documented. The former was defined as peripheral oxygen saturation <92% and/or respiratory rate <8/min, whereas the latter was considered a mean arterial pressure <60 mm Hg and/or heart rate <40 bpm.
Automated sedation was successful in 19 patients undergoing TAVI. One patient was excluded from the final analysis because of conversion to general anesthesia. The secondary observations revealed that the clinical performance allowed an excellent to good control during 69% (99% confidence interval, 53%-77%; interquartile range, 59%-79%) of the sedation time. Fifteen patients presented critical respiratory episodes, with a median of 3 events per hour of sedation. Six patients presented critical hemodynamic episodes, with a median of 2 events per hour of procedure.

The BIS was monitored for 24 hours and compared with the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) evaluated every 4 hours. Deep sedation was defined as a RASS of -3 to -5. Threshold values of baseline BIS (the lowest value before RASS assessment) and stimulated BIS (the highest value after standardized assessment) for detecting deep sedation were determined in a training set (45 patients, 262 RASS assessments). Diagnostic accuracy was then analyzed in a validation set (45 patients, 264 RASS assessments).
Deep sedation was only prescribed in 6 (6.7%) patients, but 76 patients (84.4%) had at least 1 episode of deep sedation. Thresholds for detecting deep sedation of 50 for baseline and 80 for stimulated BIS were identified, with respective areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.771 (95% confidence interval, 0.714-0.828) and 0.805 (0.752-0.857).

28017174,Benefit of general anesthesia monitored by bispectral index compared with monitoring guided only by clinical parameters. Systematic review and meta-analysis.,Brazilian journal of anesthesiology (Elsevier),2017,"Oliveira CR, Bernardo WM, Nunes VM","The bispectral index parameter is used to guide the titration of general anesthesia; however, many studies have shown conflicting results regarding the benefits of bispectral index monitoring. The objective of this systematic review with meta-analysis is to evaluate the clinical impact of monitoring with the bispectral index parameter.
The search for evidence in scientific information sources was conducted during December 2013 to January 2015, the following primary databases: Medline/PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane, CINAHL, Ovid, SCOPUS and TESES. The criteria for inclusion in the study were randomized controlled trials, comparing general anesthesia monitored, with bispectral index parameter with anesthesia guided solely by clinical parameters, and patients aged over 18 years. The criteria for exclusion were studies involving anesthesia or sedation for diagnostic procedures, and intraoperative wake-up test for surgery of the spine.
The use of monitoring with the bispectral index has shown benefits reducing time to extubation, orientation in time and place, and discharge from both the operating room and post anesthetic care unit. The risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery was reduced by 12% in patients monitored with bispectral index. Occurred a reduction of 3% in the risk of cognitive impairment postoperatively at 3 months postoperatively and 6% reduction in the risk of postoperative delirium in patients monitored with bispectral index. Furthermore, the risk of intraoperative memory has been reduced by 1%.
Clinically, anesthesia monitoring with the BIS can be justified because it allows advantages from reducing the recovery time after waking, mainly by reducing the administration of general anesthetics as well as the risk of adverse events.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28017174/

Accumulated saliva is one of the predisposing factors for coughing. Body movements during dental sedation appear to enhance salivation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the difference in salivary secretion between the with-movements state and the without-movements state during sedation. Salivary weight for 1 min was measured 3 times in 27 patients with intellectual disability during dental treatment under deep sedation with midazolam and propofol. The observed variables were body movements, bispectral index (BIS), and predicted propofol effect-site concentration. A total of 81 measurements were classified into the with-movements state (n = 39; ie, measurements during which body movements were observed) or the without-movements state (n = 42; ie, measurements during which no body movements were observed). The median salivary weight was significantly smaller in the without-movements state compared with the with-movements state (0.03 vs 0.11 g, P < .0001). The BIS was significantly lower in the without-movements state. There was no significant difference in the predicted propofol effect-site concentration between the 2 states. Significant correlation was observed between salivary weight and BIS in the with-movements state (r = 0.44, P = .004). The findings indicate that salivary secretion decreased according to deep sedation. Furthermore, immobility also reduced salivary secretion. We concluded that one reason that immobility is beneficial is because of the resulting decreased salivary secretion during dental treatment under deep sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27973943/

In these cases, surgery would be postponed if the choice was neuroaxial anesthesia, particularly because of P2Y12 receptor inhibitors' effect. FIB puncture site is distal to the fracture and incision site, but proximal local anesthetic migration through the interfascial planes allows for constant block of femoral nerve and lateral cutaneous of femur nerve and, less constantly, block of obturator. FIB may reduce the risk of perineural hematoma associated with several injections in nerve vicinity of different lumbar plexus branches. Frequently, indications for extramedullary or IMF are overlapping, but IMF is associated with less blood loss and may be managed using a low anesthetic depth if an FIB is done, increasing safety. This way, these less invasive surgical techniques combined with an adjusted anesthetic technique may have a crucial role in high-risk patients, particularly if taking P2Y12 receptor inhibitors.

The aim of this study was to compare polygraphy (PG) performed on sedated patients during surgery to overnight polysomnography (PSG). It was hypothesized that perioperative PG may be used to diagnose OSA.
Overnight PSG was performed three days prior to surgery. For surgery, spinal anesthesia and sedation with propofol infusion were used. Sedation depth was monitored by the Bispectral index and maintained for all patients (target level 75). Echocardiography studies were available in three patients, and all were diagnosed with diastolic dysfunction. Relatively high prevalence of CSA in patients with diastolic dysfunction has been previously reported. During surgery, PG recording (Embletta) was performed. Sleep apnea was defined by the type (central/obstructive apnea ≥50%) and by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (events/hour: AHI < 5 no apnea; 5 ≤ AHI < 15 mild apnea; 15 ≤ AHI < 30 moderate apnea; AHI ≥30 severe apnea). Bland-Altman plots were used for analysis, and 2 × 2 decision statistics were calculated for several cut-off values of the AHI. Data were shown as bias with limits of agreement (bias±1.96 standard deviations).
Nineteen subjects were studied: nine (47%) were diagnosed with obstructive, seven (37%) with central sleep apnea, and three (16%) with no sleep apnea by overnight PSG. Perioperative PG bias was 12 (-37; 61) for AHI; 6 (-25; 37) for obstructive apnea; 0 (-4; 4) for central apnea, and 6 (-31; 43) for hypopnea. For the detection of OSA, a PG cut-off value of AHI 5 yielded 89% sensitivity and 60% specificity, AHI 15 yielded 86% sensitivity and 67% specificity, and AHI 30 yielded 100% sensitivity and 71% specificity.

Obesity is considered as one of the factors increasing the probability of intraoperative awareness due to problems with the dosing of anaesthetics. In a randomized prospective study we compared bispectral index (BIS) recordings during propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and sevoflurane-based inhalation anaesthesia in morbidly obese patients as a sign of possible intraoperative awareness.
120 morbidly obese patients were randomly allocated into two subgroups: TIVA or SEVO. Propofol TIVA was performed following the Servin formula, while sevoflurane was administered based on the age of the patients. The physician administering anaesthesia was blinded to the BIS recordings while the evaluation of the depth of anaesthesia was conducted based on the clinical symptoms of adequate anaesthesia. BIS recordings were evaluated for periods of BIS > 60. Blinded structured interviews were conducted 2 hours after anaesthesia was administrated.
The incidence of BIS > 60 occurred in 90% vs. 91.67% of patients while the mean duration of periods of BIS > 60 was 13.74 ± 21.74% vs. 14.21 ± 18.78% of the duration of anaesthesia in TIVA and SEVO groups, respectively (P > 0.05). There was no correlation between the BMI value and the duration of elevated BIS values observed during anaesthesia in both studied methods of anaesthesia, nor between the total time of anaesthesia and the duration of elevated BIS values above 60 in this study. No patient complained of intraoperative awareness when asked in the post-operative period, probably due to the administration of midasolam.

MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred and sixteen adult patients were randomly assigned to receive either midazolam (midazolam group; n=58) or dexmedetomidine (dexmedetomidine group; n=58) during spinal anesthesia. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures; heart rates; peripheral oxygen saturations; and bispectral index scores were recorded during surgery, and Ramsay sedation scores and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay were monitored. RESULTS Hypotension occurred more frequently in the midazolam group (P<0.001) and bradycardia occurred more frequently in the dexmedetomidine group (P<0.001). Mean Ramsay sedation score was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group after arrival in the PACU (P=0.025) and PACU stay was significantly longer in the dexmedetomidine group (P=0.003).

Patients were categorized into 3 groups: music, isolation, and control. During the procedures, the patients in the music group listened to Vivaldi's The Four Seasons violin concertos by sound-isolating headphones, whereas the patients in the isolation group wore the headphones but did not listen to music. All patients were sedated by 0.1 mg/kg midazolam and 1 mg/kg propofol. During the procedure, an additional 0.5 mg/kg propofol was administered as required.
Bispectral index was used for quantifying the depth of sedation, and total dosage of the propofol was used for sedative requirements. The patients' heart rates, oxygen saturations, and Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale and bispectral index scores, which were monitored during the operation, were similar among the groups. In terms of the amount of propofol used, the groups were similar. Prolonged postoperative recovery cases were found to be significantly frequent in the control group, according to the recovery duration measurements (P = .004).
Listening to music or providing sound isolation during pediatric dental interventions did not alter the sedation level, amount of medication, and hemodynamic variables significantly.

This can be achieved by the simultaneous administration of an analgesic (e.g. remifentanil) and an hypnotic (eg propofol). As a contribution to the effort of automating the processes of drug delivery in general anesthesia, in this paper, a positive state observer is designed for the implementation of a control scheme proposed for the automatic administration of propofol and of remifentanil, in order to track a desired level for the BIS. It is proved and illustrated by simulations that the controller-observer scheme has a very good performance. This scheme was implemented, tested and evaluated both by means of simulations and for a set of patients during surgical procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27647647/

This anesthesia drug delivery robot integrates all 3 components of general anesthesia: hypnosis, analgesia, and muscle relaxation.
Twenty patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled. Propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium were administered using closed-loop feedback control. The main objective was the feasibility of closed-loop anesthesia defined as successful automated cardiac anesthesia without manual override by the attending anesthesiologist. Secondary qualitative observations were clinical and controller performances. The clinical performance of hypnosis control was the efficacy to maintain a bispectral index (BIS) of 45. To evaluate the hypnosis performance, BIS values were stratified into 4 categories: ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""poor,"" and ""inadequate"" hypnosis control defined as BIS values within 10%, ranging from 11% to 20%, ranging from 21% to 30%, or >30% of the target value, respectively. The clinical performance of analgesia was the efficacy to maintain NociMap values close to 0. The analgesia performance was assessed classifying the NociMap values in 3 pain control groups: -33 to +33 representing excellent pain control, -34 to -66 and +34 to +66 representing good pain control, and -67 to -100 and +67 to +100 representing insufficient pain control. The controller performance was calculated using the Varvel parameters.
Robotic anesthesia was successful in 16 patients, which is equivalent to 80% (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 53%-95%) of the patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Four patients were excluded from the final analysis because of technical problems with the automated anesthesia delivery system. The secondary qualitative observations revealed that the clinical performance of hypnosis allowed an excellent and good control during 70% (97.5% CI, 63%-76%) of maintenance time and an insufficient clinical performance of analgesia for only 3% (97.5% CI, 1%-6%) of maintenance time.
The completely automated closed-loop system tested in this investigation could be used successfully and safely for cardiac surgery necessitating cardiopulmonary bypass. The results of the present trial showed satisfactory clinical performance of anesthesia control.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27644009/

Monitoring by means of the bispectral index (BIS) has shown its utility in reducing the use of drugs and their adverse events in general anesthesia, but evidence in prolonged sedation is insufficient.
Our objective was to evaluate BIS in patients undergoing endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS).
A randomized cohort study of 90 patients with mediastinal lymph node involvement and/or lung or mediastinal lesions for whom EBUS was indicated, comparing the modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale clinical evaluation (n = 45) versus the BIS evaluation (n = 45) of sedation with propofol-remifentanil, was conducted in order to evaluate the clinical parameters, doses used, adverse events, and tolerance of the procedure.
We found a shorter waking time and a significantly lower dose of total propofol in the BIS group. Significantly fewer overall adverse events were recorded in the BIS group and included desaturation, hypotension, and bradypnea. Tolerance was better in the BIS group. No significant differences were found in terms of cough, memory of the procedure, or the level of difficulty of EBUS on the part of the pulmonologists.
BIS monitoring of sedation in EBUS makes it possible to reduce the dosage of propofol, thereby shortening the waking time and reducing adverse events. This form of monitoring should be taken into consideration in the future for systematic use in prolonged sedation, as in the case of EBUS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27598398/

Several reports have investigated the effect of SPI on the consumption of opioids including remifentanil, fentanyl, and sufentanil during anesthesia, but there are no reports about oxycodone. We aimed to investigate intravenous oxycodone consumption between SPI-guided analgesia and conventional analgesia practices during sevoflurane anesthesia in patients undergoing thyroidectomy.
Forty-five patients undergoing elective thyroidectomy were randomly assigned to an SPI group (SPI-guided analgesia group, n = 23) or a control group (conventional analgesia group, n = 22). Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane to achieve bispectral index values between 40 and 60. In the SPI group, oxycodone 1 mg was administered intravenously at SPI values over 50; in the control group, oxycodone 1 mg was administered intravenously at the occurrence of tachycardia or hypertension event. Intraoperative oxycodone consumption and extubation time were recorded. The number of hemodynamic and somatic movement events was recorded, as were postoperative pain and recovery scores.
Patients' characteristics were comparable between the groups. Intraoperative oxycodone consumption in the SPI group was significantly lower than the control group (3.5 ± 2.4 vs 5.1 ± 2.4 mg; P = 0.012). Extubation time was significantly shorter in the SPI group (10.6 ± 3.5 vs 13.4 ± 4.6 min; P = 0.026). Hemodynamic and somatic movement events during anesthesia were comparable between the groups, as were numeric rating scales for pain and modified Aldrete scores at postanesthesia care unit.

Considering the limited literature that describes the PK of etomidate in pediatric patients, especially in those with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), our aim was to characterize the PK of etomidate and explore the effects of TOF.
Twenty-nine pediatric patients (15 with TOF and 14 with normal cardiac anatomy) scheduled to undergo elective surgery under general anesthesia were recruited in the study. All children received etomidate 60 μg/kg/min intravenously until a bispectral index of ≤50 was reached for 5 seconds during anesthesia induction. Arterial blood samples were drawn and analyzed. Population analysis was performed by using NONMEM to define PK characteristics. The estimates were standardized to a 70-kg adult using a per-kilogram model.
Data consisting of 244 samples from 29 children with a mean age of 236 days (range, 86-360 days) were used, including a TOF group with a mean age of 250 days (range, 165-360 days) and a normal cardiac anatomy group with a mean age of 221 days (range, 86-360 days). A 3-compartment disposition model was best fitted to describe the PK of etomidate. The introduction of TOF as a covariate for systemic clearance (Cl1) improved the model and resulted in a significant reduction of objective function (Δobjective function = -7.33; P = .0068), which means that TOF was a significant covariate of Cl1, and the etomidate Cl1 in children with TOF (1.67 × (weight [WT]/70 kg) L/min) was lower than those with normal cardiac anatomy (2.28 × (WT/70 kg) L/min). Other PK parameter values were as follows: V1 = 8.05 × (WT/70 kg) L; V2 = 13.7 × (WT/70 kg) L; V3 = 41.3 × (WT/70 kg) L; Cl2 = 3.35 × (WT/70 kg) L/min; Cl3 = 0.563 × (WT/70 kg) L/min.
A decreased systemic clearance for etomidate in children with TOF resulted in a lower required infusion rate and variation with time to achieve the same plasma concentration and maintain an equivalent target concentration or have longer sedation and recovery times after bolus or continuous infusion than normal children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27537760/

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine-ketamine (DK) versus dexmedetomidine-midazolam-fentanyl (DMF) combination on the quality of sedation/analgesia and recovery profiles for monitored anesthesia care (MAC).
Fifty six patients undergoing chemoport insertion were randomly assigned to group DK or DMF. All patients received 1 μg.kg(-1) dexmedetomidine over 10 min followed by 0.2-1.0 μg.kg(-1)h(-1) in order to maintain 3 or 4 of modified Observer's Assessment of Analgesia and Sedation score checked every 3 min.

When required, rescue sedatives (0.5 mg.kg-1 of ketamine or 0.05 mg.kg-1 of midazolam) and analgesics (0.5 mg.kg-1 of ketamine or 0.5 μg.kg-1 of fentanyl) were given to the patients in DK or DMF group, respectively. The primary outcome of this study was the recovery parameters (time to spontaneous eye opening and the length of the recovery room stay). The secondary outcomes were parameters indicating quality of sedation/analgesia, cardiorespiratory variables, and satisfaction scores.
There were no significant differences in the onset time, time to spontaneous eye opening, recovery room stay, the incidences of inadequate analgesia, hypotension and bradycardia between the two groups. Despite lower infusion rate of dexmedetomidine, more patients in the DMF group had bispectral index (BIS) < 60 than in the DK group and vice versa for need of rescue sedatives. The satisfaction scores of patients, surgeon, and anesthesiologist in the DMF group were significantly better than the DK group.
The DK and DMF groups showed comparable recovery time, onset time, cardiorespiratory variables, and analgesia. However, the DMF group showed a better sedation quality and satisfaction scores despite the lower infusion rate of dexmedetomidine, and a higher incidence of BIS < 60 than the DK group.

To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the regulation of breathing during sedation with dexmedetomidine, the authors compared ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia during sedation with dexmedetomidine and propofol.
Eleven healthy male volunteers entered this randomized crossover study. Sedation was administered as an intravenous bolus followed by an infusion and monitored by Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, and Bispectral Index Score. Hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses were measured at rest, during sedation (OAA/S 2 to 4), and after recovery. Drug exposure was verified with concentration analysis in plasma.
Ten subjects completed the study. The OAA/S at the sedation goal was 3 (3 to 4) (median [minimum to maximum]) for both drugs. Bispectral Index Score was 82 ± 8 and 75 ± 3, and the drug concentrations in plasma at the sedation target were 0.66 ± 0.14 and 1.26 ± 0.36 μg/ml for dexmedetomidine and propofol, respectively. Compared with baseline, sedation reduced hypoxic ventilation to 59 and 53% and the hypercapnic ventilation to 82 and 86% for dexmedetomidine and propofol, respectively. In addition, some volunteers displayed upper airway obstruction and episodes of apnea during sedation.
Dexmedetomidine-induced sedation reduces ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia to a similar extent as sedation with propofol. This finding implies that sedation with dexmedetomidine interacts with both peripheral and central control of breathing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27483127/

Awareness with recall creates substantial physical and/or psychological distress for the patient, representing a continued threat to patient safety. Factors related to cases of awareness include those of the patient, surgical procedure, anesthesia provider, and system in which providers deliver care. Anesthesia providers today consider use of electroencephalographic depth-of-anesthesia monitors such as the bispectral index monitor (BIS, Covidien, now Medtronic), as a potential tool for preventing awareness.

EC50, BIS, hemodynamics, and side effects were assessed.
The EC50 of propofol was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine groups than in group C, and decreased with increasing dexmedetomidine dose (p < 0.05). BIS values significantly decreased after 2 min of dexmedetomidine infusion in all dexmedetomidine groups; the values at 8 and 10 min were lower in the dexmedetomidine groups than in group C. The heart rate was lower in the dexmedetomidine groups than in group C. The incidence of bradycardia at loss of consciousness increased with increasing dexmedetomidine dose.
Dexmedetomidine significantly and dose-dependently reduced the EC50 of propofol and BIS values during anesthesia induction.

Ninety-three pediatric patients undergoing elective surgery were segregated into three equal groups, namely, Group 1: no CHD, Group 2: acyanotic CHD, and Group 3: cyanotic CHD. General anesthesia was induced with 8% sevoflurane in 6 L/min air-oxygen. The time to induction was noted at loss of eyelash reflex and decrease in bispectral index (BIS) value below 60. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration, minimum alveolar concentration, and BIS were recorded at 15 s intervals for the 1 st min followed by 30 s interval for another 1 min during induction.

The use of the bispectral index (BIS) for monitoring depth of anesthesia during different types of surgery, including epilepsy surgery, is increasing nowadays. The BIS is an EEG-derived variable indicating cortical electrical activity. However, the correlation between the BIS score and the iECoG score, with the purpose of optimizing the quality and time of the iECoG recordings in epilepsy surgery is unknown. The goal of this study was to evaluate the correlation between BIS values and iECoG parameters during the epilepsy surgery under anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl. This is a prospective study that included patients with epilepsy who underwent epilepsy surgery guided by BIS and iECoG (September 2008 to October 2013). Clinical, physiological, and sociodemographic characteristics are shown. We correlated the iECoG parameters (presence of burst suppressions [BS], suppression time [seconds], background frequency [Hz], and type of iECoG score by Mathern et al) with BIS values. We included 28 patients, 15/28 (53.5%) female, general mean age of 30.5 years (range 13-56 years). Patients underwent epilepsy surgery: 22/28 (79%) temporal and 6/28 (21%) extratemporal. We found a nonlinear polynomial cubic relationship between the mentioned variables noting that a BIS range of 40 to 60 gave the following results: iECoG BS periods <5 seconds, background frequency 10 to 17 Hz, and iECoG score 2 characterized by lack of >20-Hz background frequencies. No BS were observed with a BIS > 60. In conclusion BIS values and iECoG parameters during the epilepsy surgery under anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl have a nonlinear correlation. BS patterns were not found with a BIS > 60. These findings show that BIS is a nonlinear multidimensional measure, which possesses high variability with the iECoG parameters. BS patterns are not found with BIS > 60.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27325591/

Its effect can be assessed using the bispectral index (BIS). Many automatic infusion systems are based in pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) models to predict the response of the patient to the drug. However, all these models do not take into account intra and inter-patient variability. An adjusted intraoperative drug administration allows faster recovery and provides post-operative side-effect mitigation
BIS evolution and surgery-recorded propofol infusion data of a group of 60 adult patients (30 males/30 females) with ASA I/II physical status were used to test a real time PK/PD compartmental model. This new algorithm tunes three model parameters (ce50, γ and ke0), minimizing a performance function online.
The error in the BIS signal predicted by the real time PK/PD model was smaller than the error measured with fixed parameter equations. This model shows that ce50, γ and ke0 change with time and patients, given a mean (95% confidence interval) of 3.89 (3.52-4.26)mg/l, 4.63 (4.13-5.13) and 0.36 (0.31-0.4)min(-1), respectively.
The real time PK/PD model proposed provides a closer description of the patient real state at each sample time. This allows for greater control of the drug infusion, and thus the quantity of drug administered can be titrated to achieve the desired effect for the desired duration, and reduce unnecessary waste or post-operative effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27294779/

General anesthesia for a patient with PMD may be difficult mainly because of seizures and airway complications related to poor pharyngeal muscle control. In addition, the possibility of exacerbation of spasticity should be considered. A 20-year-old man with PMD required removal of impacted wisdom teeth under general anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced with thiamylal, fentanyl, and desflurane. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane and continuous intravenous remifentanil under bispectral index and train-of-4 monitoring. Anesthesia lasted 1 hour 20 minutes and was completed uneventfully. Airway complications, seizures, and exacerbation of spasticity did not occur postoperatively. Preoperatively, our patient had no history of epilepsy attacks or aspiration pneumonia, and no clinical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

The objective of this systematic review was to determine whether using a depth of anaesthesia monitoring device improves the safety and efficacy of sedation.
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Electronic databases (CENTRAL; Medline; CINAHL) were searched up to May 2015.
Randomised controlled trials that compared use of a depth of anaesthesia monitoring device to a control group who received standard monitoring during procedural sedation and analgesia were included. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment (Cochrane risk of bias tool) were performed by two reviewers. Safety outcomes were hypoxaemia, hypotension and adverse events. Efficacy outcomes were amount of sedation used, duration of sedation recovery and rate of incomplete procedures.
A total of 16 trials (2138 participants) were included. Evidence ratings were downgraded to either low or moderate quality due to study limitations and imprecision. Meta-analysis of 8 trials (766 participants) found no difference in hypoxaemia (RR 0.87; 95% CI=0.67-1.12). No statistically significant difference in hypotension was observed in meta-analysis of 8 trials (RR 0.96; 95% CI=0.54-1.7; 942 participants). Mean dose of propofol was 51mg lower for participants randomised to depth of anaesthesia monitoring (95% CI=-88.7 to -13.3mg) in meta-analysis of results from four trials conducted with 434 participants who underwent interventional endoscopy procedures with propofol infusions to maintain sedation. The difference in recovery time between depth of anaesthesia and standard monitoring groups was not clinically significant (standardised mean difference -0.41; 95% CI=-0.8 to -0.02; I
Depth of anaesthesia monitoring did impact sedation titration during interventional procedures with propofol infusions. For this reason, it seems reasonable for anaesthetists to utilise a depth of anaesthesia monitoring device for select populations of patients if it is decided that limiting the amount of sedation would be beneficial for the individual patient. However, there is no need to invest in purchasing extra equipment or training staff who are not familiar with this technology (e.g. nurses who do not routinely use a depth of anaesthesia monitoring device during general anaesthesia) because there is no high quality evidence suggestive of clear clinical benefits for patient safety or sedation efficacy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27236824/

Sedation level can be measured with EEG monitoring with the bispectral index (BIS) monitor.
To determine the feasibility and validity of BIS monitoring in terminally ill patients.
In this prospective study, BIS registrations were performed in unconscious end-of-life patients admitted to a palliative care center. Validated scores were used to measure level of sedation (Ramsay score), pain (Numeric Rating Scale or Rotterdam Elderly Pain Observations Scale), delirium (Delirium Observation Screening score), and overall comfort (Numeric Rating Scale). Validity and sensitivity to change of BIS values were considered, and the effects of medication and the time till death on BIS values were evaluated in a linear mixed model analysis.
Fifty-eight patients were included for analysis. BIS monitoring was acceptable to patients, relatives, and medical staff. BIS values were moderately correlated with Ramsay scores (0.46) but were highly variable for deeply sedated patients. BIS values changed significantly before and after a midazolam dose (P < 0.001). Midazolam treatment resulted on average in a statistically significant reduction of the BIS values (-4.5, 95% CI -7.0 to -2.0), whereas morphine and haloperidol did not.
This is one of the first validation studies in which BIS monitoring in end-of-life patients is described. BIS monitoring is feasible in unconscious terminally ill patients. However, based on our results, the wide range of BIS values in deeply sedated and comfortable patients seems to hamper its use in daily clinical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27220943/

This study aimed to assess the effect of intranasally adjunctive dexmedetomidine on perioperative sedative and analgesic requirements in adults.
Patients were randomly divided into four groups to receive preoperative administration of saline, intranasal dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg and 2 μg/kg, and intravenous dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg, respectively. Propofol and remifentanil were target-controlled infused to maintain intraoperative bispectral index at 45-55 and blood pressure at baseline value±20%. Sufentanil was administered to maintain postoperative visual analogue scale ≤3. Perioperative anesthetics requirements were compared using nonparametric tests.
Intranasal dexmedetomidine significantly attenuated propofol requirements for anesthesia induction and maintenance in a dose-dependent manner. Patients given intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg required less remifentanil for anesthesia maintenance. The first postoperative request for sufentanil analgesia was delayed in patients given intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg. The anesthetics-sparing effect of intranasal dexmedetomidine was significantly weaker than intravenous dexmedetomidine at the same dose of 1 μg/kg. The incidences of adverse events, including hemodynamic instability and delayed recovery, were comparable with and without intranasal dexmedetomidine.
Intranasal administration of dexmedetomidine can reduce perioperative anesthetic requirements, and a dose of dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg produces a better effect in adults. The anesthetics-sparing effect of intranasal dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg is less than that with the same intravenous dose of dexmedetomidine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27189297/

This study was carried out in Tanta University Hospital.
Ninety patients of both sexes; American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II; age range from 20 to 60 years; scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia.
Patients were divided into 3 groups (30 each). Group A received 1 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine as intravenous (IV) infusion, group B received labetalol 0.25mg/kg IV, and group C received 10mL saline IV.
The groups were compared for heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and rate pressure product (RPP). Hemodynamic parameters were recorded during the preinduction; after induction; at intubation; and at 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15minutes. The primary outcomes were hemodynamic changes (HR, MBP, and RPP), and the secondary outcome was propofol dose requirement for induction of general anaesthesia.
Significant decrease (P < .05) in HR, MBP, and RPP in groups A and B in comparison with group C and in group A in comparison with group B. Just before intubation, there was a significant decrease (P < .05) in HR, MBP, and RPP in groups A and B in comparison with group C. In group C, there was a significant increase in HR, MBP, and RPP at all points when compared with the baseline. In group A, the mean propofol induction dose (mg) was statistically significantly low as compared with that in groups B and C.
Dexmedetomidine attenuates the hemodynamic stress response to laryngoscopy and intubation more effectively compared with labetalol without any deleterious effects.

Thirty-eight healthy adult male volunteers underwent intravenous sedation with midazolam and propofol (group MP) and with propofol alone (group P) in a randomized crossover manner. In group MP, the participants received midazolam (0.04 mg/kg) and a target-controlled infusion of propofol with a predicted blood concentration of 1.0 μg/mL. In group P, the predicted blood concentration of propofol was maintained at 1.5 μg/mL. The observed variables were bispectral index value, systolic blood pressure, HR, high-frequency component (HF), low-frequency component (LF), and LF/HF ratio. Measurements were conducted over 100-second periods and carried out before, during, and after emergence from sedation by administering 0.2 mg of flumazenil. The paired t test, Wilcoxon t test, repeated-measures analysis of variance, and Friedman χ(2) r test were used for statistical analyses.
The mean age and body weight of the participants were 24.6 ± 2.8 years and 67.0 ± 7.9 kg, respectively. Bispectral index values, systolic blood pressure, and HR showed similar changes in both groups. The LF/HF ratio in group MP during sedation was lower than that before sedation; it also was lower than that in group P during sedation.

This study evaluated the effect of dexamethasone on POCD incidence after noncardiac and nonneurologic surgery.
One hundred and forty patients (ASA I-II; age 60-87 years) took part in a prospective phase III, double blind, randomized study involving the administration or not of 8 mg of IV dexamethasone before general anesthesia under bispectral index (BIS) between 35-45 or 46-55. Neuropsychological tests were applied preoperatively and on the 3rd, 7th, 21st, 90th and 180th days after surgery and compared with normative data. S100β was evaluated before and 12 hours after induction of anesthesia. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) method was applied, followed by the posthoc Bonferroni test considering P<0.05 as significant.
On the 3rd postoperative day, POCD was diagnosed in 25.2% and 15.3% of patients receiving dexamethasone, BIS 35-45, and BIS 46-55 groups, respectively. Meanwhile, POCD was present in 68.2% and 27.2% of patients without dexamethasone, BIS 35-45 and BIS 46-55 groups (p<0.0001). Neuropsychological tests showed that dexamethasone associated to BIS 46-55 decreased the incidence of POCD, especially memory and executive function. The administration of dexamethasone might have prevented the postoperative increase in S100β serum levels.
Dexamethasone can reduce the incidence of POCD in elderly patients undergoing surgery, especially when associated with BIS 46-55. The effect of dexamethasone on S100β might be related with some degree of neuroprotection.

There is clinical evidence for a change in collapsibility of the upper airway depending on the depth of sedation. So far, a dose-response relationship between sedation and collapsibility has not been demonstrated.
DISE and SimS were performed in 60 consecutive patients with SDB under monitoring of depth of sedation by BiSpectral Index® (BIS). Initially, SimS was conducted followed by DISE using bolus application of propofol. Sedation was performed up to a sedation level representing slow wave sleep (BIS = 40). The collapsibility of the upper airway was documented at decreasing sedation levels by an identical pictogram classification.
For all levels and patterns of obstruction, a dose-dependent increase in the collapsibility of the upper airway was detected. A maximum collapsibility was achieved at sedation levels representing slow wave sleep. The collapsibility during SimS corresponded to light sleep stages and did not cover slow wave sleep.
A dose-dependent change of patterns of obstructions can be observed during DISE under BIS monitoring indicating sedation depth. The obtained patterns of obstruction during DISE and SimS should thus be interpreted with regard to the sedation depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27113580/

It is now possible to measure depth of anaesthesia using electroencephalography (EEG). Entropy, an EEG-based monitor can be used to assess the depth of anaesthesia using a strip of electrodes applied to the forehead, and this can guide intraoperative anaesthetic drug administration.
The primary objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of entropy monitoring in facilitating faster recovery from general anaesthesia. We also wanted to assess mortality at 24 hours, 30 days, and one year following general anaesthesia with entropy monitoring.The secondary objectives were to assess the effectiveness of the entropy monitor in: preventing postoperative recall of intraoperative events (awareness) following general anaesthesia; reducing the amount of anaesthetic drugs used; reducing cost of the anaesthetic as well as in reducing time to readiness to leave the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU).
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1990 to September 2014) and EMBASE via Ovid SP (1990 to September 2014). We reran the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE via Ovid SP and EMBASE via Ovid SP in January 2016. We added one potential new study of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting Classification' and we will incorporate this study into the formal review findings during the review update.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in adults and children (aged greater than two years of age), where in one arm entropy monitoring was used for titrating anaesthesia, and in the other standard practice (increase in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, lacrimation, movement in response to noxious surgical stimuli) was used for titrating anaesthetic drug administration. We also included trials with an additional third arm, wherein another EEG monitor, the Bispectral index (BIS) monitor was used to assess anaesthetic depth.
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently extracted details of trial methodology and outcome data from trials considered eligible for inclusion. All analyses were made on an intention-to-treat basis. We used a random-effect model where there was heterogeneity. For assessments of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome that included pooled data from RCTs, we downgraded evidence from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect or potential publication bias).
We included 11 RCTs (962 participants). Eight RCTs (762 participants) were carried out on adults (18 to 80 years of age), two (128 participants) involved children (two to 16 years) and one RCT (72 participants) included patients aged 60 to 75 years. Of the 11 included studies, we judged three to be at low risk of bias, and the remaining eight RCTs at unclear or high risk of bias.Six RCTs (383 participants) estimated the primary outcome, time to awakening after stopping general anaesthesia, which was reduced in the entropy as compared to the standard practice group (mean difference (MD) -5.42 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.77 to -2.08; moderate quality of evidence). We noted heterogeneity for this outcome; on performing subgroup analysis this was found to be due to studies that included participants undergoing major, long duration surgeries (off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, major urological surgery). The MD for time to awakening with four studies on ambulatory procedures was -3.20 minutes (95% CI -3.94 to -2.45). No trial reported the second primary outcome, mortality at 24 hours, 30 days, and one year with the use of entropy monitoring.Eight trials (797 participants) compared the secondary outcome, postoperative recall of intraoperative events (awareness) in the entropy and standard practice groups. Awareness was reported by only one patient in the standard practice group, making meaningful estimation of benefit of entropy monitoring difficult; moderate quality of evidence.All 11 RCTs compared the amount of anaesthetic agent used between the entropy and standard practice groups. Six RCTs compared the amount of propofol, four compared the amount of sevoflurane and one the amount of isoflurane used between the groups. Analysis of three studies (166 participants) revealed that the MD of propofol consumption between the entropy group and control group was -11.56 mcg/kg/min (95% CI -24.05 to 0.92); low quality of evidence. Analysis of another two studies (156 participants) showed that the MD in sevoflurane consumption in the entropy group compared to the control group was -3.42 mL (95% CI -6.49 to -0.35); moderate quality of evidence.No trial reported on the secondary outcome of the cost of general anaesthesia.Three trials (170 participants) estimated MD in time to readiness to leave the PACU of the entropy group as compared to the control group (MD -5.94 minutes, 95% CI -16.08 to 4.20; low quality of evidence). Heterogeneity was noted, which was due to the difference in anaesthetic technique (propofol-based general anaesthesia) in one study. The remaining two studies had used volatile-based general anaesthesia. The MD in time to readiness to leave the PACU was -4.17 minutes (95% CI -6.84 to -1.51) with these two studies.
The evidence as regards time to awakening, recall of intraoperative awareness and reduction in inhalational anaesthetic agent use was of moderate quality. The quality of evidence of as regards reduction in intravenous anaesthetic agent (propofol) use, as well as time to readiness to leave the PACU was found to be of low quality. As the data are limited, further studies consisting of more participants will be required for ascertaining benefits of entropy monitoring.Further studies are needed to assess the effect of entropy monitoring on focal issues such as short-term and long-term mortality, as well as cost of general anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26976247/

However, no study has been conducted using a closed-loop system specifically designed for sedation in patients under spinal anesthesia. We developed an automatic anesthesia sedation system that allows for closed-loop delivery of propofol for sedation integrating a decision support system, called the hybrid sedation system (HSS). The objective of this study is to compare this system with standard practice. One hundred fifty patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups: HSS-Group (N = 75), in which propofol was administered using a closed-loop system; Control Group (N = 75), in which propofol was delivered manually. The clinical performance of the propofol sedation control is defined as efficacy to maintain bispectral index (BIS) near 65. The clinical control was called 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Poor' and 'Inadequate' with BIS values within 10 %, from 11 to 20 %, 21 to 30 %, or greater than 30 % of the BIS target of 65, respectively. The controller performance was evaluated using Varvel's parameters. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation, groups were compared using t test or Chi square test, P < 0.05.

We hypothesized that, compared with dexmedetomidine, midazolam might have a subtle influence on sleep quality after surgery following elective transurethral prostatic resection (TURP) in elderly male patients.
A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted at the First Hospital of China Medical University from July 2014 to January 2015. One hundred eleven patients undergoing TURP were enrolled and received intravenous saline infusion (control group), dexmedetomidine (dexmedetomidine group), or midazolam (midazolam group) for sedation during the spinal anesthesia procedure. The intraoperative sedative state and postoperative sleep quality were evaluated using a Bispectral Index (BIS)-Vista monitor. The primary outcome was postoperative sleep quality, as measured by the BIS-Vista monitor on the first night after surgery.
The intraoperative BIS area under the curve value was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group (54.1%) compared with those in the other 2 groups (control group, 94.1%; midazolam group, 77.2%).The postoperative BIS area under the curve value was highest in the dexmedetomidine group at 88.7%. The BIS sleep efficiency index showed a significant 33.1% increase in the midazolam group compared with the dexmedetomidine group. The duration of sleep in the midazolam group was 237.8 minutes longer than that in the dexmedetomidine group.

However, local anesthesia during the whole procedure may be impossible in some patients due to uncontrolled anxiety, fear, delirium or exhaustion. Therefore, sedative drugs have been used for DBS, but findings of MER during the procedures have not been reported in detail, especially in the globus pallidus internus (GPi). We introduce our experience using 'asleep-awake' technique by dexmedetomidine (DEX) anesthesia with MER findings during DBS in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients.
Data from 14 different subcortical nuclei from 8 consecutive IPD patients whom had DBS at the GPi (6 patients) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) (2 patients) were retrospectively reviewed. We used continuous DEX and intermittent small boluses of propofol during the painful procedure ('asleep phase'), accompanied with continuous intraoperative monitorings of bispectral index (BIS) and modified observer's assessment of sedation (MOAA/S). Then sedatives were discontinued during MER recording ('awake phase'). Characteristic findings and firing rates of neurons were analyzed and compared to those from other 6 patients who underwent surgery under local anesthesia.
All patients were satisfactorily sedated using this technique without any respiratory or hemodynamic complications. Characteristics of spike activities of each nucleus were inspected and analyzed quantitatively. We could inspect changes of spike activities according to level of patients' consciousness in some cases, but the localizing value was good to decide the target in all cases. Firing rates of group whom sedatives were given during asleep phase ('sedatives') were significantly lower than those of group under local anesthesia ('no sedative'). Intraoperative length of target nuclei, postoperative imaging and postoperative changes of UPDRS III score indicated satisfactory outcome.
We concluded that though MER findings may change during DEX-based monitored 'sleep-awake' anesthesia, it did not affect the results of target localization for the clinical purpose. However, it should be considered that use of sedatives before MER could result in changes of firing rate and pattern depending on the patient's state of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26895206/
26859877,Amnesia of the Operating Room in the B-Unaware and BAG-RECALL Clinical Trials.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2016,"Chen Y, Cai A, Dexter F, Pryor KO, Jacobsohn EM, Glick DB, Willingham MD, Escallier K, Winter A, Avidan MS","Patient memories of the operating room (OR) may serve as the informational basis for assessing satisfaction with individual anesthesiologists. Furthermore, the provision of clinically important information may assume that perioperative memories are retained. Studies assessing the extent of perioperative amnesia and factors associated with perioperative amnesia are sparse. Therefore, we assessed patient amnesia of the OR and of the preoperative holding area in hospitals where midazolam is typically administered in the preoperative holding area and evaluated whether midazolam dose administered in the preoperative holding area and patient age were associated with amnesia of the OR before induction of anesthesia.
This was a retrospective study among 7750 adult patients who had general anesthesia and participated in the B-Unaware and Bispectral Index or Anesthetic Gas to Reduce Explicit Recall (BAG-RECALL) clinical trials. The last location the patient remembered before induction of anesthesia and the first location they remembered after induction of anesthesia were determined through a modified Brice questionnaire administered over the phone 30 days postoperatively. Regarding the preoperative period, patients were excluded if their last memory was unclear with respect to location before induction of anesthesia or if they were recruited at Winnipeg, where midazolam was typically first administered in the OR. Midazolam dose (mg/kg) administered in the preoperative holding area was divided into quartiles. Poisson regression models were used to calculate age- and multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for the association between midazolam dose and amnesia of the OR before induction of anesthesia.
Of the 5339 patients included, 59.5% (95% CI, 58.2–60.9) of patients had amnesia of the OR before induction of anesthesia. In addition, 44.1% (95% CI, 42.8–45.7) last remembered the preoperative holding area, and 15.4% (95% CI, 14.4–16.4) only had preoperative memories before the holding area. The percentages of patients with amnesia of the OR before induction of anesthesia differed according to age groups: 50.7% (95% CI, 47.7%–53.7%) in patients aged 18 to 47 years versus 70.0% (95% CI, 67.0%–72.9%) in patients aged 73 to 99 years. Patients in the highest midazolam quartile had an adjusted prevalence ratio of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.22–1.42) for amnesia of the OR compared with those who did not receive midazolam.
In hospitals where patients typically receive midazolam in the preoperative holding area, the majority of patients do not remember the OR, and a clinically relevant number of patients does not remember the preoperative holding area. If additional studies produce results indicating that a substantial proportion of patients has amnesia of the anesthesiologist, these findings would argue against the validity of assessing patient satisfaction with individual anesthesiologists providing exclusively OR care in such hospitals. Furthermore, if additional studies yield findings suggesting patient amnesia of the preoperative holding area, these results would suggest reconsideration of providing clinically important information only in the preoperative holding area. Older age and midazolam-induced anterograde amnesia are probably associated with impaired perioperative memories.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26859877/

However, whether anesthetic agents affect the accuracy of the technique remains unclear. We examined the effects of anesthetic agents on pupillary reactivity. Thirty-five patients scheduled for breast or thyroid surgery were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into four groups based on the technique used to maintain anesthesia: a sevoflurane-remifentanil (SEV/REM) group, a sevoflurane (SEV) group, a desflurane-remifentanil (DES/REM) group, and a propofol-remifentanil (PRO/REM) group. We measured maximum resting pupil size (MAX), reduction pupil size ratio (%CH), latency duration (LAT) and neurological pupil index (NPi). A marked reduction in MAX and %CH compared with baseline was observed in all groups, but LAT was unchanged during surgery. NPi reduced within the first hour of surgery in the SEV/REM, SEV, and DES/REM groups, but was not significantly different in the PRO/REM group. Compared with the PRO/REM group, mean %CH and NPi in patients anesthetized with SEV/REM, SEV or DES/REM were markedly lower at 1 h after surgery had commenced. There was no correlation between NPi and bispectral index. Fentanyl given alone decreased pupil size and %CH in light reflex, but did not change the NPi. NPi was decreased by inhalational anesthesia not but intravenous anesthesia. The difference in pupil reactivity between inhalational anesthetic and propofol may indicate differences in the alteration of midbrain reflexs in patients under inhalational or intravenous anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26858211/

The study compared compare patients' pain, satisfaction, adverse events, and sedation depth during extraction of third molars using a sedative protocol of intravenous (IV; 1.0 μg/kg) versus intranasal (IN; 1.5 μg/kg) administration of dexmedetomidine. In total, 240 patients were randomized, 160 patients received dexmedetomidine, and data, including the amount of agent used, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, adverse events, VAS score of patient satisfaction, and bispectral index, were recorded.
Patients in the dexmedetomidine groups reported lower VAS pain scores and higher VAS satisfaction scores than patients in the local anesthesia group. There were no statistically meaningful differences between dexmedetomidine groups. Sedation with the IV route was slightly deeper than with the IN route. However, there were no statistically meaningful differences.
IN or IV administration of dexmedetomidine is recommended as an effective, safe, and competent protocol in outpatient sedative surgeries.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26850877/
26771265,A Randomized Controlled Trial to Determine the Effect of Depth of Anesthesia on Emergence Agitation in Children.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2016,"Frederick HJ, Wofford K, de Lisle Dear G, Schulman SR","The cause of emergence agitation (EA) in children is unknown. Rapid emergence from inhaled anesthesia has been implicated because EA is more common with sevoflurane than with halothane. A dose-dependent effect of sevoflurane, which increases seizure-like electroencephalogram activity, has also been proposed.
To determine whether depth of anesthesia as measured by bispectral index (BIS) affects EA, 40 ASA physical status I to II children aged 2 to 8 years undergoing ophthalmic surgery were enrolled in a blinded randomized controlled trial of low-normal (40-45, deep) versus high-normal (55-60, light) anesthesia. To distinguish transient irritability from severe EA, the primary outcome was first-stage postanesthesia care unit (PACU I) peak Pediatric Assessment of Emergence Delirium (PAED) score, with secondary outcomes of PAED and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scores at emergence, postoperative fentanyl dose, emergence time, and discharge time. Subjects received a standard anesthesia protocol with oral midazolam followed by mask induction with sevoflurane 8%, fentanyl 1 to 1.5 μg/kg IV (then as needed), neuromuscular blockade, and endotracheal intubation. Providers titrated expired sevoflurane (in N2O 67%) from 0.5% to 3% to maintain BIS range. PAED, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scores were measured at emergence, at PACU I arrival, and during PACU I stay.
There was little difference between the groups in the primary outcome, peak PACU I PAED score (light: 7.7 ± 4.6; deep: 8.6 ± 5.3; mean difference, 0.9; 95% confidence interval, 4.1 to -2.3; effect size, 0.18). Discharge times were similar between groups. Treatment for severe EA was rare.
There was no significant effect of BIS-guided deep versus light anesthesia on severe EA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26771265/
29444393,Two different techniques of facial mask induction of anesthesia in children provide identical intubation conditions despite different anesthetic depth.,Acta anaesthesiologica Belgica,2016,"Hallet C, Venneman I, Hans G, Bonhomme V","Sevoflurane induction in chil- dren is performed using different techniques. Constricted, centered, and symmetrical pupils (CCSP) are classically the endpoint to be achieved before laryngoscopy is performed.
We investigated whether two different inhalation induction techniques with the same clinical end- point provided similar intubating conditions and comparable depth of anesthesia as assessed by the Bispectral Index (BIS).
Following IRB approval, and informed parental consent, 20 children were recruited. They were sched- uled for general anesthesia with tracheal intubation, and randomly assigned to Group 1, where the practitioner used 6% inspired sevoflurane in 50% 0₂/N₂0, and no manually assisted ventilation, or Group 2, where inspired sevoflurane was 8% in 50% 0₂/N₂0, and ventilation was manually supported upon loss of consciousness. BIS values were blinded. Laryngoscopy was performed after CCSP. Intubation conditions scoring was based on jaw relaxation (mobile = 1, partially mobile = 2, fixed = 3), position of vocal cords (open = 1, half-closed = 2, closed = 3), and cough (no cough = 1, 1 or 2 coughing efforts = 2, persistent coughing = 3). A total score > 3 corresponded to non-optimal conditions.
Upon CCSP, BIS values were significantly lower in Group 1 [mean (SD) : 30 (8) - 48 (18), p <0.001], despite significantly higher end-tidal sevoflurane concentration in Group 2 [mean (SD) : 5.0 (0.7) - 6.2 (0.5) ; p <0.001]. Time to CCSP was slightly shorter in Group 2. Intubation conditions were always optimal except for one patient of Group 1.
Both induction techniques achieve good intubating conditions. Possible explanations for the between-group BIS difference include variable appreciation of the CCSP endpoint, different induction lengths or sevoflurane equilibration times, or sevoflurane-induced increase in electroencephalogram power. A better indicator of the best time to intubate is needed to avoid too deep anesthesia in children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29444393/

For intravenous anesthetics however, no decisive evidence in favor of breath concentration monitoring has been presented up until now. At the same time, questions remain with respect to the performance of currently used plasma pharmacokinetic models implemented in target-controlled infusion systems. In this study, we investigate whether breath monitoring of propofol could improve the predictive performance of currently applied, target-controlled infusion models.
Based on data from a healthy volunteer study, we developed an addition to the current state-of-the-art pharmacokinetic model for propofol, to accommodate breath concentration measurements. The potential of using this pharmacokinetic (PK) model in a Bayesian forecasting setting was studied using a simulation study. Finally, by introducing bispectral index monitor (BIS) measurements and the accompanying BIS models into our PK model, we investigated the relationship between BIS and predicted breath concentrations.
We show that the current state-of-the-art pharmacokinetic model is easily extended to reliably describe propofol kinetics in exhaled breath. Furthermore, we show that the predictive performance of the a priori model is improved by Bayesian adaptation based on the measured breath concentrations, thereby allowing further treatment individualization and a more stringent control on the targeted plasma concentrations during general anesthesia. Finally, we demonstrated concordance between currently advocated BIS models, relying on predicted effect-site concentrations, and our new approach in which BIS measurements are derived from predicted breath concentrations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26715214/

The pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and drug interactions of the combination are well understood, but the use of a combined PK and PD model to control target-controlled infusion pumps has not been investigated. In this study, we prospectively tested the accuracy of a PD target-controlled infusion algorithm for propofol and remifentanil using a response surface model of their combined effects on Bispectral Index (BIS).
Effect-site, target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil were given using an algorithm based on standard PK models linked to a PD response surface model of their combined effects on BIS. The combination of a targeted BIS value and adjustable ratio of propofol to remifentanil was used to adjust infusion rates. The standard model performance measures of median performance error (bias) and median absolute performance error (inaccuracy), expressed as percentages, were used to assess accuracy of the infusions in a convenience sample of 50 adult patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. The influence of age and weight on the performance of the model was also assessed.
Patients had a mean (range) age of 48 (19-73) years, weight of 80 (45-169) kg, and body mass index of 28 (19-45) kg/m. The overall model had a bias of 8% (SD 24%) and inaccuracy of 25% (SD 13%). Performance was least accurate during the early induction phase of anesthesia. There was no significant bias in BIS predictions with increasing age (P = 0.44) or weight (P = 0.56).
The algorithm performed adequately in a clinical setting. The algorithm could be further refined, and assessment of its accuracy and utility in comparison to current clinical practice for giving IV anesthesia is warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26683103/

This study analyzed the relationship between BIS values and AEP indices from different sites on the head to establish alternative sensor locations for AEP recording. Thirty patients scheduled for elective surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia were randomly assigned to the forehead, nose or mandible groups (n = 10 patients per group). AEP sensors were placed at the assigned position for each group and BIS sensors were placed on the forehead. BIS value and AEP index were simultaneously recorded from induction until emergence from general anesthesia. Relationships between BIS values and AEP indices were analyzed using a regression method and compared between groups using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Square regression models better expressed the relationships than linear models in all groups. The z-transformed coefficient in the forehead group was the same as the nose group (p = 0.24) and significantly different in the mandible group (p = 0.0046). These findings suggest that AEPs can be accurately recorded from sensors placed on the nose.

This study was designed to evaluate the effects of remifentanil and dexmedetomidine on maternal hemodynamics and bispectral index, and neonatal outcomes in elective caesarean delivery. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-four women undergoing elective cesarean delivery with ASA I or II and term or near-term singleton pregnancies were randomly assigned to receive remifentanil at a loading dose of 2 μg/kg over 10 min followed by a continuous infusion of 2 μg/kg/h until about 6 min before fetal delivery (Group REM), or dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 0.4 μg/kg over 10 min followed by a continuous infusion of 0.4 μg/kg/h until about 6 min before fetal delivery (Group DEX). Maternal hemodynamics and BIS values were recorded. Neonatal effects were assessed using Apgar scores and umbilical cord blood gas analysis. RESULTS Mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased after intubation in both groups, and the change magnitude of the MAP was higher in Group DEX (P<0.05). Patients in Group DEX had a lower BIS value at recovery and consumed less propofol during surgery (P<0.05). The incidences of neonatal resuscitation at 1 min were 81.8% in Group REM and 54.5% in Group DEX (P=0.052). There was no significant difference in either group in Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min and umbilical cord blood gas values. CONCLUSIONS Both remifentanil and dexmedetomidine are effective to blunt hemodynamic responses to intubation and also seem safe for neonates at the administrated doses, but remifentanil still has the potential to cause neonatal transient respiratory depression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26638888/
26632125,Effects of dexmedetomidine for retrobulbar anesthesia in orbital ball implants after enucleation surgery.,Indian journal of ophthalmology,2015,"Ye W, Hu Z, Jin X, Wang P","Dexmedetomidine (DEX) can prolong the duration of local anesthetics, but the use of retrobulbar DEX has not been fully elucidated. This study was designed to determine the effects of adding DEX to lidocaine-bupivacaine for retrobulbar block in orbital ball implants after enucleation surgery.
A total of 200 patients of both sexes aged 30-60 years of American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II, scheduled for orbital ball implants after enucleation surgery, were enrolled for the study. Patients were randomly assigned into one of the two groups: Control (n = 100) received lidocaine-bupivacaine retrobulbar block, DEX (n = 100) received lidocaine-bupivacaine plus 1 ug/kg DEX retrobulbar block. Hemodynamic data, duration of motor and sensory blocks, pain by visual analog scale, bispectral index (BIS), side effects, consumption of dezocine as a rescue analgesic, patient and surgeon satisfaction were recorded.
Duration of analgesia was prolonged in the DEX, compared with the control group ([258.35 ± 66.82 min] as [130.75 ± 29.52 min], [P < 0.05]). The median number of postoperative analgesic requests per patient during the first 24 h was decreased in the DEX group (P < 0.05). In the first 24 postoperative hours, DEX group consumed significantly less dezocine (P < 0.05). BIS values and mean arterial pressure remained lower in the DEX group, but within the safe range (P < 0.05). The side effect profile was similar between the two groups. Patients and surgeon satisfaction were higher in the DEX group (P < 0.05). Demographic characteristics were comparable in both groups (P > 0.05).

26621628,Can Intraoperative Processed EEG Predict Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction in the Elderly?,Clinical therapeutics,2015,"Deiner S, Luo X, Silverstein JH, Sano M","Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious and costly complication of the elderly; even mild impairment has the potential to impact overall well being. Anesthesiologists continue to search for ways to manipulate intraoperative technique to optimize postoperative cognition in the elderly. Depth of anesthesia during surgery is an area that has shown some promise for short-term outcomes, such as delirium. However, excessive depth has both positive and negative associations with longer-term POCD. We hypothesize that this uncertainty is due to the inability of median depth to capture the amount of burst suppression or electrical silence. In this study, our purpose was to identify the intraoperative processed EEG parameters that are most closely correlated with POCD.
To explore the association of several processed EEG parameters with POCD, we performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 105 patients aged >68 years scheduled for major surgery under general anesthesia. Intraoperative medications, hemodynamics, processed EEG and cerebral oxygen saturation were recorded. All patients had a cognitive battery before surgery and repeated at 3 months afterward.
One hundred and five patients enrolled and 77 (73.3%) patients completed the 3-month cognitive testing. The incidence of POCD was 27%; the median Bispectral Index value for patients who developed POCD was similar to patients who did not (46 vs 42 minutes). However, patients who developed POCD spent less time with Bispectral Index <45 minutes (82.8 vs 122.5 minutes, P = 0.01) and burst suppression (35 vs 96 minutes, P = 0.04). Hypotension, cerebral desaturation, and use of total intravenous anesthesia were similar between patients with and without POCD.
Patients who developed POCD spent less time in EEG burst suppression and less time in deep states. Burst suppression may be protective for POCD. Further work is needed to definitively identify the role of burst suppression in the context of other patient and intraoperative variables to prevent POCD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26621628/

we retrospectively analyzed comatose patients admitted to our neurological intensive care unit (NICU) from 2011 to 2014 with a diagnosis of definitive NCSE that underwent b-BIS monitoring for at least 24h to guide anesthetic sedation. Clinical, electroencephalography and neuroimaging findings were analyzed. Moreover, all parameters from the b-BIS data including the CDSA were reviewed during periods of NCSE (NCSE pattern) and profound sedation (sedation pattern).
15 NCSE patients were included. The delay from the diagnosis of NCSE to the onset of b-BIS monitoring was 8 (0.5-31)h and total time of b-BIS monitoring 7.8±6.5 days. CDSA during NCSE pattern was characterized by continuous or intermittent red and dark red tones, spectral edge frequency (SEF) in the delta-theta range, with or without asymmetry and BIS number trend with significant variability. In contrast, CDSA during sedation revealed predominance of orange, yellow, green and occasionally blue tones, SEF in the alpha-beta range, absence of asymmetry and stability of BIS number.

Polysomnography (PSG) is considered the gold standard test to monitor sleep objectively, but some practical and technical constraints exist due to environmental and patient considerations. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is commonly used in clinical practice for guiding anesthetic administration and provides an index based on relationships between EEG components. Due to similarities in EEG synchronization between anesthesia and sleep, several studies have assessed BIS as a sleep monitor with contradictory results. The aim of this study was to evaluate objectively both the feasibility and reliability of BIS for sleep monitoring through a robust methodology, which included full PSG recordings at a baseline situation and after 40 h of sleep deprivation. Results confirmed that the BIS index was highly correlated with the hypnogram (0.89 ± 0.02), showing a progressive decrease as sleep deepened, and an increase during REM sleep (awake: 91.77 ± 8.42; stage N1: 83.95 ± 11.05; stage N2: 71.71 ± 11.99; stage N3: 42.41 ± 9.14; REM: 80.11 ± 8.73). Mean and median BIS values were lower in the post-deprivation night than in the baseline night, showing statistical differences for the slow wave sleep (baseline: 42.41 ± 9.14 vs. post-deprivation: 39.49 ± 10.27; p = 0.02). BIS scores were able to discriminate properly between deep (N3) and light (N1, N2) sleep. BIS values during REM overlapped those of other sleep stages, although EMG activity provided by the BIS monitor could help to identify REM sleep if needed. In conclusion, BIS monitors could provide a useful measure of sleep depth in especially particular situations such as intensive care units, and they could be used as an alternative for sleep monitoring in order to reduce PSG-derived costs and to increase capacity in ambulatory care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26578097/

Forty-eight participants were enrolled at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from October 2011 to March 2012 and randomly assigned to a mild or a deep sedation group using computer- generated random numbers. Preliminary tests were performed a week prior to scanning to determine target effect site concentrations based on BIS and concomitant Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scores while under propofol. Within one week of the preliminary tests where propofol dose-response was established, BOLD-fMRI was conducted to examine brain activation with the subject awake, and with propofol infusion at the sedation level.
Mild propofol sedation inhibited left inferior parietal lobe activation. Deep sedation inhibited activation of the left insula, left superior temporal gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus. Compared with mild sedation, deep propofol sedation inhibited activation of the left thalamus, precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate, and right basal nuclei.
Mild and deep propofol sedation are associated with inhibition of different brain regions, possibly explaining differences in the respective loss of consciousness processes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26564411/

The present study was designed to investigate the effects of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on postoperative analgesia and recovery after abdominal colectomy surgeries.Sixty-seven patients scheduled for abdominal colectomy under general anesthesia were divided into two groups, which were maintained using propofol/remifentanil/dexmedetomidine (PRD) or propofol/remifentanil/saline (PRS).During surgery, patients in the PRD group had a lower bispectral index value, which indicated a deeper anesthetic state and a higher sedation score right after extubation, than patients in the PRS group. During the first 24 hours after surgery, PRD patients consumed less morphine in patient-controlled analgesia, and had a lower score in visual analog scale, than their controls from the PRS group. The global 40-item quality of recovery questionnaire and 9-question fatigue severity score both showed a higher recovery score from day 3 after surgery in the PRD group.Intraoperative administration of dexmedetomidine seems to promote the analgesic property of morphine-based patient-controlled analgesia, and speed recovery from surgery in patients after abdominal colectomy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26512563/

Recently, the neurophysiologically based EEG measures of cortical input (CI) and cortical state (CS) have been shown to be prospective indicators of analgesia/antinociception and hypnosis, respectively. In this study, we compared CI and an alternate measure of CS, the composite cortical state (CCS), with the Bispectral Index (BIS) and another recently developed measure of antinociception, the composite variability index (CVI). CVI is an EEG-derived measure based on a weighted combination of BIS and estimated electromyographic activity. By assessing the relationship between these indices for equivalent levels of hypnosis (as quantified using the BIS) and the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance (as determined by the predicted effect-site concentration of remifentanil), we sought to evaluate whether combining hypnotic and analgesic measures could better predict movement in response to a noxious stimulus than when used alone.
Time series of BIS and CVI indices and the raw EEG from a previously published study were reanalyzed. In our current study, the data from 80 patients, each randomly allocated to a target hypnotic level (BIS 50 or BIS 70) and a target remifentanil level (Remi-0, -2, -4 or -6 ng/mL), were included in the analysis. CCS, CI, BIS, and CVI were calculated or quantified at baseline and at a number of intervals after the application of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale and a subsequent tetanic stimulus. The dependency of the putative measures of antinociception CI and CVI on effect-site concentration of remifentanil was then quantified, together with their relationship to the hypnotic measures CCS and BIS. Finally, statistical clustering methods were used to evaluate the extent to which simple combinations of antinociceptive and hypnotic measures could better detect and predict response to stimulation.
Before stimulation, both CI and CVI differentiated patients who received remifentanil from those who were randomly allocated to the Remi-0 group (CI: Cohen's d = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.83; CVI: Cohen's d = 0.72, 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.88). Strong correlations between BIS and CCS were found (at different periods: 0.55 < R2 < 0.68, P < 0.001). Application of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation stimulus was associated with changes in CI and CCS, whereas, subsequent to the application of both stimuli, changes in all measures were seen. Pairwise combinations of CI and CCS showed higher sensitivity in detecting response to stimulation than CVI and BIS combined (sensitivity [99% confidence interval], 75.8% [52.7%-98.8%] vs 42% [15.4%-68.5%], P = 0.006), with specificity for CI and CCS approaching significance (52% [34.7%-69.3%] vs 24% [9.1%-38.9%], P = 0.0159).

The Wavelet-based Anesthetic Value for Central Nervous System (WAVCNS) index calculated by this monitor is based on wavelet analysis of a normalized electroencephalogram signal in the γ-frequency band. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of disagreement between the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the WAVCNS index during propofol-based and sevoflurane-based maintenance of general anesthesia in a routine surgical population.
Patients undergoing elective surgery were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive either propofol or sevoflurane for the maintenance of anesthesia and remifentanil in both groups. Anesthesiologists were blinded to monitors in both groups. Discordance between the 2 monitors was assessed by the count of discrepancy in recommendation (DR) (type 1 defined as one parameter <40 and the other >60, or type 2 defined as BIS and WAVCNS values on different sides of a threshold [40 or 60]) and also by the proportion of agreement (P0) between WAVCNS and BIS, obtained every 5 seconds, in 3 categories of index (<40, 40-60, and >60).
The analyzed data set consisted of 22 patients (36,872 data pairs) in the propofol group and 24 patients (32,826 data pairs) in the sevoflurane group. The type 1 DR rarely occurred in both the groups (<1%); however, the median (interquartile range) type 2 DR was significantly more frequent in the propofol group (20.6% [7.0-36.9] vs 4.5% [2.3-12.4]; P = 0.0005). The median difference in P0 was 11.53% (95% confidence interval, 0.57-21.32). Major disagreement between WAVCNS index and BIS was related to the weight of burst suppression pattern for the index calculation.
Disagreement between BIS and NeuroSENSE during the maintenance of general anesthesia was worse in the propofol group than that in the sevoflurane groups. The disagreement increases during deep anesthesia or in the occurrence of burst suppression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26489054/

In this study, we evaluated the effect of adjuvant dexmedetomidine on smooth emergence from anaesthesia after orthopaedic surgery in elderly patients.
A total 115 patients (ASA I-II, aged over 65 years) were randomly allocated into four groups. Anaesthesia was maintained with either sevoflurane or total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) comprising propofol and remifentanil. Patients were also administered either dexmedetomidine (0.4 μg kg(-1) hr(-1); SD and TD) intraoperatively or normal saline (SN or TN) as a control. The bispectral index (BIS) score was maintained from 40-60 intraoperatively. All anaesthetics and dexmedetomidine were discontinued at surgical conclusion, and the recovery times (durations to a BIS = 60, 70, and 80; eye opening; and extubation) were measured. The mean arterial pressure, heart rate, Ricker's agitation-sedation scale (RSAS), visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, and incidences of emergence agitation and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were measured in the recovery room.
Dexmedetomidine significantly decreased the RSAS score in the SD and TD groups, and a calm state postoperatively occurred more frequently in these groups than in the control groups. The heart rate and incidence of emergence agitation were lower in the dexmedetomidine groups. Recovery time was higher in the SD group than in the SN group, and no significant differences occurred between the TN and TD groups. The VAS score was lower in the SD group than in the SN group, and the PONV did not differ regardless of the use of dexmedetomidine.
Dexmedetomidine may be an effective intraoperative adjuvant for a reducing emergence agitation and smooth emergence from anaesthesia after orthopaedic surgery in elderly patients.

This prospective and randomized study was completed in the Department of Anesthesiology, Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey between February 2013 and December 2014. Sixty patients undergoing elective hip surgery under spinal anesthesia in the geriatric age group with albumin levels below 3 g/dl were randomly divided into Group I and Group II. After administration of spinal block, Group I were given 0.05 mg/kg bolus midazolam, and then 0.02-0.1 mg/kg/hr dose infusion was begun. In Group II, 1 mg/kg bolus propofol was given within 10 minutes, and then 1-3 mg/kg/hr infusion was begun. The systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation values, respiratory rate, and Wilson's 5-stage sedation score were recorded at 15-minute intervals. At the end of the operation, the recovery time and surgeon satisfaction were recorded.
The recovery times for patients in Group I were found to be longer than in Group II (p less than 0.05). The respiration rate in patients in Group I at the start of surgery, 15th minute of surgery, and after surgery were lower than in Group II (p less than 0.05).

The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of dexmedetomidine between elderly and young patients during spinal anesthesia.
34 subjects (elderly group: n = 15; young group: n = 19) with spinal anesthesia were enrolled in the present study following the inclusion/exclusion criteria detailed below. All subjects received intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine with a loading dose of 0.5 µg x kg⁻¹ for 10 minutes and a maintenance dose of 0.5 µg x kg⁻¹ x h⁻¹ for 50 minutes. Plasma concentrations of dexmedetomidine were detected by the HPLC-MS/MS method and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using WinNolin software.
There was no significant difference between the elderly and young subjects in major pharmacokinetic parameters. There was a marked gender difference in the Cmax (peak plasma concentration) and tmax (time to reach Cmax) between genders in elderly subjects, though in this cohort the other pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different. In the young subjects there were no noteworthy variations between genders in pharmacokinetic parameters. There was no significant difference between the two groups in BISAUC(0-t) (the area under the bispectral index-time curve from time 0 to t hours), BISmin (the minimum value of the bispectral index after drug delivery), and or tmin-BIS (bispectral index for the minimum value of time). SBP (systolic blood pressure), DBP (diastolic blood pressure), HR (heart rate), and SpO₂(pulse oxygen saturation) developed substantive differences in a time-dependent manner, but there were no statistically significant differences in these four indicators in the time*group at three time points (1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours after drug administration); while SBP was significantly different between the groups, this differential declined in a time-dependent manner, and there were no significant attendant differences in the D-value. The observed values and D-values of DBP and HR were similar in the groups, but the observed value and D-value of SpO₂did differ. There were 14 drug-related adverse events in the young group, and 26 drug-related adverse events in the elderly group, a 46% differential. The percentage of patients who requiring intervention during surgery was 68.75% (11/16) in the elderly group and 36.84% (7/19) in the young group, with no significant difference between the two groups once age was factored in (p = 0.06). None of the pharmacodynamic indices, however, correlated with the key pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC(0→t), AUC(0→∞)) of dexmedetomidine.
The clearance of dexmedetomidine in elderly patients showed a declining trend compared to young patients. Interventions in the elderly group were more frequent than in the young group, and the elderly group showed significant adverse effects. It is suggested that elderly patients who use dexmedetomidine may benefit from a different dose. However, further research with a larger population size is required to confirm these findings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26413731/

Using PubMed as the principal source, this review included published studies in all languages comparing mortality in patients with low- and high-processed electro-encephalo-graphic index values.
All published studies used the bispectral index (BIS) monitor to measure anesthetic depth. The majority of the published observational studies were post hoc analyses of studies undertaken for other purposes. Most of these studies report a statistically significant association between deep general anesthesia (i.e., BIS values < 45) and death. Some studies also suggest an association between deep general anesthesia and myocardial infarction or postoperative cognitive decline. The combination of low BIS values and low delivered anesthetic concentrations (thus defining increased anesthetic sensitivity) may identify patients at particularly high risk. One of the three available randomized controlled trials reports worse outcomes in the BIS = 50 group compared with the BIS > 80 group, and two report no difference in mortality between the BIS = 35 and BIS = 50-55 groups.

Different synchronization measures have their own properties to reflect the changes of EEG activities during different anesthetic states. However, the performance characteristics and the relations of different synchronization measures in evaluating synchronization changes during propofol-induced anesthesia are not fully elucidated. Two-channel EEG data from seven volunteers who had undergone a brief standardized propofol anesthesia were then adopted to calculate eight synchronization indexes. We computed the prediction probability (P K ) of synchronization indexes with Bispectral Index (BIS) and propofol effect-site concentration (C eff ) to quantify the ability of the indexes to predict BIS and C eff . Also, box plots and coefficient of variation were used to reflect the different synchronization changes and their robustness to noise in awake, unconscious and recovery states, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was used for assessing the relationship among synchronization measures, BIS and C eff . Permutation cross mutual information (PCMI) and determinism (DET) could predict BIS and follow C eff better than nonlinear interdependence (NI), mutual information based on kernel estimation (KerMI) and cross correlation. Wavelet transform coherence (WTC) in α and β frequency bands followed BIS and C eff better than that in other frequency bands. There was a significant decrease in unconscious state and a significant increase in recovery state for PCMI and NI, while the trends were opposite for KerMI, DET and WTC. Phase synchronization based on phase locking value (PSPLV) in δ, θ, α and γ1 frequency bands dropped significantly in unconscious state, whereas it had no significant synchronization in recovery state. Moreover, PCMI, NI, DET correlated closely with each other and they had a better robustness to noise and higher correlation with BIS and C eff than other synchronization indexes. Propofol caused EEG synchronization changes during the anesthetic period. Different synchronization measures had individual properties in evaluating synchronization changes in different anesthetic states, which might be related to various forms of neural activities and neurophysiological mechanisms under general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26350675/

Secondary analysis included complications, patient clinical recovery, and post-procedure cognitive impairment.
Two hundred patients undergoing elective outpatient colonoscopy were randomized to light (bispectral index [BIS] 70-80) or deep (BIS < 60) sedation with propofol and fentanyl. Recall was assessed by the modified Brice questionnaire, and cognition at baseline and discharge was assessed using a Cogstate test battery.
The median (interquartile range [IQR]) BIS values were different in the two groups (69 [65-74] light sedation vs 53 [46-59] deep sedation; P < 0.0001). The incidence of recall was 12% in the light sedation group and 1% in the deep sedation group. The risk difference for recall was 0.11 (90% confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.17) in the intention-to-treat analysis, thus refuting equivalence in recall between light and deep sedation (0.05 significance level; 10% equivalence margin). Overall sedation-related complications were more frequent with deep sedation than with light sedation (66% vs 47%, respectively; P = 0.008). Recovery was more rapid with light sedation than with deep sedation as determined by the mean (SD) time to reach a score of 5 on the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale [3 (4) min vs 7 (4) min, respectively; P < 0.001] and by the median [IQR] time to readiness for hospital discharge (65 [57-80] min vs 74 [63-86] min, respectively; P = 0.001).

The administration route is also important and should be minimally invasive. In this study, we aimed to compare two different doses of intranasal dexmedetomidine applied to children for MRI sedation.
Sixty patients between 1 and 10 years of age with American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification I or II who were scheduled for MRI were recruited into this prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Intranasal dexmedetomidine was administered at doses of 3 µg kg(-1) (Group 1) and 4 µg kg(-1) (Group 2) before imaging. Heart rate (HR), peripheral oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) scores were recorded before the anaesthetic induction of sedation and every 10 min until discharge. If intranasal sedation failed, an intravenous cannula was placed and propofol was applied as a rescue anaesthetic. Bispectral Index (BIS) scores were also recorded before and after MRI. We recorded onset time of sedation, mood at separation from parents (defined as parental separation score), imaging quality, MRI duration, rescue anaesthetic requirement, total duration of sedation, recovery duration, parents' satisfaction and adverse effects.
The results related to age, weight and adverse effects were not statistically different between the groups. The parental separation score was significantly higher in Group 2 (P = 0.003). Rescue anaesthetic requirement was significantly higher in Group 1 (P = 0.002). The results related to recovery duration, MRI duration, parents' satisfaction, onset time of sedation and total duration of sedation were not statistically different. HR was significantly lower in all time intervals compared with basal values in both groups. In Group 2, RSS scores were significantly higher in the 30th, 40th and 50th min. The BIS scores in Group 2 were lower at the 50th min. Neither bradycardia nor oxygen desaturation were observed. Imaging studies were completed successfully in all patients.

This report is a secondary analysis of data from a prospective, controlled interventional study comparing the effect of sevoflurane administration guided by BIS monitoring (group SevoBIS) and constant administration of sevoflurane (group Sevo1.8Vol%) during CPB. Sevoflurane plasma concentration (SPC) was measured using gas chromatography. The relationships of BIS to SPC, CPB pump flow, arterial pressure, hematocrit, temperature, time on CPB, and patient characteristics were analysed.
No association was observed between BIS values and SPC in group SevoBIS. In group Sevo1.8Vol%, a 40 μg ml-1 increase in SPC, which encompassed the entire range of observed values of the SPC in this analysis, was associated with a decrease of 3.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-6.1) in BIS values (p = 0.005). Each increase in CPB time of 10 minutes was associated with an increase in BIS values of 0.25 (95%CI: 0.11-0.39, p<0.001).

Older groups required a lower target concentration of propofol (group A: median 2.1 μg/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 1.9-2.3]; group B: median 1.6 μg/mL [IQR, 1.3-1.8]; and group C: median 1.4 μg/mL [IQR, 1.2-1.6]; P < .0001). Hypotension tended to occur in the younger group, and hypoxemia occurred at a significantly higher rate in the older groups, although the number of cases was small. Low preoperative systolic blood pressure (≤125 mm Hg) was associated with hypotension (odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.70; P = .013) and abnormal pulmonary function was associated with hypoxemia in groups B and C (OR, 4.54; 95% CI, 1.01-31.5; P = .048).
Elderly patients required lower doses of propofol with the TCI/BIS system than younger patients. Attention to hypoxemia is necessary in elderly patients, particularly patients with abnormal pulmonary function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26301406/

An association between triple low and postoperative mortality has been reported but was not replicated in a subsequent study. The authors pooled existing data from clinical trials to further evaluate the purported association in an observational study.
This retrospective observational study included 13,198 patients from three clinical trials: B-Unaware, BAG-RECALL, and Michigan Awareness Control Study. Patients with greater than 15 not necessarily consecutive minutes of triple low were propensity matched to controls with similar characteristics and comorbidities. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the association between triple low duration and postoperative mortality.
Thirty-day mortality was 0.8% overall, 1.9% in the triple low cohort, and 0.4% in the nontriple low cohort (odds ratio, 5.16; 95% CI, 4.21 to 6.34). After matching and adjusting for comorbidities, cumulative duration of triple low was significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality at 30 days (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.11, per 15 min) and 90 days (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.11, per 15 min).
There is a weak independent association between the triple low state and postoperative mortality, and the propensity-matched analysis does not suggest that this is an epiphenomenon.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26267244/

Patients scheduled for elective orthopaedic surgery were enrolled. All patients received initial doses of 0.02 mg/kg intravenous midazolam. If the RSAS score did not reach 4, an additional 1-mg dose of midazolam was administered.

This study develops mechanism-based population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models for the cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) effects of intravenously (IV) and intranasally (IN) administered dexmedetomidine in healthy subjects.
Single doses of 84 μg of dexmedetomidine were given once IV and once IN to six healthy men. Plasma dexmedetomidine concentrations were measured for 10 h along with plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E). Blood pressure, heart rate, and CNS drug effects (three visual analog scales and bispectral index) were monitored to assess the pharmacological effects of dexmedetomidine. PK-PD modeling was performed for recently published data (Eur J Clin Pharmacol 67: 825, 2011).
Pharmacokinetic profiles for both IV and IN doses of dexmedetomidine were well fitted using a two-compartment PK model. Intranasal bioavailability was 82%. Dexmedetomidine inhibited the release of NE and E to induce their decline in blood. This decrease in NE was captured with an indirect response model. The concentrations of the mediator NE served via a biophase/transduction step and nonlinear pharmacologic functions to produce reductions in blood pressure and heart rate, while a direct effect model was used for the CNS effects.
The comprehensive panel of two biomarkers and seven response measures were well captured by the population PK/PD models. The subjects were more sensitive to the CNS (lower EC 50 values) than cardiovascular effects of dexmedetomidine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26233335/

We hypothesized that the elderly patients will require lower target concentration of both propofol and remifentanil at above two clinical end-points.
There were 80 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II unpremedicated patients enrolled in this study, they were divided into elderly group (age ≥65 years, n = 40) and young group (aged 18-64 years, n = 40). Propofol was initially given to a predicted blood concentration of 1.2 μg/ml and thereafter increased by 0.3 μg/ml every 30 s until Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score was 1. The propofol level was kept constant, and remifentanil was given to provide a predict blood concentration of 2.0 ng/ml, and then increased by 0.3 ng/ml every 30 s until loss of response to a tetanic stimulus. BIS (version 3.22, BIS Quattro sensor) was also recorded.
In elderly group, the propofol effect-site C 50 at LOC of was 1.5 (1.4-1.6) μg/ml, was significantly lower than that of young group, which was 2.2 (2.1-2.3) μg/ml, the remifentanil effect-site C 50 at LOS was 3.5 (3.3-3.7) ng/ml in elderly patients, was similar with 3.7 (3.6-3.8) ng/ml in young patients.

In preclinical studies, PHAX is a fast onset-offset IV anesthetic like propofol, but causes less cardiovascular depression. This first-in-man study was designed to find the anesthetic dose of PHAX and to compare it with an equivalent dose of propofol for safety, efficacy, and quality of recovery from anesthesia and sedation.
The study adhered to compliance with Good Clinical Practices regulations (clinical trials registry number, ACTRN12611000343909). This randomized, double-blind study compared PHAX and propofol using a Bayesian algorithm to determine dose equivalence for effects on the bispectral index (BIS). Male volunteers, ASA physical status I, gave written informed consent (n = 12 per group; PHAX or propofol). Parameters assessed for 80 minutes after drug injection (single bolus dose) were pain on injection, involuntary movement, BIS, blood pressure, need for airway support, and, as measures of recovery from sedation, the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Arterial blood was withdrawn for biochemistry, hematology, and complement levels.
No subject complained of pain on injection with PHAX, whereas 8 of the 12 subjects given propofol did. Nine PHAX and 8 propofol subjects reached BIS values of ≤50: median (interquartile range [IQR]) mg/kg dose = 0.5 (0.5-0.6) for PHAX and 2.9 (2.4-3.0) for propofol. The lowest median BIS reached was 27 to 28 for both agents with no significant differences between them for timing of onset and recovery of BIS. The concomitant median changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were -11% vs -19% for systolic and -25% vs -37% for diastolic in PHAX- and propofol-treated subjects, respectively. Nine of the 12 propofol-treated subjects and none of 12 PHAX-treated subjects required airway support. For subjects reaching an equivalent BIS of ≤50: a Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale score of 0 was reached at a median of 5 (IQR, 5-10) and 15 (IQR, 10-20) minutes after PHAX and propofol, respectively; BIS returned to 90 at a mean of 21 (SD, 10.1) and 21 (SD, 9.2) minutes after PHAX and propofol, respectively; and Digit Symbol Substitution Test scores returned to predrug injection values at median of 50 (IQR, 35-72.5) and 42.5 (IQR, 35-76.3) minutes after PHAX and propofol, respectively. There was no increase in C3 and C4 complement fractions after either drug.

The major objective of the current investigation was to compare the BIS Vista Index ability to track varying depths of sedation as determined by OASS scores in a standardized anesthetic regimen with and without ketamine. The study was a randomized, double blinded clinical trial. Patients undergoing breast surgery under sedation with propofol were randomized to receive ketamine (1.5 μg kg min(-1)) or saline. Infusion data was used to estimate propofol plasma concentrations (Cp). The main outcome of interest was the correlation between the BIS Vista Index with the OASS score. Twenty subjects were recruited and fifteen completed the study. Four hundred fifty-five paired data points were included in the analysis. Model performance (Nagelkerke R(2)) of the multinomial logistic regression model was 0.57 with the c-statistic of 0.87 (95 % CI 0.82-0.91).

With the rates of obesity in the general population increasing, more patients undergo bariatric surgery. The aim of this study was to compare the performance, effectiveness and recovery from anesthesia of sevoflurane and propofol in combination with remifentanil, with and without bispectral index (BIS) monitoring in super obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery.
In this prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled study a total of 100 super obese patients (body mass index, BMI > 50 kg/m2) undergoing bariatric surgery were randomly allocated in four groups: a sevoflurane group (n = 25), a sevoflurane with BIS monitoring group (n = 25), a propofol group (n=25) and a propofol with BIS monitoring group (n=25). Hemodynamic parameters, depth of anesthesia, recovery from anesthesia and postoperative pain were recorded.
The mean age of patients was 37.7 ± 9.2 years and the median BMI was 57.86 ± 9.33. There were no statistically significant differences between the four groups with respect to patient characteristics, comorbidities and duration of surgery. The intraoperatively mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in both propofol groups. No significant difference was observed between the four groups in respect to heart rate changes during anesthesia. Although the time to eye-opening and extubation was significantly shorter in both propofol groups, recovery from anesthesia, assessed with the Aldrete, Chung and White recovery scores, was significantly faster in sevoflurane groups. No significant difference was observed in postoperative pain between the four groups.
Although both propofol and sevoflurane provide adequate general anesthesia, sevoflurane may be preferable in super obese patients because of superior hemodynamic stability and faster recovery from anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26214787/

We randomized 124 mechanically ventilated adults following UPPP who were managed in the PACU of the General Hospital of the Shenyang Military Region between January 2014 and June 2014, to receive either dexmedetomidine or propofol. The patients in the propofol group received an infusion of propofol (3 mg/kg/h) titrated up to 6 mg/kg/h to attain a Ramsay sedation score ≥4. The dexmedetomidine group patients received 1.0 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine over a period of 10 minutes and then 0.5 to 1.0 μg/kg/h infusion to maintain a Ramsay sedation score ≥4.
Bispectral index (BIS) values were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group than in the propofol group at Ramsay sedation scores of 4 and 5. The mean times to spontaneous breathing, waking, and extubation were shorter in the dexmedetomidine group. Tramadol requirement was significantly reduced in the dexmedetomidine group (P<0.05). Incidence of cough during the extubation process in the propofol group was higher than in the dexmedetomidine group. After extubation, Bruggemann comfort scale (BCS) and Rass agitation scores (RASS) were decreased in the dexmedetomidine-sedated patients.

26174308,Response of bispectral index to neuromuscular block in awake volunteers.,British journal of anaesthesia,2015,"Schuller PJ, Newell S, Strickland PA, Barry JJ","The bispectral index (BIS) monitor is a quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) device that is widely used to assess the hypnotic component of anaesthesia, especially when neuromuscular blocking drugs are used. It has been shown that the BIS is sensitive to changes in electromyogram (EMG) activity in anaesthetized patients. A single study using an earlier version of the BIS showed that decreased EMG activity caused the BIS to decrease even in awake subjects, to levels that suggested deep sedation and anaesthesia.
We administered suxamethonium and rocuronium to 10 volunteers who were fully awake, to determine whether the BIS decreased in response to neuromuscular block alone. An isolated forearm technique was used for communication during the experiment. Two versions of the BIS monitor were used, both of which are in current use. Sugammadex was used to antagonise the neuromuscular block attributable to rocuronium.
The BIS decreased after the onset of neuromuscular block in both monitors, to values as low as 44 and 47, and did not return to pre-test levels until after the return of movement. The BIS showed a two-stage decrease, with an immediate reduction to values around 80, and then several minutes later, a sharp decrease to lower values. In some subjects, there were periods where the BIS was <60 for several minutes. The response was similar for both suxamethonium and rocuronium. Neither monitor was consistently superior in reporting the true state of awareness.
These results suggest that the BIS monitor requires muscle activity, in addition to an awake EEG, in order to generate values indicating that the subject is awake. Consequently, BIS may be an unreliable indicator of awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking drugs.

Target controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil was used for anesthetic induction and maintenance, and adjusted in order to maintain a bispectral index of 40-55 and hemodynamic stability. We measured hemodynamics and recorded total and mean infused dosages of propofol and remifentanil. For anesthesia induction and maintenance, mean infused doses of propofol (121 ± 27 vs. 144 ± 29 μg/kg/min, P = 0.04) and remifentanil (118 ± 27 vs. 150 ± 36 ng/kg/min, P = 0.01) were lower in the dexmedetomidine group than in the control group, respectively. The dexmedetomidine group required 16 % less propofol and 23 % less remifentanil.

Most surgeons decide the depth of penetration of the prosthesis by monitoring the voice changes in the patient during the surgical procedure. General anesthesia with intubation is incompatible with this procedure. Sedation is recommended. In this study we want to objectivize and quantify the influence of sedation and position on voice in order to know if this anesthetic procedure is justified in medialization thyroplasties.
A prospective study.
This study involved 15 adult patients who underwent sedation. Voice recordings were performed in each patient in three different positions and conditions: the seated position without sedation, the supine position without sedation, and the supine position under the effects of sedation. The sedation drugs used were midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol. The level of sedation was monitored using the observational scale and the bispectral index.
The acoustic data obtained from sustained vowel sounds from patient recordings showed that sedation significantly affected the values of pitch. Compared to recordings from patients without sedation, pitch values in patients under sedation were significantly higher for jitter local and shimmer local recordings and significantly lower for pitch and harmonics-to-noise ratio. The supine position was shown not to influence on the voice.
Sedation exerts an important influence on voice quality. General anesthesia could be an alternative, focusing our attention on monitoring the glottis with a fibrolaryngoscope during the surgical procedure. No sedation at all can also be an alternative.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26134182/

Our primary objective in this phase 1, single-center, open-label study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AZD3043 after IV infusion and to estimate the maximal tolerated dose. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of AZD3043 pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy. Sequential ascending-dose cohorts of 5 or 6 healthy male volunteers aged 18 to 45 years received a single 30-minute IV infusion of AZD3043. Assessments included adverse events, vital signs, blood gases, laboratory values, clinical signs of sedation/anesthesia, and bispectral index.
Fifty-three subjects received AZD3043 in infusion rate cohorts of 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, and 81 mg/kg/h.

Adverse events occurring in >1 subject were headache (n = 4), erythema (n = 3), chest discomfort (n = 2), nausea (n = 2), and dyspnea (n = 2). The frequency and character of adverse events appeared unrelated to dose. There were no spontaneous reports of pain on injection and no clinically relevant changes in respiratory rate or arterial blood pressure. However, heart rate increased dose-dependently at infusion rates >18 mg/kg/h. Occurrence of sedation/anesthesia corresponded with dose; the lowest applied infusion rate to induce anesthesia according to clinical signs of sedation/anesthesia at predefined time points was 12 mg/kg/h (1 of 6 subjects anesthetized), and all subjects in the 3 highest dose groups were anesthetized. The onset of anesthesia ranged from 4 minutes in the highest infusion rate group to 29 minutes in the 12-mg/kg/h infusion rate group. Return of response to oral command occurred at 3 minutes after the end of infusion in the single subject who was anesthetized in the 12-mg/kg/h group and median 25 minutes in the 81-mg/kg/h group.

All patients then received 5 μg sufentanil and 2 mg midazolam, while titrated to maintain the BIS value at 40 to 50, before the muscle relaxation exhibited complete recovery.
The mean duration of treatment process takes approximately 82.5 minutes. Mean (SD) seizure length was 58.8 (28.3) seconds, with 4.5% incidence of restimulation per treatment. Incidence of awareness was 0%. No patients exhibited delirium, nausea, vomiting, or myalgia in the postseizure phase.

26005336,A quest to increase safety of anesthetics by advancements in anesthesia monitoring: scientometric analysis.,"Drug design, development and therapy",2015,"Vlassakov KV, Kissin I","The aim of this study was to assess progress in the field of anesthesia monitoring over the past 40 years using scientometric analysis. The following scientometric indexes were used: popularity indexes (general and specific), representing the proportion of articles on either a topic relative to all articles in the field of anesthetics (general popularity index, GPI) or the subfield of anesthesia monitoring (specific popularity index, SPI); index of change (IC), representing the degree of growth in publications on a topic from one period to the next; and index of expectations (IE), representing the ratio of the number of articles on a topic in the top 20 journals relative to the number of articles in all (>5,000) biomedical journals covered by PubMed. Publications on 33 anesthesia-monitoring topics were assessed. Our analysis showed that over the past 40 years, the rate of rise in the number of articles on anesthesia monitoring was exponential, with an increase of more than eleven-fold, from 296 articles over the 5-year period 1974-1978 to 3,394 articles for 2009-2013. This rise profoundly exceeded the rate of rise of the number of articles on general anesthetics. The difference was especially evident with the comparison of the related GPIs: stable growth of the GPI for anesthesia monitoring vs constant decline in the GPI for general anesthetics. By the 2009-2013 period, among specific monitoring topics introduced after 1980, the SPI index had a meaningful magnitude (≥1.5) in 9 of 24 topics: Bispectral Index (7.8), Transesophageal Echocardiography (4.2), Electromyography (2.8), Pulse Oximetry (2.4), Entropy (2.3), Train-of-four (2.3), Capnography (1.9), Pulse Contour (1.9), and Electrical Nerve Stimulation for neuromuscular monitoring (1.6). Only one of these topics (Pulse Contour) demonstrated (in 2009-2013) high values for both IC and IE indexes (76 and 16.9, respectively), indicating significant recent progress. We suggest that rapid growth in the field of anesthetic monitoring was one of the most important developments to compensate for the intrinsically low margins of safety of anesthetic agents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26005336/
25993386,Rationale and Design of the Balanced Anesthesia Study: A Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial of Two Levels of Anesthetic Depth on Patient Outcome After Major Surgery.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2015,"Short TG, Leslie K, Chan MT, Campbell D, Frampton C, Myles P","An association between relatively deep anesthesia, as guided by the bispectral index (BIS), and increased postoperative mortality has been demonstrated in 6 of 8 published observational studies, but association does not necessarily mean causality. Small clinical trials of anesthetic depth have demonstrated increased delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients who were relatively deeply anesthetized, but have been inadequately powered to study mortality. A large-scale randomized study is required to determine whether causality exists.
The primary hypothesis of our study is that ""light"" anesthesia, defined as a BIS target of 50, will reduce all-cause mortality within 1 year of surgery in comparison with ""deep"" anesthesia, defined as a BIS target of 35, in patients aged ≥60 years presenting for major surgery under general anesthesia. The trial is an international multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind (patients and investigators) prospective, intention-to-treat, safety and efficacy study. The relative reduction in mortality in the light anesthesia group is expected to be 20%, giving an absolute risk reduction from 10% to 8%. Power analysis using a = 0.049 and b = 0.2 indicates that 3250 patients are required in each group.
The study is underway, and 1325 patients have been recruited in 40 centers in 5 countries. It is anticipated that the study will be completed in 3 years.
This randomized controlled trial should definitively answer the question of whether titrating anesthetic depth makes a difference to patient outcome in a vulnerable patient group.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25993386/

Ninety patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and 18 snorers underwent polysomnography and DISE under bispectral index (BIS)-guided propofol infusion at two different sedation levels: BIS 65-75 (light sedation) and 50-60 (deep sedation).
For the patients with OSA, the percentages of velopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx obstructions under light sedation were 77.8%, 63.3%, 30%, and 33.3%, respectively. Sedation depth was associated with the severity of velopharynx and oropharynx obstruction, oropharynx obstruction pattern, tongue base obstruction, epiglottis anteroposterior prolapse and folding, and arytenoid prolapse. In comparison, OSA severity was associated with the severity of velopharynx obstruction, severity of oropharynx obstruction, and arytenoid prolapse (odds ratio (95% confidence interval); 14.3 (4.7-43.4), 11.7 (4.2-32.9), and 13.2 (2.8-62.3), respectively). A good agreement was noted between similar DISE findings at different times and different observers (kappa value 0.6 to 1, respectively). A high percentage of arytenoid prolapse (46.7% among the patients with OSA under light sedation) was noted.
Greater sedative depth increased upper airway collapsibility under DISE assessment. DISE under BIS-guided propofol infusion, and especially a level of 65-75, offers an objective and reproducible method to evaluate upper airway collapsibility. Some findings were induced by drug sedation and need careful interpretation. Specific arytenoid prolapse patterns were noted for which further investigations are warranted.

The purpose of this study was to determine the 50% effective dose (ED50) of single-dose DMT to induce adequate light sedation in elderly patients in comparison with younger patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) with spinal anesthesia.
Forty-two male patients were recruited. The young age group (Group Y) included patients 45 to 64 years old and the old age group (Group O) included patients 65 to 78 years old. After the spinal anesthesia was performed, a pre-calculated dose of DMT was administered for 10 min. The Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale, bispectral index score (BIS) were assessed then at 2-min intervals for 20 min. A modified Dixon's up-and-down method was used to determine the ED50 of the drug for light sedation (OAA/S score 3/4). In the recovery room, regression times of the motor and sensory blocks were recorded.
The ED50 of DMT was 0.25 (95% C.I. 0.15-0.35) μg/kg in Group O and 0.35 (95% C.I. 0.35-0.45) μg/kg in Group Y (p = 0.002). The ED95 was 33% lower in Group O compare with Group Y (0.38 (95% C.I. 0.29-0.39) μg/kg vs. 0.57 (95% C.I. 0.49-0.59) μg/kg). The regression time of sensory block was longer in Group O than in Group Y (109.0 ± 40.2 min vs. 80.0 ± 31.6 min) (p = 0.014).
The single-dose of DMT for light sedation was lower by 21% in Group O compare with Group Y underwent TURP with spinal anesthesia.

25970339,The effects of bispectral index monitoring on hemodynamics and recovery profile in developmentally delayed pediatric patients undergoing dental surgery.,Paediatric anaesthesia,2015,"Sargin M, Uluer MS, Ozmen S","General anesthesia is often preferred for dental surgery or rehabilitation in developmentally delayed pediatric patients. Bispectral index monitoring is used to monitor the depth of anesthesia and to ensure early recovery. However, studies on the topic in developmentally delayed pediatric patients are limited.
To evaluate the effects of Bispectral Index Scale (BIS) on hemodynamics and recovery profile in developmentally delayed pediatric patients undergoing dental surgery.
Forty children between the ages of 6-16 years were studied in this prospective and randomized study. The children were randomized into two groups. In Group 1 (n = 20), general anesthesia was maintained with 1-2 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane in oxygen by standard practice. In Group 2 (n = 20), the depth of anesthesia was monitored by BIS. BIS values were continuously recorded from awake status to tracheal extubation. The duration of the surgical procedure, anesthesia, postanesthesia care unit (PACU) stay was noted. To evaluate recovery profile, time to spontaneous ventilation, extubation, open eyes, and PACU discharge were also noted.
There were significant differences between recovery times and Non-communicating Children's Pain Checklist - Postoperative Version (NCCPC-PV) scores of two groups. Time to spontaneous ventilation [Difference in means (95% CI); 3.17 (1.79-4.54) P < 0.001], extubation [Difference in means (95% CI); 3.13 (1.66-4.60) P < 0.001], open eyes [Difference in means (95% CI); 3.97 (2.34-5.59) P < 0.001], and PACU stay time [Difference in means (95% CI); 23.55 (18.08-29.01) P < 0.001] were significantly shorter in Group 2.

Although observation of pain behaviors (e.g., frowning) is recommended for pain assessment in nonverbal populations, they are attenuated and sometimes even suppressed in patients with TBI receiving high doses of sedatives. This study explored the potential utility of the bilateral bispectral index system (BIS) for pain detection in critically ill adults with TBI and altered level of consciousness.
Using a repeated measure within-subject design, participants (N = 25) were observed for 1 minute before (baseline), during, and 15 minutes after two procedures: (a) noninvasive blood pressure (nonnociceptive) and (b) turning (nociceptive). At each assessment, BIS indexes (0-100) of the right (R) and left (L) hemispheres and pain behaviors were documented.
Compared with baseline, significant median increases (p ≤ .05) in BIS-R (+4.93%) and BIS-L (+8.43%) and in the frequency of pain behaviors (+3.00) were observed during turning but not noninvasive blood pressure. Interestingly, increases in BIS-R were more pronounced in participants with left-sided TBI (+17.23%, p = .021) than those with right-sided TBI (+3.01%). BIS-R fluctuations in participants with left-sided TBI were also positively correlated (r(s) = .986, p ≤ .001) with the frequency of pain behaviors observed during turning.
Overall, only increases in BIS-R were correlated with participants' pain behaviors and in those with left-sided TBI exclusively. Although further research is needed, our findings support the potential use of the bilateral BIS for pain detection in nonverbal patients with TBI who cannot behaviorally respond to pain, but only when they have a left-sided injury.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25943998/

In a blinded clinical trial, 92 patients scheduled for supratentorial craniotomy under general anaesthesia were randomly allocated into either a multipoint TEAS (n=46) or a sham TEAS group (n=46). All patients received total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and sufentanil. The target concentration of sufentanil was adjusted and recorded according to mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and bispectral index (BIS). Patients in the TEAS group received TEAS 30 min before anaesthesia induction and this was maintained throughout the operation at four pairs of acupuncture points. Postoperative pain, recovery and side effects were evaluated.
Eighty-eight patients completed the study. Continuous monitoring of MAP, HR and BIS showed stable values with no significant differences between the two groups (p>0.05). Sufentanil target plasma concentration in TEAS patients was significantly lower at some time points during supratentorial craniotomy, and total sufentanil consumption was significantly higher in the sham group (p<0.05). Postoperative recovery and pain were significantly improved by TEAS (p<0.001), without the postoperative side effects.
Multipoint TEAS at both proximal and distal points combined with TIVA can significantly decrease intraoperative sufentanil requirements, increase pain relief on postoperative day 1 and improve postoperative recovery of patients during supratentorial tumour resection, with no significant increase of side effects. These findings suggest that multipoint TEAS may be clinically effective as an adjunct to analgesia in intraoperative anaesthesia and postoperative pain treatment and may speed recovery.

However, the quantification of analgesia still remains an open problem. The purpose of this work is to improve the prediction of nociceptive responses with linear and non-linear measures calculated from EEG signal filtered in frequency bands higher than the traditional bands. Power spectral density and auto-mutual information function was applied in order to predict the presence or absence of the nociceptive responses to different stimuli during sedation in endoscopy procedure. The proposed measures exhibit better performances than the bispectral index (BIS).

Effect-site concentration (Ce) targets to induce general anesthesia with this model in children have not been described. The aim of this study was to identify propofol Ce targets associated with success rates of 50% (Ce50) and 95% (Ce95) among children 3-11 years of age.
Forty-two children were assigned to one of seven groups of six patients each according to propofol target Ce. After fentanyl administration propofol TCI was started with an assigned Ce target. A successful response was defined as loss of eyelash reflex and bispectral index < 50, 45 s after reaching the assigned Ce. Logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate propofol Ce50 and Ce95.
Twenty-eight children had a successful response with the assigned propofol Ce. In these patients, a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (79-59, P < 0.0001) and in heart rate (95-83, P < 0.0001) was observed. Propofol Ce and age showed a statistically significant effect in the logistic regression model.

A nasal high-flow (NHF) system has been reported to achieve effective oxygenation in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. This study investigated the ability of the NHF system to prevent hypoxia in dental patients under IVS.
Thirty patients scheduled for dental treatment under IVS were enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: patients spontaneously breathing oxygen at 5 L/minute through a nasal cannula (NC5 group), patients administered oxygen at 30 L/minute through the NHF system, and patients administered oxygen at 50 L/minute through the NHF system. Hypnosis was induced by bolus administration of midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) followed by continuous administration of propofol (target blood concentration, 1.2 to 2 μg/mL). Noninvasive blood pressure, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate, and bispectral index values were recorded every 2.5 minutes before the induction of anesthesia. Interventions, such as jaw lifting, were recorded during IVS and arterial blood gas analysis was performed at the end of sedation. Patient and surgeon satisfaction with IVS was evaluated by interview.
Minimum SpO2 was lowest in and surgeons were least satisfied with the NC5 group. In addition, interventions were required most frequently in the NC5 group (P < .05). Compared with the NC5 group, use of the NHF system improved partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in dental patients under IVS (P < .05).
These results suggest that use of the NHF system can prevent hypoxia in dental patients under IVS. Further studies are necessary to determine the appropriate flow rate and indications for NHF in obese patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25799356/

It is widely used in China for such complex operations as brain, heart, and abdominal surgery. It is popular in China because it is economical, practical, and beneficial to the patients. With acupuncture anesthesia there is less bleeding during surgery and there is also quicker post-operative recovery.
This randomized prospective study aims at comparing the effect of two acupoints (Yongquan, KI1 and Renzhong, DU26) with sham acupuncture and no acupuncture on the time to recovery of consciousness after general anesthesia by means of the Bispectral Index monitor (BIS).
This is a prospective randomized controlled study. We randomly assigned 50 patients to 5 groups during recovery from surgical anesthesia. Four groups had acupuncture on KI1 (group A), DU26 (groups B), both KI1 and DU26 (group C), and sham points (group D), and one had no acupuncture (group E).
Bispectral Index (BIS), time to spontaneous eye opening, time to tracheal extubation, and time to following commands were measured as the main outcome measures.
Time to spontaneous eye opening differed among groups (P=0.002), as well as time to tracheal extubation (P<0.000 1) and time to following commands (P=0.000 6). BIS values differed significantly among groups both 5 and 10 min after the end of anesthesia (P<0.000 1 and P=0.000 4, respectively). BIS values of groups D and E were lower than those of the other groups and those of group C were higher. The same pattern was observed also 15 and 30 min after the end of anesthesia, although the difference among groups was not significant at these time points (P=0.164 and P=0.104, respectively).
Acupuncture on DU26 and KI1 accelerates recovery of consciousness after general anesthesia. Moreover, a possible synergistic effect of DU26 and KI1 is suggested. This issue may play a role in the optimization of operating room management and raise interest about the usefulness of acupuncture on unconsciousness states of different nature.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25797640/

25790208,Anesthetic management during cardiopulmonary bypass: a systematic review.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2015,"Barry AE, Chaney MA, London MJ","Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) required for cardiac surgery presents unique challenges to the cardiac anesthesiologist responsible for providing the 3 most basic facets of any anesthetic: amnesia, analgesia, and muscle relaxation. Unique pathophysiologic changes during CPB result in pharmacokinetic alterations that impact the serum and tissue concentrations of IV and volatile anesthetics. Similarly, CPB causes pharmacodynamic alterations that impact anesthetic efficacy. The clinical significance of these alterations represents a ""moving target"" as practice evolves and the technology of CPB circuitry advances. In addition, perfusionists choose, modify, and maintain the CPB circuitry and membrane oxygenator. Thus, their significance may not be fully appreciated by the anesthesiologist. These issues have a profound impact on the anesthetic state of the patient. The delivery and maintenance of anesthesia during CPB present unique challenges. The perfusionist may be directly responsible for the delivery of anesthetic during CPB, a situation unique to the cardiac suite. In addition, monitors of anesthetic depth-assessment of clinical signs, hemodynamic indicators, the bispectral index monitor, end-tidal anesthetic concentration, or twitch monitoring-are often absent, unreliable, or directly impacted by the unique pathophysiology associated with CPB. The magnitude of these challenges is reflected in the higher incidence of intraoperative awareness during cardiac surgery. Further complicating matters are the lack of specific clinical guidelines and varying international policies regarding medical device specifications that add further layers of complexity and introduce practice variability both within institutions and among nations. We performed a systematic survey of the literature to identify where anesthetic practice during CPB is evidence based (or not), identify gaps in the literature to guide future investigations, and explore the implications of evolving surgical practice, perfusion techniques, and national policies that impact amnesia, analgesia, and muscle relaxation during CPB.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25790208/

This is a prospective observational study in 61 critical children undergoing invasive procedures. Hemodynamic data (heart rate and arterial blood pressure), clinical scales punctuation (Ramsay, COMFORT, and numeric rating pain scales), BIS, and the number of fluctuations of SC per second were collected before, during, and at the end of the procedure.
The mean age of the patients was 42.9 (range, 1 month to 16 years). Seventy-two point six percent were postcardiac surgery patients. Nonmuscle-relaxed patients showed a moderate increase in heart rate (P = .02), numeric rating pain scales (P = .03), and Ramsay scale (P = .002). The number of fluctuations of SC per second increased significantly during the procedure (basal, 0.1; maneuver, 0.2; P = .015), but it never reached the level considered as pain or stress nor did it precede clinical scales or BIS. None of the variables studied showed a significant change during the procedure in muscle-relaxed patients.

Presently, dexmedetomidine is used as an adjuvant for propofol-based TIVA. We compared the effects of remifentanil and dexmedetomidine on pain intensity as well as the analgesic requirements after post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge in patients undergoing spinal surgery.
Forty patients scheduled for posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. Anesthesia was maintained using propofol at 3-12 mg/kg/h and remifentanil at 0.01-0.2 μg/kg/min in Remifentanil group or dexmedetomidine at 0.01-0.02 μg/kg/min in Dexmedetomidine group, keeping the bispectral index between 40 and 60. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) made of hydromophone was applied once the patients opened their eyes in the PACU. The visual analog scale (VAS) score, PCA dosage administered, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were recorded at the time of discharge from the PACU (T1) and at 2 (T2), 8 (T3), 24 (T4), and 48 hours (T5) after surgery.
The VAS score in Remifentanil group was significantly higher than that in Dexmedetomidine group at immediate and late postoperative period (4.1 ± 2.0 vs. 2.3 ± 2.2 at T1, and 4.0 ± 2.2 vs. 2.6 ± 1.7 at T5; P < 0.05). Dexmedtomidine group had a statistically significantly lower PCA requirement at every time point after surgery except directly before discharge from the PACU (3.0 ± 1.2 ml vs. 2.3 ± 1.4 ml at T1; P > 0.05, but 69.7 ± 21.4 ml vs. 52.8 ± 10.8 ml at T5; P < 0.05). Patients in Remifentanil group displayed more PONV until 24 hours post-surgery.
Dexmedetomidine displayed superior efficacy in alleviating pain and in postoperative pain management for 48 hours after PLIF. Therefore, dexmedetomidine may be used instead of remifentanil as an adjuvant in propofol-based TIVA.

Nevertheless, the clinical implications of this phenomenon in red-haired patients undergoing surgery are currently unknown.
In a secondary analysis of a prospective trial of intraoperative awareness, red-haired patients were identified and matched with five control patients, and the relative risk for intraoperative awareness was determined. Overall anesthetic management between groups was compared using Hotelling's T(2) statistic. Inhaled anesthetic requirements were compared between cohorts by evaluating the relationship between end-tidal anesthetic concentration and the bispectral index with a linear mixed-effects model. Time to recovery was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and differences in postoperative pain and nausea/vomiting were evaluated with Chi square tests.
A cohort of 319 red-haired patients was matched with 1,595 control patients for a sample size of 1,914. There were no significant differences in the relative risk of intraoperative awareness (relative risk = 1.67; 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 8.22), anesthetic management, recovery times, or postoperative pain between red-haired patients and control patients. The relationship between pharmacokinetically stable volatile anesthetic concentrations and bispectral index values differed significantly between red-haired patients and controls (P < 0.001), but without clinical implications.
There were no demonstrable differences between red-haired patients and controls in response to anesthetic and analgesic agents or in recovery parameters. These findings suggest that perioperative anesthetic and analgesic management should not be altered based on self-reported red-hair phenotype.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25681040/

The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of our sedation protocol for peroral DBE, which consisted of target-controlled infusion (TCI) anesthesia with propofol, an intravenous bolus of pentazocine, and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring.
A total of 34 consecutive patients who underwent DBE by the oral approach were enrolled. Patients were primarily sedated with a continuous infusion of propofol and adjusted in accordance with the BIS levels. The bolus infusion of pentazocine was performed when the propofol infusion was insufficient. The primary outcome measure of this study was to ensure the safety and efficacy of this sedation technique. The secondary purpose was to identify the characteristics of the patient who required the bolus infusion of pentazocine.
Five patients (14.7%) required a reduction in the dose of propofol. However, no patient experienced any serious adverse events. All patients (100%) and 80.6% (25/31) of endoscopists answered that the sedation protocol was 'excellent' or 'enough' for peroral DBE. Eleven patients (32.3%) required a bolus injection of pentazocine. Age <60 years and a total procedure time of >70 min were significant risk-factors for pentazocine use.
A combination of propofol via TCI pump, bolus injection of pentazocine as needed, and BIS monitoring was a safe and effective procedure for peroral DBE. Reasonable satisfaction indices were obtained from both patients and endoscopists. Pentazocine was required for young patients and in cases with longer procedure times.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25677385/

Appropriate management of cerebral oxygenation is thus one of the primary goals of anesthetic management during such procedures. The present report describes the case of a 65-year-old male patient, in which both bispectral index (BIS) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) were used to monitor cerebral oxygenation. During the positioning, we observed an increased suppression ratio (SR) while BIS and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) were at adequate level. In view of the difference in blood pressure between the heart and the base of the brain, blood pressure was maintained to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion. Although intraoperative rSO2 was at or around the cut-off point (a 12% relative decrease from baseline), no marked decrease in BIS or further increase in the SR was observed.

This study seeks to answer the question: ""To what degree can EEG suppression and burst count as measured by diagnostic EEG during drug-induced coma be predicted from data obtained from the BIS such as BIS value, suppression ratio (SR), and burst count?""
During drug-induced coma, cortical EEG is the gold standard for real-time monitoring and drug titration. Diagnostic EEG is, from setup through data analysis, labor intensive, costly, and difficult to maintain uniform clinician competency. BIS monitoring is less expensive, less labor-intensive, and easier to interpret data and establish/maintain competency. Validating BIS data versus diagnostic EEG facilitates effective brain monitoring during drug-induced coma at lower cost with similar outcomes.
This is a prospective, observational cohort study. Four consecutive patients receiving drug-induced coma/EEG monitoring were enrolled. BIS was initiated after informed consent. Variables recorded per minute included presence or absence of EEG burst suppression, burst count, BIS value over time, burst count, and SR. Pearson's product-moment and Spearman rank coefficient for BIS value and SR versus burst count were performed. Regression analysis was utilized to plot BIS values versus bursts/minute on EEG as well as SR versus burst count on EEG. EEG/BIS data were collected from digital data files and transcribed onto data sheets for corresponding time indices.
Four patients yielded 1,972 data sets over 33 hours of EEG/BIS monitoring. Regression coefficient of 0.6673 shows robust predictive value between EEG burst count and BIS SR. Spearman rank coefficient of -0.8727 indicates strong inverse correlation between EEG burst count and BIS SR. Pearson's correlation coefficient between EEG versus BIS burst count was .8256 indicating strong positive correlation. Spearman's rank coefficient of 0.8810 and Pearson's correlation coefficient of .6819 showed strong correlation between BIS value versus EEG burst count. Number of patients (4) limits available statistics and ability to generalize results. Graphs and statistics show strong correlation/predictive value for BIS parameters to EEG suppression.
This study is the first to measure correlation and predictive value between BIS monitoring and diagnostic EEG for degree of EEG suppression and burst count in the adult population. Available statistic tests and graphing of variables from BIS and diagnostic EEG show strong correlation and predictive value between both monitoring technologies during drug-induced coma. These support using BIS value, SR, and burst count to predict degree of EEG suppression in real time for titrating metabolic suppression therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25629593/

We, therefore, investigated the effects on cerebral circulation of flumazenil administered after midazolam, to test our hypothesis that, along with complete reversal of sedation, flumazenil antagonizes the alterations in cerebral circulation induced by midazolam.
Sixteen healthy young male subjects received midazolam followed by flumazenil. The modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale and bispectral index (BIS) were used to assess levels of sedation/awareness. For evaluation of cerebral circulation, steady-state mean cerebral blood flow velocity (MCBFV) was measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. In addition, dynamic cerebral autoregulation was assessed by spectral and transfer function analysis between mean arterial pressure (MAP) variability and MCBFV variability.
During midazolam sedation, defined by an OAA/S score of 3 (responds only after name is called loudly and/or repeatedly), BIS, steady-state MAP, steady-state CBFV, and transfer function gain decreased significantly compared with baseline. After flumazenil administration, an OAA/S score of 5 (responds readily to name spoken in a normal tone) was confirmed. Then, BIS and MAP returned to the same level as baseline. However, steady-state MCBFV showed a further significant decrease compared with that under midazolam sedation, and the decreased transfer function gain persisted.
Contrary to our hypothesis, the present results suggest that despite complete antagonism of the sedative effects of midazolam, flumazenil would not reverse the alterations in cerebral circulation induced by midazolam.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25602623/

The induction doses of propofol and plasma concentration of propofol and lidocaine were significantly higher in Group IV than in Groups EL or ET.
Epidural and IV lidocaine reduce the dose of propofol required to induce general anesthesia. Administration of lidocaine via the epidural route reduces anesthetic requirements more so than the IV route. Propofol requirements were further reduced in patients with higher sensory epidural block.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25439415/
25439399,Impact of isoproterenol infusion on BIS and metabolic values in pediatric patients undergoing electrophysiology studies.,Journal of clinical anesthesia,2014,"Gautam NK, Rafique MB, Numan MT","To study changes in BIS values and metabolic parameters during an infusion of isoproterenol in pediatric patients.
Retrospective study approved By Committee For The Protection Of Human Subjects at University Of Texas Medical School at Houston.
University-affiliated children's hospital.
The records of pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia for electrophysiology procedures were analyzed. Electronic data collected included Bispectral Index (BIS) values, anesthetics (eg, opioids, expired concentration of inhaled anesthetics, muscle relaxants), hemodynamic values (ie, heart rate, invasive blood pressure), respiratory parameters [ie, tidal volume, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2)], and routine arterial blood gases. These parameters were analyzed 10 minutes prior to the start of the isoproterenol infusion (T-pre) and 10 minutes after isoproterenol had reduced the cardiac cycle length by 20% (T-infusion).
Of the 29 records that were screened, 22 met the above criteria (mean age 13 ± 5 yrs). BIS values increased by an average of 8 (33 ± 8 to 41 ± 10; P < 0.001) during the isoproterenol infusion. Statistically significant increases in ETCO2 (median 33 - 36 mmHg; P = 0.01), PaCO2 (35 - 38 mmHg; P = 0.002), and lactate (1.1 -1.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001) occurred with infusion of isoproterenol. Patients undergoing controlled mechanical ventilation showed an increase in ETCO2 (mean 34 ± 6 mmHg to 37 ± 5 mmHg; P = 0.001) whereas those breathing spontaneously had an increase in minute ventilation (average increase 111 ± 30 mL/kg).
Isoproterenol increases metabolic, respiratory, and BIS values in pediatric patients during general anesthesia. We recommend the use of BIS, close monitoring of ETCO2, and careful titration of anesthetics during isoproterenol infusion, especially when lighter planes of general anesthesia are requested for pediatric electrophysiologic procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25439399/

While sedation assessment is well established in critical care in general, there is only little data available relating to the special conditions during patient transport and their effect on patient sedation levels. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the feasibility and relationship of clinical sedation assessment (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS)) and objective physiological monitoring (bispectral index (BIS)) during patient transfers in our Mobile-ICU.
The levels of sedation of 30 pharmacologically sedated patients were evaluated at 12 to 17 distinct measurement points spread strategically over the course of a transfer by use of the RASS and BIS. To investigate the relation between the RASS and the BIS, Spearman's squared rank correlation coefficient (ρ(2)) and the Kendall's rank correlation coefficient (τ) were calculated. The diagnostic value of the BIS with respect to the RASS was investigated by its sensitivity and positive predictive value for possible patient awakening. Therefore, measurements were dichotomized considering a clinically sensible threshold of 80 for BIS-values and classifying RASS values being nonnegative.
Spearman's rank correlation resulted to ρ(2) = 0.431 (confidence interval (CI) = 0.341 to 0.513). The Kendall's correlation coefficient was calculated as τ = 0.522 (CI = 0.459 to 0.576). Awakening of patients (RASS ≥ 0) was detected by a BIS value of 80 and above with a sensitivity of 0.97 (CI = 0.89 to 1.00) and a positive predictive value of 0.59 (CI = 0.45 to 0.71).
Our study demonstrates that the BIS-Monitor can be used for the assessment of sedation levels in the intricate environment of a Mobile-ICU, especially when well-established clinical scores as the RASS are impracticable. The use of BIS is highly sensitive in the detection of unwanted awakening of patients during transfers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25418521/

Three-arm, double-blinded randomised controlled trial.
Aretaieio University Hospital, February 2011 to July 2013.
One hundred and eighty adults aged between 45 and 75 years.
Deep sedation with propofol (target bispectral index 40 to 70) was performed. In the remifentanil group (R), patients received intranasal placebo before ERCP, and remifentanil 0.1 ml kg(-1) h(-1) (concentration 10 μg ml(-1)) during ERCP. In the fentanyl group (F), patients received intranasal fentanyl 200 μg before ERCP and placebo during ERCP. In the placebo group (P), patients received intranasal placebo before ERCP and placebo during ERCP.
The primary outcome was total propofol requirement. Secondary outcomes were recovery [assessed using the Ramsay Sedation Scale score and Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Score (OAAS)] at 30 min; postoperative pain [assessed using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS; 0 to 100 mm)]; and cognitive function [assessed using a MiniMental state test (max. 25 points) 30 min before and 30 min after ERCP].
Fifty-seven patients were included in group R, 59 in group F and 57 in group P. Propofol requirements for deep sedation were similar in all groups (13 mg kg(-1); P = 0.97). Ramsay Sedation Scale scores and OAAS scores were similar in all groups (P = 0.18 and P = 0.55, respectively). Postoperative median pain VAS differed among the groups (P = 0.007): 10 in group R, 0 in group F, five in group P. Cognitive function was high pre and postprocedure (median MiniMental state test 23 to 24) and not different among the groups.
The addition of pre or intraprocedural opioids had no effect on propofol requirement for deep sedation, but patients who received fentanyl had less minor pain.

Forty anxious dental patients referred to the sedation suite at Cardiff University School of Dentistry received either nitrous oxide to a maximum concentration of 40% or sevoflurane to a maximum concentration of 0.3% for a routine maxillary plastic restoration with articaine infiltration local analgesia. The inhalation sedation agent to be administered was chosen by a random number allocator. Measurements of blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate and bispectral index were recorded every 5 minutes. At the end of the treatment episode the patient, the operator and an observer who was unaware of the agent used, recorded their impressions about the episode by completing questionnaires.
In the doses used in this study, sevoflurane was found to be as effective as an inhalation sedation agent as the standard dose of nitrous oxide used in normal inhalation sedation in the treatment of adult anxious dental patients.
Sevoflurane in low concentrations is equivalent in effect to near equipotent concentrations of nitrous oxide. This would suggest that further research, perhaps with slightly higher concentrations of sevoflurane, is needed. If sevoflurane was shown to be acceptable at slightly higher concentrations, there is scope to explore the development of equipment specifically designed to deliver sevoflurane as an inhalation sedation agent in future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25377847/

Alternatively, deep sedation and analgesia may be required.
The aim of our study was to compare the Bispectral Index (BIS) and Comfort Score (CS) with respect to their clinical significance for sedation/analgesia in children undergoing open muscle biopsy.
Thirty pediatric patients subjected to open muscle biopsy for diagnosis of their underlying disease were prospectively enrolled. Sedation/analgesia was performed in all patients using remifentanil and propofol. The patients were simultaneously monitored using the CS and BIS.
All sedations and muscle biopsies were performed uneventfully. The CS and BIS were significantly correlated (R = 0.589; P < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.918 with a maximum cut-off point of BIS 70.5 (sensitivity 0.9; specificity 0.785) for adequate sedation. Sensitivity of 100% was achieved at BIS 60. Accordingly, all patients with BIS ≤60 had CS within the target range of 10-14. The BIS showed substantial intra- and interindividual variability (30 points and 58 points, respectively) during sedation, whereas CS varied only within close ranges during sedation. In 25 patients, sedatives were reduced according to low BIS values (<60). No unintended anesthesia awareness was noted during the study period.
Bispectral Index provides an additional helpful tool to guide sedation/analgesia in minor surgical procedures in children. BIS values ≤60 correlated with sufficient depth of sedation and prevented unintended awareness. Additionally, BIS measurement allowed for distinct regulation of depth of sedation without prolonged sedation/analgesia due to unintended overdose.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25279930/

Monitoring depth of anesthesia is a fundamental solution to this problem. The induction of anesthesia alters frequency and mean of amplitudes of the electroencephalogram (EEG), and its phase couplings. We analyzed EEG changes for phase coupling between delta and alpha subbands using a new algorithm for depth of general anesthesia measurement based on complex wavelet transform (CWT) in patients anesthetized by Propofol. Entropy and histogram of modulated signals were calculated by taking bispectral index (BIS) values as reference. Entropies corresponding to different BIS intervals using Mann-Whitney U test showed that they had different continuous distributions. The results demonstrated that there is a phase coupling between 3 and 4 Hz in delta and 8-9 Hz in alpha subbands and these changes are shown better at the channel T 7 of EEG. Moreover, when BIS values increase, the entropy value of modulated signal also increases and vice versa. In addition, measuring phase coupling between delta and alpha subbands of EEG signals through continuous CWT analysis reveals the depth of anesthesia level. As a result, awareness during anesthesia can be prevented.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25276220/

The authors examined the effects of anesthesia and hypercapnia on swallowing-breathing coordination.
In a randomized controlled crossover study, general anesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane was titrated using an up-down method to identify the threshold for suppression of the motor response to electrical stimulation of the forearm. Additional measurements included bispectral index, genioglossus electromyogram, ventilation (pneumotachometer), and hypopharyngeal pressure. During wakefulness and at each level of anesthesia, carbon dioxide was added to increase the end-tidal pressure by 4 and 8 mmHg. A swallow was defined as increased genioglossus activity with deglutition apnea and an increase in hypopharyngeal pressure. Spontaneous swallows were categorized as physiological (during expiration or followed by expiration) or pathological (during inspiration or followed by an inspiration).
A total of 224 swallows were analyzed. Anesthesia increased the proportion of pathological swallows (25.9% vs. 4.9%) and decreased the number of swallows per hour (1.7±3.3 vs. 28.0±22.3) compared to wakefulness. During anesthesia, hypercapnia decreased hypopharyngeal pressure during inspiration (-14.1±3.7 vs. -8.7±2 mmHg) and increased minute ventilation, the proportion of pathological swallows (19.1% vs. 12.3%), and the number of swallows per hour (5.5±17.0. vs. 1.3±5.5).
Anesthesia impaired the coordination between swallowing and respiration. Mild hypercapnia increased the frequency of swallowing during anesthesia and the likelihood of pathological swallowing.

We hypothesized that there is a correlation between a reduction of PV and the time to eye opening after general anaesthesia. The objective was to investigate whether PV can predict eye opening after sevoflurane anaesthesia. Prospective, explorative clinical study included 20 patients, ASA physical status 1 or 2, at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden, from November 2012 to January 2013 scheduled for elective breast tumour surgery. A general anaesthesia was delivered with inhalation of oxygen, nitrous oxide and sevoflurane anaesthesia to a depth of 1.2 minimal alveolar concentration. Sevoflurane inspiratory and expiratory concentrations were measured. Bispectral index monitoring, PV as measured by pulse oximeter, heart rate and carbon dioxide were registered at before anaesthesia, 15 min after induction (at 1.2 minimal alveolar concentration), at end of surgery and at eye opening at the end of anaesthesia. PV values were lower before anaesthesia and at eye opening compared to at 15 min after induction and at end of surgery (P < 0.05). The reduction of PV between end of surgery and eye opening was 0.76. We conclude that the pulse oximeter PV could be a useful variable to assess the timing of recovery, in terms of eye opening after a general anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25273626/

Remifentanil, an ultra-short-acting opioid, has a very brief duration of action. We hypothesized that using remifentanil alone for colonoscopy would provide shorter recovery time compared with the midazolam-meperidine combination.
Time to achieve Aldrete score = 10 was determined and compared in patients who were randomly allocated to receive remifentanil alone (group-R, n = 27) or a midazolam-meperidine combination (group-MM, n = 27) for colonoscopy. Intergroup differences in sedation, recall analgesia, cardio-respiratory profiles, and satisfaction of patient and endoscopist were also determined during and after colonoscopy.
Group-R showed a significantly shorter recovery time than group-MM (median [25-75%], 0 [0-10] vs 30 [15-30] min, P < 0.001). Group-R showed significantly higher bispectral-index values during colonoscopy (92 [85-96] vs 84 [80-87], P = 0.001); a higher incidence of recall of explanations given during and after colonoscopy (100 vs 48% and 96 vs 52%, both P < 0.001); and a lower distress score (visual analog scale 30/100 vs 37/100 mm, P = 0.002), than did group-MM. Neither extent of pain, incidence of hemodynamic instability nor incidence of respiratory depression differed between the groups.
Remifentanil for colonoscopy afforded faster recovery compared to midazolam-meperidine combination.

We used order patterns cross recurrence plot and provide an index named order pattern laminarity (OPL) to assess changes in neuronal synchronization as the mechanism forming the foundation of conscious perception. The prediction probability of 0.9 and 0.84 for OPL and BIS specified that the OPL index correlated more strongly with effect-site propofol concentration. Also, our new index makes faster reaction to transients in EEG recordings based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model parameters and demonstrates less variability at the point of loss of consciousness (standard deviation of 0.04 for OPL compared with 0.09 for BIS index).

This study aimed to assess the analgesic effect of dexmedetomidine on intraoperative opioid requirements using body movement as observation indicator at similar BIS-guided sedative depth in propofol anesthesia.
Ninety patients were randomly divided into three groups to receive administration of saline, and dexmedetomidine at 0.5 and 1.0 µg kg(-1) over 10 min, followed by saline and dexmedetomidine at infusion rates of 0.17 and 0.33 µg kg(-1) h(-1), respectively. After dexmedetomidine and saline bolus administration, propofol was titrated to maintain the BIS values at 45-55. When BIS values reached the predetermined range, remifentanil was administered by target-controlled infusion. Five minutes following remifentanil treatment, skin was incised and the motor response observed. Then, the concentration of remifentanil blunting the motor response in 50% of patients (Ce50) was determined using a modified Dixon's sequential 'up-and-down' method.
Dexmedetomidine significantly decreased effect-site concentrations of propofol for maintaining the preset BIS range (P < 0.01). The Ce50 (95% CI) of remifentanil were 0.93 (0.82-1.03), 1.03 (0.89-1.17) and 0.91 (0.77-1.06) ng ml(-1) in the 0 (saline), 0.5 and 1.0 µg kg(-1) dexmedetomidine groups, respectively, indicating non-statistically significant differences among groups (P > 0.0167).
Propofol and its combination with dexmedetomidine have similar opioid requirements for preventing motor response to skin incision when titrated to similar BIS values.

This non-invasive device analyses ECG signals and determines the analgesia nociception index (ANI), allowing for quantitative assessment of the analgesia/nociception balance in anesthetized patients. Ketamine, an analgesic adjuvant with sympathomimetic properties, has been shown to improve perioperative pain management. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether low-dose ketamine, due to its intrinsic effect on the sino-atrial node, affects HRV and, therefore, interferes with ANI measurements. This pilot study included 20 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomies. Anesthesia and analgesia were maintained with sevoflurane and fentanyl respectively, in a standardized manner. Five minutes after intubation, 0.5 μg kg(-1) of intravenous (i.v.) ketamine was administered. ANI, bispectral index (BIS), heart rate and blood pressure were recorded from the induction of anesthesia until 5 min after skin incision. There was not any significant decrease in mean (±SD) ANI values after intubation (2.11±20.11, p=0.35) or i.v. ketamine administration (1.31±15.26, p=0.28). The mean (±SD) reduction in ANI values after skin incision was statistically significant (13.65±15.44, p=0.01), which is consistent with increased nociception. A single i.v. bolus of 0.5 μg kg(-1) ketamine did not influence the ANI values of 20 women under standardized general anesthesia conditions and absent noxious stimulation.

Although numerous validation studies pertaining to behavioural observation scales have been published, several limitations associated with using these measures for pain assessment remain. Over the past few years, researchers have been interested in the use of the bispectral index monitoring system as a proxy for the evaluation of encephalography readings to assess the level of anesthesia and, potentially, analgesia.
To synthesize the main studies exploring the use of the bispectral index monitoring system for pain assessment, to guide future research in adults under sedation in the intensive care unit.
The EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies published between 1996 and 2013 that evaluated the use of the bispectral index in assessing pain.
Most studies conclude that nociceptive stimulation causes a significant increase in the bispectral index and revealed the importance of controlling certain confounding variables such as the level of sedation.
Further studies are needed to clearly demonstrate the relationship between nociceptive stimuli and the bispectral index, as well as the specificity of the bispectral index in detecting pain.
Il est extrêmement difficile pour les cliniciens d’évaluer la douleur, surtout à l’unité de soins intensifs, où le patient est souvent incapable de communiquer verbalement. Plusieurs méthodes d’évaluation de la douleur ont été proposées dans ce contexte, y compris des échelles d’observation comportementale et l’évaluation de mesures physiologiques comme la fréquence cardiaque et la tension artérielle. Malgré la publication de nombreuses études de validation des échelles d’observation comportementale, plusieurs limites sont liées à leur utilisation pour évaluer la douleur. Depuis quelques années, les chercheurs s’intéressent à l’utilisation du système de monitorage de l’index bispectral pour remplacer l’évaluation des lectures encéphalographiques afin d’estimer le niveau d’anesthésie et, potentiellement, d’analgésie.

The objective of this study is to determine whether it is possible to find an appropriate, less profound, BIS level in the pediatric patient that would enable an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE) to be performed in spontaneous breathing without causing gag reflex or motor response.
A prospective study was designed and included 61 patients from 12-167 months old, and an ASAI-II who needed a diagnostic UGE. The study was conducted from October 2011 to March 2013.
UGE performed with an anesthetic protocol using propofol. The vital signs measured were heart and respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure. The sedation level score (Ramsay scale) and BIS values were also measured. The first attempt was performed at BIS level 60-69, and this was not feasible, then the anesthetic was deepened and a second attempt made at BIS level 50-59. If this was still not possible a deeper anesthetic level was then achieved and a third attempt made at BIS level 45-49. Variables of interest were: effective BIS level (eBIS), BIS level at which UGE was performed without gag reflex or motor response; propofol total dose (mgkg(-1)), induction time (time from onset of sedation to effective start of UGE). A logistic regression analysis was performed to obtain an equation to estimate the possibility of UGE success.
The distribution of the patient was: male 40%, female 60%, with 11 (18%) patients under 36 months. The statistical values are expressed as mean and standard deviation, with following results; age (months): 95.9±45.86; weight (kg): 30.5±14.68; effective BIS: 56.41±4.63; induction time (minutes): 11.07±2.69; total propofol dose (per kg): 4.86±1.21. An additional intra-procedure propofol bolus was given in 38 patients (62%), with 7/38 of them (18%) due to movement, and 31/38 (82%) due to BIS level increase. No statistical differences were found in effective BIS level between older and younger patients.
According to the results, BIS levels below 59 predict UGE success, with 72.13% sensitivity and 88.06% specificity in the pediatric population studied.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25048996/

The bispectral index (BIS) monitor is a non-invasive tool that objectively evaluates the depth of sedation. The purpose of this prospective randomized controlled trial was to evaluate whether BIS guided sedation with propofol and remifentanil could reduce the number of patients requiring rescue propofol, and thus reduce the incidence of sedation- and/or procedure-related complications.
A total of 180 patients who underwent the ESD procedure for gastric adenoma or early gastric cancer were randomized to two groups. The control group (n=90) was monitored by the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation scale and the BIS group (n=90) was monitored using BIS. The total doses of propofol and remifentanil, the need for rescue propofol, and the rates of complications were recorded.
The number of patients who needed rescue propofol during the procedure was significantly higher in the control group than the BIS group (47.8% vs. 30.0%, p=0.014). There were no significant differences in the incidence of sedation- and/or procedure-related complications.
BIS-guided propofol infusion combined with remifentanil reduced the number of patients requiring rescue propofol in ESD procedures. However, this finding did not lead to clinical benefits and thus BIS monitoring is of limited use during anesthesiologist-directed sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25048506/

Although the hormonal changes such as progesterone associated with pregnancy may affect the minimum alveolar concentration of volatile anesthetics, the relationship between the anesthetic or analgesic requirements and progesterone level in full-term women has not been studied. In this study, we attempted to identify relationships between anesthetic or analgesic requirements and maternal serum concentrations of progesterone.
We studied 100 parturients >36 weeks' gestation who were scheduled for planned cesarean delivery under general anesthesia. Venous blood was collected to measure the maternal progesterone concentration. Anesthesia was induced with 4 to 5 mg/kg thiopental and 0.8 mg/kg rocuronium. During anesthetic maintenance, sevoflurane 0.5% to 2.0% and nitrous oxide 50% in oxygen were titrated based on arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and bispectral index value. Vital signs, bispectral index, end-tidal sevoflurane concentration, and sevoflurane consumption per hour were recorded. Visual analog scale pain scores and cumulative analgesic consumption were recorded at 2, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively.
The mean serum progesterone concentration was 128.2 ± 83.0 ng/mL. There was a significant negative correlation between sevoflurane consumption per hour and serum progesterone concentration (Pearson correlation r = -0.26; 95% confidence interval, -0.44 to -0.05, P = 0.01). Cumulative analgesic consumption at postoperative hours 2 (r = -0.20, P = 0.05), 24 (r = -0.25, P = 0.02), and 48 (r = -0.28, P = 0.01) were correlated inversely with serum progesterone concentration. Women with high progesterone levels (higher than the median value) had lower sevoflurane consumption per hour (P = 0.02) and 48-hour postoperative cumulative analgesic consumption (P = 0.02) than women with low (below the median value) levels.
The decreased anesthetic and analgesic requirements of near full-term parturients might partially depend on serum progesterone concentration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25036373/

The principal objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of ANI to predict hemodynamic reactivity during suspension laryngoscopy. The secondary objectives were to investigate the performances of ANI and bispectral index (BIS) to assess sedation and of BIS to predict hemodynamic reactivity during the procedure.
Fifty patients undergoing suspension laryngoscopy with total intravenous anesthesia using propofol and remifentanil were analysed in this prospective observational study. The ANI, BIS and Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale were measured at predefined time-points during the procedure. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were built to evaluate the performance of ANI and BIS to predict hemodynamic reactivity (increase by more than 20% of heart rate and/or systolic blood pressure within 5 min) and assess sedation (OAA/S ≤ 2) during the procedure.
For the prediction of hemodynamic reactivity, better performance was observed with ANI in comparison to BIS (ROC curve AUC [95% CI] = 0.88 [0.83-0.92] vs. 0.73 [0.66-0.79], P < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of ANI ≤ 55 to predict hemodynamic reactivity within 5 min were 88% and 83%, respectively.

Secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial (Michigan Awareness Control Study).
Three hospitals at a tertiary care centre in the USA.
Unselected patients presenting for surgery under general anaesthesia.
Alerts based on end-tidal anaesthetic concentration or bispectral index values.
Using case and outcomes data from the primary study, end-tidal anaesthetic concentration and bispectral index values were analysed using Youden's index and c-statistics derived from a receiver operating characteristic curve to determine a specific alerting threshold for the prevention of awareness.
No single population-based threshold that maximises sensitivity and specificity could be identified for the prevention of intraoperative awareness, using either anaesthetic concentration or bispectral index values. The c-statistic for anaesthetic concentration was 0.431 ± 0.046, and 0.491 ± 0.056 for bispectral index values.
We could not derive a single population-based alerting threshold for the prevention of intraoperative awareness using either anaesthetic concentration or bispectral index values.

Ideally, the incorporation of brain monitoring into routine practice would promote the maintenance of an optimal depth of anaesthesia, with an ultimate goal of avoiding the negative outcomes that have been associated with inadequate or excessive anaesthesia. A variety of processed electroencephalogram devices exist, of which the bispectral index is the most widely used, particularly in the research setting. Whether such devices prove to be useful will depend not only on their ability to influence anaesthetic management but also on whether the changes they promote can actually affect clinically important outcomes.

We studied the relationships between these indices, level of hypnosis (BIS level), and antinociception (predicted remifentanil effect-site concentrations, CeREMI) before and after stimulation. Also, we measured their association with movement in response to a noxious stimulus.
We randomized 120 patients to one of 12 groups targeting different hypnotic levels (BIS 70, 50, and 30) and various CeREMI (0, 2, 4, or 6 ng/mL). At pseudo-steady state, baseline values were observed, and a series of stimuli were applied. Changes in BIS, CVI, heart rate (HR), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) between baseline and response period were analyzed in relation to level of hypnosis, antinociception, and somatic response to the stimuli.
CVI and BIS more accurately correlate with somatic response to an Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation-noxious stimulation than HR, MAP, CeREMI, and propofol effect-site concentration (Tukey post hoc tests P < 0.01). Change in CVI is more adequate to monitor response to stimulation than changes in BIS, HR, or MAP (as described by the Mathews Correlation Coefficient with significance level set at P < 0.001). In contrast, none of the candidate analgesic state indices was uniquely related to a specific opioid concentration and is extensively influenced by the hypnotic state as measured by BIS.
CVI appears to correlate with somatic responses to noxious stimuli. However, unstimulated CVI depends more on hypnotic drug effect than on opioid concentration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24892803/

A cohort was defined with >5 cumulative minutes of EEG suppression, and 1:2 propensity-matched to a non-suppressed cohort (≤5 min suppression). We evaluated the association between EEG suppression and mortality using multivariable logistic regression, and examined risk factors for EEG suppression using zero-inflated mixed effects analysis.
Ninety day postoperative mortality was 3.9% overall, 6.3% in the suppressed cohort, and 3.0% in the non-suppressed cohort {odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]=2.19 (1.48-3.26)}. After matching and multivariable adjustment, EEG suppression was not associated with mortality [OR (95% CI)=0.83 (0.55-1.25)]; however, the interaction between EEG suppression and mean arterial pressure (MAP) <55 mm Hg was [OR (95% CI)=2.96 (1.34-6.52)]. Risk factors for EEG suppression were older age, number of comorbidities, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and higher intraoperative doses of benzodiazepines, opioids, or volatile anaesthetics. EEG suppression was less likely in patients with cancer, preoperative alcohol, opioid or benzodiazepine consumption, and intraoperative nitrous oxide exposure.
Although EEG suppression was associated with increasing anaesthetic administration and comorbidities, the hypothesis that intraoperative EEG suppression is a predictor of postoperative mortality was only supported if it was coincident with low MAP.

There was also a significant difference in mean volatile anesthetic administration (minimum alveolar concentration): 0.98 vs 0.64 (mean difference -0.35 [CI95, -0.44 to -0.26], P < 0.001) and target propofol concentrations: 4.0 vs 3.1 μg/mL (mean difference -0.8 [CI95, -1.2 to -0.3], P = 0.004). Intraoperative mean arterial blood pressures were similar (85 vs 87 mm Hg; mean difference 2 [CI95, -2 to 6], P = 0.86), and there were no differences in short-term recovery characteristics or hospital length of stay. There was a significant difference in the incidence of wound infection at 30 days (13% vs 3%; risk difference -10% [CI95, -21 to -0.1], P = 0.04). At 1 year, the composite rates of complications in the low and high groups were 28% and 17% (risk difference -11 [CI95, -25 to 4], P = 0.15) and mortality rates were 12% and 9%, respectively (risk difference -2 [CI95, -14 to 9], P = 0.70).
This pilot study demonstrated that depth of anesthesia targeting with BIS or SE was achievable in a high-risk population with adequate separation of processed electroencephalogram monitor targets. The expected incidence of postoperative complications and mortality occurred.

We tested the hypothesis that patients with dementia having non-cardiac surgery have a lower ratio of bispectral index (BIS) to minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) during the five minutes immediately preceding incision, thus exhibiting deeper hypnotic levels at a given MAC fraction.
We obtained records from our database registry on patients who had volatile general anesthesia during their most recent operation. We excluded patients premedicated with midazolam. Patients with dementia were identified and their diagnosis was confirmed by chart review. Each patient with dementia was successfully matched with a maximum of five patients without dementia using a multivariate nearest-neighbor distance-matching algorithm restricted to the following criteria: American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, age, five-minute pre-incision time-weighted average (TWA) estimated effect-site concentration of propofol and fentanyl, and use of remifentanil. Our primary outcome was the TWA BIS-to-MAC ratio during the five minutes immediately preceding incision.
We analyzed 31 patients with dementia matched with 151 patients without dementia. Median [quartiles] TWA BIS-to-MAC ratios for the matched patients were 85 [73, 100] for the patients with dementia and 78 [73, 84] for the patients without dementia. The percent difference in mean BIS-to-MAC ratios between patients with dementia and patients without dementia was 9% (95% confidence interval: -9% to 29%) (P = 0.35, Wald test).

Today, electroencephalogram-based monitors promise a more specific assessment of the brain function. To date, most approaches were focused on a ""head-to-head"" comparison of either electroencephalogram- or standard parameter-based monitoring. In the current study, a multimodal indicator based on a combination of both electro encephalographic and standard anesthesia monitoring parameters is defined for quantification of ""anesthesia depth.""
Two hundred sixty-three adult patients from six European centers undergoing surgery with general anesthesia were assigned to 1 of 10 anesthetic combinations according to standards of the enrolling hospital. The anesthesia multimodal index of consciousness was developed using a data-driven approach, which maps standard monitoring and electroencephalographic parameters into an output indicator that separates different levels of anesthesia from awake to electroencephalographic burst suppression. Obtained results were compared with either a combination of standard monitoring parameters or the electroencephalogram-based bispectral index.
The anesthesia multimodal index of consciousness showed prediction probability (P(K)) of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.97) to separate different levels of anesthesia (wakefulness to burst suppression), whereas the bispectral index had significantly lower PK of 0.80 (0.76 to 0.81) at corrected threshold P value of less than 0.05. At the transition between consciousness and unconsciousness, anesthesia multimodal index of consciousness yielded a PK of 0.88 (0.85 to 0.91).

Orexin has been shown to be involved in arousal from general anesthesia. In this study, we examined plasma orexin-A levels in both elderly and young patients during the anesthesia arousal cycle.
We recruited 41 patients scheduled for elective lumbar surgery and eventually evaluated 34 patients. Patients were divided into a young group (age 30-55, N = 16) and an elderly group (age 65-77, N = 18). Anesthesia with sevoflurane-remifentanil was titrated to maintain the Bispectral Index between 45 and 65. The times from stopping anesthesia to eyes opening and extubation were recorded. Arterial blood was collected, and plasma orexin-A was determined by radioimmunoassay at the following 4 time points: preanesthesia (T0), 1 hour after anesthesia induction (T1), emergence (5 minutes after tracheal extubation) (T2), and 30 minutes after tracheal extubation (T3).
The times from stopping anesthesia to eyes opening and tracheal extubation were both significantly longer in the elderly group than in the young group (P = 0.004, P = 0.01, respectively). Basal (T0) orexin-A levels were higher in the elderly group than in the young group (T0, 26.13 ± 1.25 vs 17.9 ± 1.30 pg/mL, P < 0.0001).

The cortical activity monitoring in stroke patients is usually performed to evaluate epileptic activity through electroencephalogram. Bispectral index (BIS) monitor the cortical activity by fronto-temporal electrodes and is currently used for monitoring level of conscious on sedo-analgesia patients. Some studies have shown certain sensibility to detect cerebrovascular events during carotid revascularization. We aimed to evaluate the impact of BIS monitoring before and shortly after reperfusion on early and delayed clinical improvement on stroke patients.
Consecutive patients with acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke who received reperfusion therapies were monitored with bicortical BIS during the first 6 hours of admission. We registered initial and final BIS value on the affected and contralateral side and determined asymmetry and changes in relation to recanalization and other clinical variables as sedation and perprocedure complications. We defined major clinical improvement decrease ≥ 8 points at discharge or 5 day at admission. Infarct volume was measure on 24-hour CT scan. Modified Rankin score at 3 months was evaluated.

The interaction between general anesthetic agents and the local anesthetic agents given epidurally, spinally, intravenously or intramuscularly and the effects of BIS monitorisation on combined propofol-remifentanil anesthesia are examined in several studies. In literature, there is no research investigating the effect of lidocaine infusion on remifentanil and anesthetic dosage used in hypotensive anesthesia. The aim of this study is to examine this effect.
We studied 39, ASA I-II patients undergoing elective transsphenoidal endoscopic hypophyseal adenoma excision procedure. After preoperative examination and informed consent of the patient, monitorisation with non invasive blood pressure measurement, electrocardiography, pulse oxymeter and Bispectral Index (BIS) was performed. 0.9% NaCl infusion was started via a 20 G route. Lidocaine (1%) was given as 1.5 mg.kg(-1) hour-1 infusion after 1.5 mg.kg(-1) bolus dosage given in 10 minutes. Lidocaine infusion was started at the same time with anesthesia induction and was stopped after surgery. 0.9% NaCl was given as bolus dosage and as infusion in control group. Induction was maintained via propofol (1%) with 10 mg (1 ml) doses given in 5 seconds and it was applied in every 15 seconds until BIS < 45'. During maintenance of anesthesia desflurane-remifentanil-oxygen (50%)-air (50%) mixture was used. Desflurane was titrated by BIS measurement between 40 and 5012. Remifentanil infusion was started after propofol induction with 0.1 µg.kg(-1).min(-1) dosage and it was titrated between 0.1-0.5 µg.kg(-1).min(-1) levels. For intubation, rocuronium with 0.8 mg kg(-1) dosage was given during induction. After the surgical procedure, it was antagonised with neostigmine and atropine. For postoperative analgesia 1 g paracetamole was given IV after the surgery within 15 minutes and it was reapplied with 1 gr doses in every 6 hours. After extubation, the pain of the patients was examined at 15. minute at the recovery room with VRS (VRS; 0-no pain, 1-slight pain, 2-moderate pain, 3-severe pain). If VRS was greater than 2, 50 mg dolantine was given IM. For prevention of nausea and vomitting, 8 mg ondansetron was given IV. Perioperative total doses of remifentanil, desflurane (ml) (anesthesia machine records) and lidocaine (mg) were recorded after the surgery. Perioperative hemodynamic parameters (systolic, diastolic, mean blood pressures, heart rates) were recorded after monitorisation (basal), after intubation, after the start of the surgery and after extubation.
There were no statistically significant difference between two groups with respect to patient characteristics (age, gender, weight, length, Basal Mass Index = BMI) (p > 0.05). The duration of anesthesia and surgery were also not different statistically (p > 0.05). There were no statistically significant difference between two groups with respect to remifentanil dose (p > 0.05). There were no statistically significant difference between two groups with respect to eye opening and extubation times (p > 0.05).

Due to the strong correlation between the independent evaluators and the consistent correlation between the two methods, the results suggest that the Comfort-B scale is reproducible and useful in classifying the level of sedation in children requiring mechanical ventilation.
Comparar os escores resultantes da escala Comfort-B com o índice biespectral, em crianças de uma unidade de terapia intensiva.
Onze crianças com idades entre 1 mês e 16 anos, submetidas a ventilação mecânica e sedação, foram classificadas pelo índice biespectral e pela escala Comfort-B, simultaneamente. Foi obtido registro de seus comportamentos por filmagem digital; posteriormente tal registro foi avaliado por três observadores independentes e foram aplicados testes de concordância (Bland-Altman e Kappa). Foi testada a correlação entre os dois métodos (correlação de Pearson).
Foram realizadas 35 observações em 11 pacientes. A concordância entre os avaliadores, segundo o coeficiente de Kappa, variou de 0,56 a 0,75 (p<0,001). Houve associação positiva e regular entre índice biespectral e Comfort-B, com r=0,424 (p=0,011) até r=0,498 (p=0,002).
Devido à alta concordância entre os avaliadores independentes e a correlação regular entre os dois métodos, conclui-se que a escala Comfort-B é reprodutível e útil na classificação do nível de sedação de crianças em ventilação mecânica.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24553512/

In this single-center substudy of the BAG-RECALL trial (NCT00682825), we screened patients after cardiac or thoracic surgery in the ICU twice daily for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium in patients who had been randomized to intraoperative Bispectral Index (BIS)-guided and end-tidal anesthetic concentration-guided depth of anesthesia protocols. As a secondary analysis, a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection strategy was used to rank a field of candidate risk factors for delirium, followed by binary logistic regression.
Of 310 patients assessed, 28 of 149 (18.8%) in the BIS group and 45 of 161 (28.0%) in the end-tidal anesthetic concentration group developed postoperative delirium in the ICU (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval, 0.35-1.02, P= 0.058). Low average volatile anesthetic dose, intraoperative transfusion, ASA physical status, and European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation were identified as independent predictors of delirium.
A larger randomized study should determine whether brain monitoring with BIS or an alternative method decreases delirium after cardiac or thoracic surgery. The association between low anesthetic concentration and delirium is a surprising finding and could reflect that patients with poor health are both more sensitive to the effects of volatile anesthetic drugs and are also more likely to develop postoperative delirium. Investigation of candidate methods to prevent delirium should be prioritized in view of the established association between postoperative delirium and adverse patient outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24413548/
24413547,A prospective evaluation of the incidence of adverse events in nurse-administered moderate sedation guided by sedation scores or Bispectral Index.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2014,"Yang KS, Habib AS, Lu M, Branch MS, Muir H, Manberg P, Sigl JC, Gan TJ","Moderate sedation is routinely performed in patients undergoing minor therapeutic and diagnostic procedures outside the operating room. The level of sedation is often monitored by sedation nurses using clinical criteria, such as sedation scores. The Bispectral Index (BIS) is derived from changes in the electroencephalograph profile that may provide an objective measure of the level of sedation. In this prospective observational study, we investigated whether using BIS values to guide sedative drug administration influences the level of sedation and the incidence of adverse events compared with using Ramsay sedation scale (RSS) only in nurse-administered moderate sedation. We hypothesized that both depth of sedation and the incidence of adverse events related to oversedation would decrease when sedation nurses used BIS values to help guide sedative drug administration.
Sedation care was provided by trained sedation nurses under the supervision of a physician performing the procedure. The sedation regimen was initiated with IV midazolam 1 to 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg or hydromorphone 0.2 mg. Additional small boluses of midazolam, fentanyl, or hydromorphone were administered to maintain an RSS of 2 to 3 (cooperative, oriented, and responding to verbal command). Propofol was not used. Information including patient demographics, type of procedure, medication administered, RSS, and rates of adverse events was recorded by the sedation nurses for each patient on a computer-readable form. The study was divided into 3 phases. In phase 1 (baseline, 6 months' duration), baseline data on sedation practice were prospectively collected. There was no change from standard of care for all patients except that each patient had a BIS sensor attached, but the monitor was covered and nurses were blinded to the BIS values. In phase 2 (training, 3 months), the sedation nurses received comprehensive education on the use of BIS to guide sedative drug administration, pharmacology of commonly used drugs, and methods for rescue from oversedation. The recommended BIS range for moderate sedation was 75 to 90. Adequate training of all sedation nurses on the use of BIS was documented. In phase 3 (implementation, 6 months), the BIS values were used to guide drug administration.
Data were available on 1766 patients (999 and 767 patients in phases 1 and 3, respectively). Most of the procedures were colonoscopies, upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, examinations under anesthesia, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and central venous access catheter placements. No differences in the demographics between the 2 groups were observed. The RSS was inversely associated with the BIS value, r = -0.16 (95% confidence interval, -0.19 to -0.12; P < 0.00001). An RSS of 2 to 3 was maintained in 94% of patients in phase 1 and 96% of patients in phase 3 The mean (±SD) BIS values were 80.9 ± 6.8 in phase 1 and 80.4 ± 6.5 in phase 3. The number of sedation-related adverse events was lower in our sample when BIS was used, with an odds ratio of 0.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.62; P < 0.0001), and patients with restlessness had a lower BIS value than those without this symptom (P < 0.0001). No serious adverse events or deaths were reported.
Nurse-administered moderate sedation using midazolam and fentanyl was usually associated with appropriate levels of sedation as assessed by both the RSS and BIS with an overall low incidence of adverse events. The use of BIS did not change the mean level of sedation significantly, although the number of sedation-related adverse events appears to be lower when BIS was used.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24413547/

In particular, variation of R-R peak interval (RRI) of electrocardiography appears regularly oscillatory in deeper levels of anaesthesia and less regular in lighter levels of anaesthesia. We proposed a new index, non-rhythmic-to-rhythmic ratio (NRR), to quantify this feature and investigated its potential to estimate depth of anaesthesia.
Thirty-one female patients were enrolled in this prospective study. The oscillatory pattern transition of RRI was visualised by the time-varying power spectrum and quantified by NRR. The prediction of anaesthetic events, including skin incision, first reaction of motor movement during emergence period, loss of consciousness (LOC) and return of consciousness (ROC) by NRR were evaluated by serial prediction probability (PK ) analysis; the ability to predict the decrease of effect-site sevoflurane concentration was also evaluated. The results were compared with Bispectral Index (BIS).
NRR well-predicted first reaction (PK  > 0.90) 30 s ahead, earlier than BIS and significantly better than HRV indices. NRR well-correlated with sevoflurane concentration, although its correlation was inferior to BIS, while HRV indices had no such correlation. BIS indicated LOC and ROC best.
Our findings suggest that NRR provides complementary information to BIS regarding the differential effects of anaesthetics on the brain, especially the subcortical motor activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24410106/

In this prospective, randomized double-blind study, patients diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression were included for ECT. Prior to treatment, 1 µg/kg remifentanil was intravenously administered to all patients, followed by anaesthetic induction with either 0.5 mg/kg propofol or 8% sevoflurane. Following muscular paralysis with succinylcholine and hypnosis, bitemporal ECT was applied. Vital signs, depth of sedation, recovery parameters, motor and electroencephalography (EEG) convulsion activity and postictal suppression index scores were recorded.
A total of 120 sessions of ECT were administered to 12 patients. Heart rate was higher in the sevoflurane group than the propofol group. Compared with the sevoflurane group, bispectral index level was lower in the propofol group during the induction period and higher during the recovery period. Anaesthetic induction and recovery times were lower, and average motor and EEG convulsion activity was longer, in the propofol group than in the sevoflurane group.
Propofol/remifentanil is more successful compared with sevoflurane/remifentanil in anaesthesia management during ECT since it provides quick induction and recovery, longer seizure activity and stable haemodynamics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24398757/

Ninety patients were randomized to receive either intermittent midazolam boluses (1-2 mg) with 3.6-7.2 µg/kg/h of remifentanil (MR group) or dexmedetomidine 0.2-0.7 µg/kg/h after a loading dose of 1 µg/kg with 1.2-2.4 µg/kg/h of remifentanil (DR group). The sedation level assessed by the Ramsay sedation and bispectral index scores, haemodynamic variables, pain score (10-point numerical scale), and satisfaction levels of the patients and cardiologists (5-point numerical scale) were recorded. The Ramsay sedation score was significantly higher, and the bispectral index score was lower in the DR group (P< 0.001) compared with the MR group starting 10 min after drug administration. The incidence of desaturation (SpO2 < 90%) was significantly greater in the MR group compared with the DR group (15 vs. 1, P < 0.001).

Its safety and utility are promising, but still needs to be improved to reach the level of excellence expected of gold standard tests used in clinical practice. Our study compares the results of clinical and diagnostic evaluation with those of sleep endoscopy, evaluating the correlation between clinical indexes of routine clinical diagnosis and sites of obstruction in terms of number of sites involved, entity of obstruction and pattern of closure. This study consists in a longitudinal prospective evaluation of 138 patients who successfully underwent sleep endoscopy at our institution. Patients were induced to sleep with a low dose of midazolam followed by titration with propofol. Sedation level was monitored using bispectral index monitoring. Our results suggest that the multilevel complete collapse was statistically significantly associated with higher apnoea hypopnea index values. By including partial sites of obstruction greater than 50%, our results also suggest that multilevel collapse remains statistically and significantly associated with higher apnoea hypopnoea index values. Analyzing BMI distribution based on number of sites with complete and partial obstruction there was no significant difference. Finally, analyzing Epworth Sleepiness Score distribution based on number of sites with complete obstruction, there was a statistically significant difference between patients with 3-4 sites of obstruction compared to those with two sites or uni-level obstruction. In conclusion, our data suggest that DISE is safe, easy to perform, valid and reliable, as previously reported. Furthermore, we found a good correlation between DISE findings and clinical characteristics such as AHI and EPS. Consequently, adequate assessment by DISE of all sites of obstruction is very important, not only in patients with low-moderate AHI and EPS, but also in patients with a high AHI or/and high EPS, in particular to plan multilevel surgery that in these latter situations is more demanding since success may be harder to achieve.
Attualmente, la sleep endoscopy indotta per via farmacologica (DISE) è ampiamente eseguita e la validità ed affidabilità di tale metodica sono state dimostrate in numerosi studi. La sua sicurezza e utilità sono promettenti, tuttavia, tale esame necessita di essere migliorato per raggiungere il livello di eccellenza tipico di un test gold standard utilizzato nella pratica clinica. Obiettivo del nostro studio è stato paragonare i risultati della valutazione clinica e diagnostica tradizionale con quelli della sleep endoscopy, mettendo a confronto i parametri clinici con i siti di ostruzione, ed in particolare prendendo in considerazione il numero di siti implicati, il livello di ostruzione e il pattern di chiusura. In questo studio abbiamo effettuato una valutazione prospettica longitudinale di 138 pazienti che sono stati sottoposti a sleep endoscopy con induzione farmacologica del sonno presso la nostra clinica. Ai pazienti è stato indotto il sonno mediante un basso dosaggio di propofol seguito da una somministrazione di boli progressivi. La profondità della sedazione è stata monitorata mediante il monitoraggio BIS. Sulla base dei risultati ottenuti è stato possibile stabilire che l'ostruzione completa multilivello si associa in modo statisticamente significativo ad un indice più elevato di apnea/ipopnea (AHI). Includendo nell'analisi anche i siti di ostruzione parziale con chiusura > del 50% abbiamo potuto dimostrare che l'associazione fra il collasso multilivello ed un valore di indice apnea/ipopnea più elevato rimane statisticamente significativa. Per quanto riguarda il BMI invece non sono state riscontrate correlazioni significative con il numero di siti di ostruzione completi o parziali. Infine, analizzando la scala della sonnolenza di Epworth e correlandola con il numero di siti con ostruzione completa abbiamo trovato una differenza statisticamente significativa tra i paziente con 3-4 siti di ostruzione rispetto ai pazienti con 2 o 1 livello di ostruzione. In conclusione, i nostri dati suggeriscono che la sleep endoscopy indotta per via farmacologica (DISE) costituisce una procedura sicura, di facile esecuzione, valida ed affidabile, come già descritto in altri studi. Inoltre abbiamo dimostrato una buona correlazione e coerenza tra i risultati della sleep endoscopy e gli indici di AHI e di Epworth. Concludendo riteniamo che un'adeguata valutazione dei siti di ostruzione mediante sleep endoscopy sia molto importante non solo nei pazienti con AHI ed indice di Epworth lieve/moderato, ma anche in quelli con AHI e/o indice di Epworth elevati, soprattutto nella pianificazione di una chirurgia multilivello che in questi casi è più impegnativa con un indice di successo più difficile da raggiungere.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24376297/

These subjects had lower bispectral index (p < 0.001) and sedative requirements (p < 0.001) during hypothermia compared with the 57 subjects discharged with good outcome. Early prediction of neurologic recovery was best 7 hours after ICU admission, and median bispectral index scores at that time were 31 points lower in subjects discharged with poor outcome (11 [interquartile range, 4-29] vs 42 [37-49], p < 0.001). Median sedation requirements decreased by 17% (interquartile range, -50 to 0%) 7 hours after ICU admission in subjects with poor outcome but increased by 50% (interquartile range, 0-142%) in subjects with good outcome (p < 0.001).

The model incorrectly reclassified 1% of subjects from poor to good outcome but did not incorrectly reclassify any from good to poor outcome.
Bispectral index scores and sedative requirements early in the course of therapeutic hypothermia improve the identification of patients who will not recover from brain anoxia.

No differences in baseline characteristics were observed between the groups. In the DEX group, dexmedetomidine was loaded (0.3 μg/kg) before superficial anesthesia for eye surgery. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), bispectral index (BIS) monitoring, and end-tidal CO2 were recorded before infusion (baseline) and every 5 minutes after loading of the study drugs.

For the given input signal excitation, the results show an over-parameterization of the standard pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models. The same identifiability assessment was performed on recently proposed minimally parameterized parsimonious models for both the neuromuscular blockade and the depth of hypnosis. The results show that the majority of the model parameters are identifiable from the available input-output data.

This prospective, randomized, and controlled investigation was designed to evaluate whether the difference in intranasal DEX dosing would produce different beneficial effects on the attenuation of cardiovascular and arousal responses during anesthesia induction and intubation.
Forty children, aged from 3 to 6 years, of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II and scheduled for elective adenotonsillectomy randomly received intranasal DEX 1 μg·kg(-1) (group D1) or 2 μg·kg(-1) (group D2) 30 min before anesthesia induction. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in oxygen flow. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) as measurements of cardiovascular response and bispectral index (BIS) as an index of arousal response were recorded every 5 min after intranasal DEX administration and measured every 1 min for 5 min after intubation. Sedation status, behavior scores, and mask induction scores were also assessed.
Mean arterial pressure did not show statistical differences during the anesthesia induction, but did demonstrate significantly milder responses to laryngoscopy and intubation in group D2 compared with group D1. Change in HR was consistent with MAP during laryngoscopy and intubation. Patients who received 2 μg·kg(-1) DEX presented with deeper sedation and less anxiety by the assessments of the alertness scale, behavior score, and BIS scores. Group D2 dosing achieved more favorable scores in children undergoing mask induction.
Intranasal DEX 2 μg·kg(-1) administered 30 min before anesthesia induction provides considerable effect to attenuate the increase in MAP caused by intubation response. Changes in HR and BIS also demonstrate that this kind of premedication provides effective attenuation of intubation response. And preoperative intranasal DEX 2 μg·kg(-1) produces optimal-sedation, more favorable anesthesia induction course in pediatric patients. Premedication of intranasal DEX is a considerable way to blunt cardiovascular and arousal responses to endotracheal intubation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24224515/

Seventy-eight healthy volunteers were recruited in this open-label, single-bolus, dose-escalation, phase I trial and were allocated into 16 cohorts. Each volunteer received a single bolus injection of EI. The dose started with 0.3 mg/kg (for isoflurane) and was planned to end with 64.6 mg/kg. Postdose vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests, chest radiograph, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and development of any adverse event were closely monitored as safety measurements. Effectiveness in producing sedation/anesthesia was assessed by Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation and Bispectral Index.
The dose escalation ended as planned. The most common adverse events associated with EI were injection pain (77 of 78, 98.7%) and transient tachycardia (22 of 78, 25.6%). Only at high doses (≥38.3 mg/kg) did EI cause transient hypotension (5 of 78, 6.4%) or apnea (11 of 78, 14.1%), but all the affected volunteers recovered uneventfully. Fast onset of unconsciousness (typically 40 s after injection) was developed in all volunteers receiving doses of 22.6 mg/kg or greater. Waking-up time and depression in Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation correlated well with EI dose. None of the postdose tests revealed any abnormal result.

Thirty patients who underwent tonsillectomy under general anesthesia (GA) were included. Patients were assigned randomly to one of two groups: group 1 (n = 15) received propofol, group 2 (n = 15) sevoflurane as anesthetic agent. The sedation level was assessed by the bispectral index system. DPOAE measurements were performed before premedication (T 1), 5 min after premedication (T 2), 3 min after induction of general anesthesia (T 3) and every 10 min (T 4, T 5) thereafter until the end of surgery at about 23 min post-anesthetic induction, while sedation levels were obtained starting at the beginning until the end of anesthesia. After premedication, both blood oxygen saturation and heart rate decreased. Following induction of anesthesia systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased, while, as expected, the level of sedation increased. Analyzing the propofol and sevoflurane group separately, both groups showed comparable overall courses of DPOAE levels at higher frequencies (2.8 kHz p = 0.310, 4 kHz p = 0.193, 6 kHz p = 0.269, 8 kHz p = 0.223) and no changes of DPOAE levels compared with baseline values were observed. At T5 the 1 kHz DPOAE level increased in the propofol group and slightly decreased in the sevoflurane group (p < 0.001). While the 1.4 kHz DPOAE level in the propofol group did not change over time the 1.4 kHz DPOAE level decreased in the sevoflurane group (baseline to T 4 p = 0.045; Baseline to T 5 p = 0.004). While overall there were different courses between these two groups in the 2 kHz DPOAE level, in the post hoc analysis only a tendency in the change from baseline to T 4 could be observed (p = 0.082). These results indicate that while the amplitudes of certain DPOAEs were influenced by GA, the depth of anesthesia had no effect on this measure of cochlear function in clinical routine. Therefore, DPOAE measurements in sedation and during GA are useful but the effect of anesthetic agents on DPOAE levels needs to be taken into account when analyzing the test.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24150547/
24122077,Entropy correlates with Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2014,"Sharma A, Singh PM, Trikha A, Rewari V, Chandralekha","Sedation is routinely used in intensive care units. However due to absence of objective scoring systems like Bispectral Index and entropy our ability to regulate the degree of sedation is limited. This deficiency is further highlighted by the fact that agitation scores used in intensive care units (ICU) have no role in paralyzed patients. The present study compares entropy as a sedation scoring modality with Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients in an ICU. Twenty-seven, mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients of either sex, 16-65 years of age, were studied over a period of 24 h. They received a standard sedation regimen consisting of a bolus dose of propofol 0.5 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 lg/kg followed by infusions of propofol and fentanyl ranging from 1.5 to 5 mg/kg/h and 0.5 to 2.0 lg/kg/h, respectively. Clinically relevant values of RASS for optimal ICU sedation (between 0 and -3) in non-paralyzed patients were compared to corresponding entropy values, to find if any significant correlation exists between the two. These entropy measurements were obtained using the Datex-Ohmeda-M-EntropyTM module. This module is presently not approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for monitoring sedation in ICU. A total of 527 readings were obtained. There was a statistically significant correlation between the state entropy (SE) and RASS [Spearman's rho/rs = 0.334, p\0.0001]; response entropy (RE) and RASS [Spearman's rho/rs = 0.341, p\0.0001]). For adequate sedation as judged by a RASS value of 0 to -3, the mean SE was 57.86 ± 16.50 and RE was 67.75 ± 15.65. The present study illustrates that entropy correlates with RASS (between scores 0 and -3) when assessing the level of sedation in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24122077/

In this study, the authors assessed whether patients with a history of AWR (1) are actually at higher risk for AWR; (2) receive different anesthetic management; and (3) are relatively resistant to the hypnotic actions of volatile anesthetics.
Patients with a history of AWR and matched controls from three randomized clinical trials investigating prevention of AWR were compared for relative risk of AWR. Anesthetic management was compared with the use of the Hotelling's T statistic. A linear mixed model, including previously identified covariates, assessed the effects of a history of AWR on the relationship between end-tidal anesthetic concentration and bispectral index.
The incidence of AWR was 1.7% (4 of 241) in patients with a history of AWR and 0.3% (4 of 1,205) in control patients (relative risk = 5.0; 95% CI, 1.3-19.9). Anesthetic management did not differ between cohorts, but there was a significant effect of a history of AWR on the end-tidal anesthetic concentration versus bispectral index relationship.
Surgical patients with a history of AWR are five times more likely to experience AWR than similar patients without a history of AWR. Further consideration should be given to modifying perioperative care and postoperative evaluation of patients with a history of AWR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24113645/

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,2013,"Kim TH, Yoon YG, Uhm J, Jeong DW, Yoon SZ, Park SH","In this paper, a cepstral analysis based approach to measuring the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is presented. Cepstral analysis is a signal processing technique widely used especially for speech recognition in order to extract speech information regardless of vocal cord characteristics. The resulting index for the DoA is called index based on cepstral analysis (ICep). The Fisher criterion is engaged to evaluate the performance of indices. All analyses are based on a single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) of 10 human subjects. To validate the proposed technique, ICep is compared with bispectral index (BIS), which is the most commonly used method to estimate the level of consciousness via EEG during general anesthesia. The results show that ICep has high correlation with BIS, and is outstanding in terms of the Fisher criterion and offers faster tracking than BIS in the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24111105/

The monitors of depth of anesthesia, based on the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), have been progressively introduced into the daily practice to provide additional information about the state of the patient. However, the quantification of analgesia still remains an open problem. The purpose of this work is to analyze the capability of prediction of nociceptive responses based on the time-frequency representation (TFR) of EEG signal. Functions of spectral entropy, instantaneous power and instantaneous frequency were calculated in order to predict the presence or absence of the nociceptive responses to different stimuli during sedation in endoscopy procedure.

The intensive care unit (ICU) sedation strategy is to use the least amount of medication to meet safety and comfort goals. Titration of pharmacological agents is currently guided by clinical assessment tools. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the addition of a neurophysiological monitor, bispectral index (BIS), aided the ICU nurse in reducing the amount of drug used, compared to a clinical tool alone, in a general critical care population.
In this prospective clinical trial, mechanically ventilated adults (N=300) were randomised to sedation assessment using only the observational assessment tool (RASS) or a combination of observational and physiologic measures (RASS+BIS). Subjects were enrolled from a medical ICU (N=154), a trauma ICU (N=72) and a general mixed-use ICU (N=74).
BIS-augmented sedation was only associated with the reduction of drug use when patients were sedated with propofol or narcotic agents (propofol [1.61 mg/kg/h vs. 1.77 mg/kg/h; p<0.0001], fentanyl [54.73 mcg/h vs. 66.81 mcg/h; p<0.0001], and hydromorphone [0.97 mg/h vs. 4.00 mg/h: p<0.0001] compared to RASS alone. In contrast, patients sedated with dexmedetomidine or benzodiazepines were given higher doses under the BIS-augmented dexmedetomidine [0.46 mcg/kg/h vs. 0.33 mcg/kg/h; p<0.0001], lorazepam [4.13 mg/h vs. 3.29 mg/h p<0.0001], and midazolam [3.73 mg/h vs 2.86 mg/h; p<0.0001]) protocol compared to clinical assessment alone.
The clinical evaluation of depth of sedation remains the most reliable method for the titration of pharmacological sedation in the critical care unit. However, BIS-augmented assessment is helpful in reducing the amount of propofol and narcotic medication used and may be considered an adjunct when these agents are utilised.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24103486/

Each patient received two successive propofol doses during induction (0.5 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) with a time interval allowing the return of Bispectral Index (BIS) to awake values.
Primary outcomes were HRV parameters, which included normalized power spectral density at low frequency (LFnorm) and high frequency (HFnorm) bands and the ratio LF/HF. Secondary outcomes were BIS values, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature.
The interaction of age and propofol dose level was significant [multivariate analysis of variance, F (3,74) = 4.72, P = 0.005], representing a combined effect of age and propofol dose level on the mean HRV parameters. Propofol induction decreased the HFnorm component and enhanced LFnorm and LF/HF in the younger group, but had no significant effect in the older group. Such an effect was not associated with a significant difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) decrements between the younger and older groups. Within each group, propofol caused significant decreases in SBP compared with preinduction values. Heart rate did not change significantly during propofol administration between groups or within groups.
Propofol and aging act in synergy to depress the activity of the cardiovascular component of the autonomic nervous system. However, a compensatory increase in sympathetic outflow was seen in young patients. Such counterbalance was not observed in the older group.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24095889/

General anesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol, and intubation was performed after succinylcholine 1 mg·kg(-1). Propofol was administered via a target-controlled infusion (TCI) system (Diprifusor™) set at an effect-site concentration of 5 μg·mL(-1). Fentanyl was given by a TCI system using the STANPUMP software (Schafer model). The concentration for the first patient was set at 3 ng·mL(-1) and modified in each group according to the up-down method. Skin incision was performed after more than ten minutes equilibration time. Serum fentanyl concentration, bispectral index (BIS), and hemodynamic parameters were measured two minutes before and after skin incision. The Cp50incision of fentanyl was derived from the mean of the crossovers (i.e., the serum fentanyl concentrations of successive participants who responded and those who did not or vice versa).
Ten and 11 independent crossover pairs were collected in the control and flurbiprofen groups, respectively, representing 42 of 62 enrolled patients. The mean (SD) fentanyl Cp50incision was less in the flurbiprofen group [0.84 (0.63) ng·mL(-1)] than in the control group [1.65 (1.15) ng·mL(-1)]; P = 0.007; however, there were no differences in BIS, blood pressure, or heart rate, between groups.

Sixteen patients undergoing elective first-time coronary artery bypass surgery.
Patients were randomized to receive total intravenous anesthesia with fospropofol (n = 8) or propofol (n = 8) combined with alfentanil as total intravenous anesthesia. Bispectral index, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded continuously, and pulmonary artery catheter measurements were obtained. Plasma concentrations of formate, phosphate, and Ca(2+) were monitored closely. Safety and tolerability were assessed by adverse events, neurologic examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs.
The total doses of fospropofol and propofol during anesthesia were 11.3±2.5 and 4.4±1.0 mg/kg/h, respectively. According to the achieved bispectral index (BIS) values, fospropofol was as effective as propofol in providing general anesthesia and sedation. There were no clinical signs of formate toxicity in the fospropofol group. The only treatment-related adverse event after administration of fospropofol was a transient burning sensation in the perineal and perianal region during induction of sedation or anesthesia.

Three different propofol 1% formulations-Diprivan (Astra-Zeneca, Cheshire, United Kingdom), Propoven (Fresenius-Kabi AG, Bad Homburg, Germany), and Lipuro (B-Braun, Melshungen AG, Germany)-were compared with either placebo (saline solution) or lidocaine 1% mixed to the propofol solution. Depth of anesthesia was automatically guided by bispectral index and by a computerized closed-loop system for induction, thus avoiding dosing bias. The authors recorded the total dose of propofol and duration of induction and the patient's discomfort through a behavioral scale (facial expression, verbal response, and arm withdrawal) ranging from 0 to 6. The authors further evaluated postoperative recall of pain using a Visual Analog Scale.
Of the 227 patients enrolled, 217 were available for analysis. Demographic characteristics were similar in each group. Propoven required a higher dose for induction (2.2 ± 0.1 mg/kg) than Diprivan (1.8 ± 0.1 mg/kg) or Lipuro (1.7 ± 0.1 mg/kg; P = 0.02).

We used propofol to induce sleep, monitoring the value of bispectral index to evaluate the depth of sedation. For each patient, we recorded obstruction sites,obstruction patterns and the effects of the mandibular pull-up manoeuvre on both obstruction and snoring. We ascertained that, in almost all patients, the noise of snoring was generated at the oropharyngeal level. The obstruction at the oropharyngeal level, either in isolation or in combination with other structures, is far more common. The mandibular pull-up manoeuvre was effective in reducing or resolving the obstruction in a large number of patients, even though their AHI values were high. For those patients having an AHI over 15, we point out the various therapeutic indications gained from the sleep endoscopy examinations. Drug-induced (propofol) sleep endoscopy can be considered be a safe procedure, easily practicable, valid and reliable; we therefore consider it a fundamental clinical investigation that can be essential when choosing treatment.

Clinical anaesthesiology,2013,"Ellerkmann RK, Soehle M, Kreuer S","To easily measure the depth of anaesthesia during routine surgical procedures has always been a goal in anaesthesiology. For decades, scientists have been developing indices to describe and evaluate the depth of anaesthesia. Historically, mean alveolar gas concentration (MAC) values for volatile anaesthetics have been used to target a predefined level of anaesthesia. MAC values were however not established to differentiate between the hypnotic and analgesic components of anaesthesia. Indices were therefore developed that measure the effect of hypnotics predominantly on the brain (in contrast to an effect on the spinal cord) with the vision to be able to measure the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness. Although monitors measuring the depth of anaesthesia are still not capable of measuring the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness, brain monitoring has proved to help clinicians control the depth of anaesthesia. Clinical trials have shown that the use of brain-monitoring devices can lead to a reduction of intraoperative drug consumption, reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, facilitate recovery from anaesthesia compared to routine care and can also lead to a reduction of intraoperative awareness. However a study demonstrating both a reduced intraoperative drug consumption and at the same time a reduction of intraoperative awareness due to the use of brain-monitoring devices has not been published yet.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24012234/

We measured electrical activity of the diaphragm to assess neural drive and calculated its integral over time during 1 minute (∫electrical activity of the diaphragm/min) to estimate diaphragm energy expenditure (effort), arterial blood gases, airway pressure, tidal volume and its coefficient of variation, respiratory rate, neural timing components, and calculated the ineffective triggering index. Increasing the depth of sedation did not cause significant modifications of respiratory timing, while determined a progressive significant decrease in neural drive (with both modes) and effort (in pressure support ventilation only). In pressure support ventilation, the difference in ineffective triggering index between wakefulness and light sedation was negligible (from 5.9% to 7.6%, p = 0.97); with deep sedation, however, ineffective triggering index increased up to 21.8% (p < 0.0001, compared to both wakefulness and light sedation). With neurally adjusted ventilatory assist, ineffective triggering index fell to 0%, regardless of the depth of sedation. With both modes, deep sedation caused a significant increase in PaCO2, which resulted, however, from different breathing patterns and patient-ventilator interactions.
In pressure support ventilation, deep propofol sedation increased asynchronies, while light sedation did not. Propofol reduced the respiratory drive, while breathing timing was not significantly affected. Gas exchange and breathing pattern were also influenced by propofol infusion to an extent that varied with the depth of sedation and the mode of ventilation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23982026/

In the study, we included 91 patients with acute circulatory failure (70 ± 15 y) who received propofol (n = 45 patients, PROP group) or dexmedetomidine (n = 46 patients, DEX group). An initial passive leg-raising (PLR 1) test was performed in all patients to evaluate preload dependency at baseline. Propofol and dexmedetomidine were infused and titrated according to the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale; the results ranged from -2 to -1, and the bispectral index values ranged from 60-75. A second PLR test (PLR 2) was performed before administration of a 250-mL normal saline fluid challenge over a 5-min period. We obtained central venous pressure and cardiac index (CI) measurements before and after the two PLR tests and volume expansion. An increase of ≥10% in CI during PLR was considered to be a positive test finding that was indicative of preload dependency, whereas an increase of <10% in CI during PLR was considered to be a negative test finding.
At baseline, 22 of 45 patients had negative PLR 1 in the PROP group, whereas 20 of 46 patients had negative PLR 1 in the DEX group.

Prospective, single center, observational study.
Twenty-nine patients with upper airway collapse were twice evaluated using DISE according to the depth of sedation, as confirmed by the bispectral index (BIS), which is a measure of the level of consciousness. Changes in the site and degree of obstruction according to the change in sedation depth at the retropalatal and the retroglossal levels were evaluated. The possible contributing factors of this change were explored.
As DISE sedation deepened, the upper airway became narrower in 37% of patients at the retropalatal level and in 44.8% of patients at the retroglossal level. No clinical, polysomnographic, or cephalometric variables showed any association with the change in the degree of retroglossal airway narrowing, with the exception of mouth breathing during DISE.
The degree of upper airway narrowing can be aggravated according to the sedation depth. The monitoring of sedation depth during DISE is critical, especially in patients with mouth breathing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23918761/

The effect of BIS on recovery from anaesthesia and consumption of anaesthetics in a paediatric population receiving total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil has not been studied.
A single-blind, single-centre clinical trial. One hundred fifty-seven patients were enrolled. They were scheduled for ear, nose, and throat surgery and stratified according to age groups (1-3 years, 4-11 years, 12-17 years, 18-65 years) and type of operation, yielding a total of nine subgroups. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either a TIVA with propofol and remifentanil according to conventional clinical practice (control) or guided by BIS. Normalised propofol (μg/kg/min) and remifentanil (μg/kg/min) consumption and time to extubation (s) were the outcome measures.
Children aged 1-3 years in the BIS group had a longer time to extubation compared with controls (P: 0.04). Patients aged 12-17 years in the BIS group received higher maintenance infusion rates of propofol compared with controls (P = 0.02). No significant difference for the outcome variables was evidenced in the other age groups.
BIS monitoring for guidance of propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia does not result in reduced consumption of anaesthetics and does not reduce time to extubation in adult and children compared with conventional practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23855759/

Changes in pulse pressure induced by the passive leg raising test (PLR-ΔPP) as marker of fluid responsiveness, assessed prior to sedation, may predict hemodynamic changes. The present study was to investigate the power of the PLR test in critically ill patients in predicting hypotension induced by the induction of dexmedetomidine sedation.
Fluid responsiveness was estimated by a passive leg raising (PLR) test before dexmedetomidine sedation. Patients were assigned to either the ""Nonresponders"" or ""Responders"" group according to their hemodynamic responses to the PLR test (""Nonresponders"", PLR-ΔPP < 10.3%; ""Responders"", PLR-ΔPP ≥ 10.3%). Sedation was performed with a dexmedetomidine infusion (0.5 µg/kg over a 10-minute loading period, then 0.2 - 0.7 µg×kg(-1)×h(-1)) and titrated to maintain the target Richmond agitation sedation scale (RASS) score in the range of -2 to -1 and the bispectral index value in the range of 60 to 75. Radial artery pulse pressure, heart rate (HR), and central venous pressure (CVP) were measured at each phase of the study procedure. Hemodynamic fluctuations during the use of dexmedetomidine sedation were recorded and compared between the two groups.
Fifty patients had a median (25% - 75% interquartile range) of 71 (61 - 78) years old were studied. At baseline, 39 of the 50 patients were ""Nonresponders"" and 11 were ""Responders"". Following dexmedetomidine sedation, patients classified as ""Responders"" had a significantly greater systolic blood pressure decrease during the induction of dexmedetomidine sedation than the ""Nonresponders"" ((-26.3 ± 6.8)% vs. -11.8 ± 8.5)%, P < 0.001). In addition, the ""Responders"" group required significantly more fluid boluses (8 vs. 3; P < 0.001) and vasopressors (2 vs. 0; P < 0.05) than the ""Nonresponders"" group to restore blood pressure. Finally, PLR-ΔPP was positively correlated with changes in systolic blood pressure (PLR-ΔSBP) (r(2) = 0.576; P < 0.001) and significantly correlated with dexmedetomidine infusion-induced changes in SBP (r(2) = 0.202; P < 0.05). AUC for PLR-ΔPP was 0.84 (95%CI 0.71 - 0.93). PLR-ΔPP predicted hypotension with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 92%.
The fluid responsiveness assessment pre-sedation was found to predict blood pressure fluctuation during the induction of dexmedetomidine sedation. The PLR test conducted prior to sedation may be a useful tool to identify patients with a high risk of hemodynamic events and may be used to indicate the need for prophylactic treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23823816/

After obtaining approval of the research ethics committee and informed consent, 200 patients were evaluated and referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Patients were randomized to receive propofol-fentanyl or midazolam-fentanyl (n = 100/group). We assessed the level of sedation using the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score and bispectral index (BIS). We evaluated patient and physician satisfaction, as well as the recovery time and complication rates. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software and included the Mann-Whitney test, χ² test, measurement of analysis of variance, and the κ statistic.
The times to induction of sedation, recovery, and discharge were shorter in the propofol-fentanyl group than the midazolam-fentanyl group. According to the OAA/S score, deep sedation events occurred in 25% of the propofol-fentanyl group and 11% of the midazolam-fentanyl group (P = 0.014). Additionally, deep sedation events occurred in 19% of the propofol-fentanyl group and 7% of the midazolam-fentanyl group according to the BIS scale (P = 0.039).

After IRB approval and written consent, patients scheduled for surgical removal of STT were randomized to receive PR or SS. Anesthesia was adjusted to maintain BIS values between 45 and 55. The primary outcome was the time from discontinuation of anesthetics to extubation. Secondary endpoints were: time to respond to a simple order, and to achieve spontaneous ventilation, agitation score at emergence, postoperative Mini Mental State, postoperative Aldrete score, pain Visual Analogical Score, simplified sedation score, Glasgow Coma Scale, and surgical complications.

Bispectral index was used as the control variable for hypnosis, the analgoscore for analgesia, and phonomyography for neuromuscular blockade. McSleepy can be used to control the induction, maintenance and emergence from general anesthesia. To do so, a large touch screen is used to provide a user friendly interface, permitting bidirectional communication: the user giving information about the different stages of anesthesia, and the system prompting the anesthesiologist to perform certain actions such as mask ventilation, intubation or waking-up the patient using audio clips with voice commands. Several safety features were implemented to provide a secure and reliable anesthesia. Preliminary results of 15 patients are presented in this paper. Evaluation of McSleepy was done through an assessment of its clinical performance and using Varvel's performance indices.

The aim of our study was to determine whether anesthesia provided by a university-degreed nurse anesthesia provider during an endoscopic procedure is comparable in terms of safety and efficacy with routine sedation practice. This randomized, double-blind study included 100 adult patients who underwent colonoscopy conducted in the Evgenidion University Hospital during a single year. Subjects were divided into 2 groups: the first group received the usual scheme of intravenous sedation with midazolam and fentanyl administered by a member of the endoscopic team that was blind to Bispectral Index (BIS) values recordings (Group 0). The second group received intravenous bolus injection of propofol bolus by a university-degreed anesthesia registered nurse based on the BIS values (Group 1). The average of the mean BIS values of Group 0 was 85.07 (SD = 8.01) and for Group 1 was 76.1 (SD = 10.88; p = .04).

Detection and monitoring can be limited by contextual level of consciousness (LOC) alterations, cognition, expression, or language deficits. Recent data suggest that existing pain assessment tools may not be applicable to all neurocritically ill patients, especially in those with LOC alterations and atypical pain-associated behaviors. Targeted sedation goals may be neurologically disease specific; for instance, intracranial pressure (ICP) targets will supersede sedation titration by other criteria. Technology such as bispectral index (BIS) may be beneficial in avoiding excessive medication administration in deeply sedated neurologically injured ICU patients. Given the wide variety of pathology in the neurocritically ill patients, it is unclear if delirium can be diagnosed and unequivocally differentiated from symptoms of the underlying neurological pathology. However, delirium symptoms may herald life-threatening primary insult progression or result from a new secondary neurological injury and should be monitored. Patients with neurological injury or illness are often excluded from ICU studies addressing pain, sedation, and delirium, but this need not be the case. We review what is understood in this area based on current evidence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23716314/

We hypothesised that the bispectral index of the EEG (BIS) could be a helpful tool in evaluating the depth of sedation in this difficult environment. The main objective of the present study was to assess the agreement of BIS with the clinical scales in the out-of-hospital setting.
This prospective study included mechanically ventilated patients. BIS values were blindly recorded continuously. A Ramsay score was performed every 5 min. The main judgement criterion was the correlation between BIS values and the Ramsay score.
72 patients were included, mostly presenting with toxic coma (36%) or neurological coma (21%). The median (IQR) BIS value was 85 (84-86) when the Ramsay score was 3, 80 (76-84) when the Ramsay score was 4, 61 (55-80) when the Ramsay score was 5 and 45 (38-60) when the Ramsay score was 6. According to Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, BIS was categorised into three classes (BIS<54 corresponding to Ramsay score 6, 54≤BIS<72 for Ramsay score 5 and BIS≥73 for Ramsay score ≤4). Based on these categories, the proportion of appropriate BIS values was 67% (217/323). The concordance correlation coefficient for repeated measurements was 0.54 (0.43-0.64). The agreement between BIS and the Ramsay score is moderate.

In this setting, we hypothesized that Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring might be helpful in shortening the patient's awakening and in predicting recovery of consciousness in order to initiate reliable intraoperative brain mapping.
An observational prospective study was performed on 27 consecutive asleep-awake craniotomies, in which BIS was monitored and BIS data collected offline. Nine critical intraoperative time points were defined and analyzed [preinduction, start of surgery, termination of hypnotic drug, eye opening, obeying simple commands, laryngeal mask airway (LMA) removal, initiation of brain mapping, initiation of closure, and end of surgery].
A shorter time to LMA removal was associated with a higher BIS at the termination of the hypnotic drug (P=0.016, Mann-Whitney U test). From the initiation of surgery to the time of LMA removal, BIS was significantly lower than the preinduction values, whereas at the initiation of brain mapping, BIS returned to the preinduction values (Friedman test P<0.0001, Dunns multiple comparisons test). Compared with LMA removal, BIS values >85 predicted the initiation of brain mapping with a sensitivity of 44% (95% confidence interval, 25.5%-64.7%) and a specificity of 74% (95% confidence interval, 53.7%-89%).
During asleep-awake craniotomies, higher BIS values at the end of the asleep phase are associated with shorter time to LMA removal, suggesting that BIS monitoring may be beneficial in shortening recovery from anesthesia.

Grip strength decreased from a median (IQR [range]) of 483 (443-517 [380-586]) N to 358 (280-405 [108-580]) N (p < 0.001) during sedation and recovered following flumazenil administration, while bite force increased from 818 (593-1026 [405-1406]) N to 1377 (1243-1585 [836-2357]) N (p < 0.001) during sedation. Although bite force gradually returned to baseline following flumazenil administration, it remained increased throughout the experimental period. We conclude that bite force increased during intravenous sedation and that this may have clinical implications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23521655/

This study evaluated the effects of adjunctive dexmedetomidine on the accuracy of BIS to predict loss of consciousness (LOC) and BIS values predicting LOC during propofol administration.
In this randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial, 225 patients scheduled for general anaesthesia were assigned to one of three groups. Dexmedetomidine 0.5 and 1.0 µg kg-1 were intravenously infused for 15 minutes in the dexmedetomidine 0.5 and 1.0 µg kg-1 groups, and saline was infused in the control group. Propofol was administered as an effect-site target-controlled infusion after completion of dexmedetomidine infusion. Patients in each group were allocated to five subgroups in which the concentration of propofol was set at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 μg ml-1, respectively. Three minutes after propofol administration, the BIS values and Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scores were recorded.
There were no significant differences in the prediction probability of BIS for detecting LOC in the three groups. At the time of LOC, BIS50 values were 71.1 and 71.4 in the dexmedetomidine 0.5 and 1.0 µg kg-1 groups, respectively, which were significantly larger than the BIS50 of 63.2 in the control group.
The ability of BIS to predict LOC is not influenced by dexmedetomidine during propofol administration, but BIS values are enhanced at the time of LOC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23519436/

Dexmedetomidine may be beneficial in these children owing to its sedative, anxiolytic, and opioid-sparing properties with minimal respiratory depression.
Thirty-six children with spinal dysraphism at lumbosacral area, aged 8 to 12 years, undergoing corrective surgery were randomized to receive either dexmedetomidine or volume-matched saline (placebo) after positioned prone until beginning of skin closure. Inspired concentration of sevoflurane was changed to keep the bispectral index score between 45 and 55. Perioperative hemodynamics, intraoperative fentanyl and sevoflurane consumption, and postoperative recovery profile and fentanyl consumption was observed by blinded observers. Postoperative pain, emergence agitation (EA), and discharge readiness from postanesthesia care unit was evaluated using the modified objective pain score, agitation Cole score, and modified Aldrete score, respectively. Fentanyl 0.5-1 µg/kg was administered for pain (objective pain score ≥4) or severe EA (agitation Cole score ≥4) lasting for >5 minutes.
The 2 groups did not differ significantly with respect to demographics, duration of anesthesia, emergence, and extubation times. The intraoperative consumption of sevoflurane and fentanyl was significantly less in dexmedetomidine group (0.2±0.1 vs. 0.3±0.1 mL/min, P<0.0001 and 2.3±0.5 vs. 3.1±0.6 μg/kg, P=0.0001, respectively), along with a lower mean heart rate (P<0.001). The mean systolic blood pressure (P=0.98) and incidence of bradycardia and hypotension was comparable in between the 2 groups. Postoperatively, the children in dexmedetomidine group had significantly lower pain scores (P<0.0001), agitation scores (P<0.0001), and time to achieve full modified Aldrete score [0 (0 to 10) vs. 10 (0 to 20) min, P=0.001]. The postoperative consumption of fentanyl was significantly less in dexmedetomidine group [0 (0 to 1.04) vs. 0.88 (0 to 3) µg/kg, P=0.003], along with a longer time of first analgesic requirement [600 (5 to 2100) vs. 5 (5 to 185) min, P=0.0001]. The mean heart rate and systolic blood pressure were higher in placebo group (P<0.001), whereas no difference was observed in respiratory rate (P=0.73) and arterial oxygen saturation (P=0.36). The number of patients with postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly lower in dexmedetomidine group [2 (11.1%) vs. 9 (50%), P=0.03].

One hundred forty-seven patients scheduled for dental implant surgeries under intravenous sedation were enrolled in this study. Heart rate, blood pressure, percutaneous oxygen saturation, and bispectral index were monitored. Sedation was induced intravenously by a bolus administration of midazolam and maintained by a continuous administration of propofol. Sedation level was adjusted to achieve scores of 3 to 4 on the Ramsay Sedation Scale. Surgical procedures were divided into 11 stages. Implant sites were labeled as right maxillary molar, maxillary anterior, left maxillary molar, right mandibular molar, mandibular anterior, and left mandibular molar sites. When coughing occurred, heart rate, blood pressure, percutaneous oxygen saturation, bispectral index, procedure being performed, and surgical site being stimulated were recorded.
One hundred seventy-two cough episodes were observed in 97 patients (66%). Cough episodes occurred during all stages of surgery but were substantially more frequent during preparation of the implant site. The incidence of cough episodes was significantly higher at the maxillary anterior site and lowest at the right mandibular molar areas.
These findings suggest that difficulties in swallowing and in the suction of intraoral fluids have variable effects at different surgical sites. Careful suction of intraoral water and an appropriate sedation level are required, especially in procedures in the maxillary anterior region.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23507323/

Bispectral index (BIS) was used as a surrogate measure of effect.
A total of 207 patients were screened for A118G and randomly received different combinations of propofol and remifentanil, changed depending on the nausea response to endoscopy tube introduction. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling was used to establish the relation between propofol and remifentanil with respect to BIS and to investigate the influence of A118G or noxious stimulation. The value of k e0 for propofol and remifentanil was estimated to avoid the hysteresis between predicted effect site concentration (Ce) and BIS.
Data from 176 patients were analysed. Eleven were recessive homozygous for A118G (OPRM = 1). A total of 165 patients were either dominant homozygous or heterozygous and considered normal (OPRM = 0). The estimated values of k e0 for propofol and remifentanil were 0.122 and 0.148 min(-1). Propofol and remifentanil were synergistic with respect to the BIS (α = 1.85). EC50 estimate for propofol was 3.86 µg/ml and for remifentanil 19.6 ng/ml in normal patients and 326 ng/ml in OPRM = 1 patients. BIS increases around 4% for the same effect site concentrations with noxious stimulation.
Predicted effect site concentration of remifentanil ranging 1-5 ng/ml synergistically potentiates the effects of propofol on the BIS but has no effect in A118G patients. Noxious stimulation increases BIS values by 4% at the same concentrations of propofol and remifentanil.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23503369/

The alternate regimen was used during the second session. Local anaesthesia was injected 30 min after placebo/sedative administration. Pain from local anaesthesia infiltration was rated on a scale from zero (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Sedation status was measured every 10 min by a blinded observer with a modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale and the bispectral index (BIS). Adverse reactions and analgesic consumption were recorded. Sedation values in group D were significantly different from placebo at 20-30 min, peaked at 40-50 min, and returned to placebo levels at 70-80 min after intranasal drug administration. Group D displayed decreased heart rate and systolic blood pressure, but the decreases did not exceed 20% of the baseline values.

Anesthesiologists commonly utilize processed electroencephalograms (EEG) in order to monitor ""depth"" of anesthesia, the most common of which is the Bispectral Index (BIS). The B-aware and B-Unaware trials, which were designed to test the efficacy of the BIS monitor, noted an auditory component in 16 of 17 confirmed cases of intraoperative awareness. Implicit auditory memory formation has been documented under general anesthesia. Small studies have documented a significant effect of noise on BIS scores during monitored anesthesia care.
Twenty-two patients undergoing general anesthesia received earplugs after the induction of anesthesia. Every ten minutes the earplugs were reinserted or removed. Noise levels were recorded every 0.125 s and both average and maximal BIS scores were recorded every minute. Non-parametric analysis of both populations (with and without earplugs) was performed. A mixed effects model with one degree of freedom (with and without earplugs) was generated to take into account the effect of anesthetic agents on BIS scores.
3009 min of data were recorded. The median and range (25-75%) BIS scores were 39 (29-46) and 39 (28-44) with and without earplugs in place, respectively. Earplugs were associated with lower BIS scores (p=0.0183). The mixed effects model confirmed this relationship (p<0.001). Subgroup analysis of BIS scores in which the potential for awareness existed (maximum BIS>60 in any one minute epoch) showed a 32% reduction in the incidence of maximal BIS scores exceeding 60 (p=0.0012). There was no relationship between ambient noise level and average maximal BIS score (R(2)=0.003).
Our study suggests that earplugs may reduce the incidence of BIS scores >60 in patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia and that auditory stimuli may affect EEG interpretation. Because of the low cost and safety of noise reduction, as well as the catastrophic implications of intraoperative awareness, further studies to explore the effects of auditory stimuli on awareness and anesthesia are warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23419669/

Anesthesia was induced via intravenous target controlled infusion of propofol (plasma concentration, 4.0 μg/mL) followed by administration of the three drugs. Heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output were continuously monitored using Flo Trac/Vigileo system™ and Bispectral index from before anesthetic induction until 10 min after tracheal intubation.
In patients without hypertension, there was a significant difference in mean arterial pressure (MAP) among the three groups 2 min after intubation. Cardiac index (CI) in all three groups decreased before intubation compared with that in the awake period, returning to awake values after intubation in all three groups.

Patients received an infusion of either propofol or dexmedetomidine for six hours and then a crossover for the subsequent six hours after sufficient washout/in. Clinical and physiological measurements were recorded hourly. In eight patients, (four traumatic injury, three subarachnoid haemorrhage and one intracerebral haemorrhage), the mean dose of propofol used was 25.5 µg/kg/minute while the mean dose of dexmedetomidine was 0.54 µg/kg/hour.

Movement of the patient or hemodynamic variations are usually considered as symptoms of insufficient analgesia. The measure of skin conductance (SC) allows an assessment of peripheral sympathetic activity. The analgesia-nociception index (ANI) provides an evaluation of the parasympathetic activity based on heart rate variability. These two non-invasive monitors might allow a better assessment of perioperative nociception.
Describe the profiles of SC and ANI after a standardized nociceptive stimulation, in anesthetized children, at different infusion rates of remifentanil.
For this pilot study, 12 children (8.4 ± 5 years) scheduled for middle-ear surgery were anesthetized with desflurane to maintain a bispectral index at 50. Remifentanil was used for analgesia, at an initial infusion rate of 0.2 μg·kg(-1) ·min(-1) . Remifentanil infusion rate was then decreased: Five steady-state periods of 10 min were obtained at 0.2, 0.16, 0.12, 0.08, and 0.04 μg·kg(-1) ·min(-1) . At the end of each period, a standardized tetanic stimulation was applied to the patient. Variations in heart rate, blood pressure, SC, and ANI were recorded before and after each stimulation.
After the stimulation, ANI was significantly decreased compared with prestimulation values for all remifentanil infusion rates. This decrease was greater at 0.04 μg·kg(-1) ·min(-1) than at the other infusion rates. SC, heart rate, and blood pressure were not modified by the stimulations, whatever the dose of remifentanil.
ANI might provide a more sensitive assessment of nociception in anesthetized children than hemodynamic parameters or skin conductance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23170802/

We wanted to examine these methods during noxious stimulation during general anaesthesia and if the responses were associated with variability in genes related to pain.
Sixty patients, given propofol to a BIS level of 40-50, were stimulated with standardised tetanic electrical stimuli during propofol infusion, plasma level of 3 μg/ml alone, or together with remifentanil target plasma level of 3 ng/ml or 10 ng/ml. The CSS, SC, BIS index and the variability of the BIS index were registered. The inter-individual variation in nociceptive responses was analysed for co-variation with genotypes of 89 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 23 candidate genes.
During tetanic stimuli, CSS and SC increased significantly and were attenuated with increasing level of remifentanil, different from the BIS index and the variation in the BIS index. Polymorphisms in the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), tachykinin 1 receptor (TACR1), dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3) and beta arrestin 2 (ARRB2) genes were associated with the co-variation in SC variables or CSS response or both during standardised nociceptive stimuli (P < 0.05). Because of no corrections for multiple testing, the genetic analyses are explorative, and associations must be tested in further studies.
This exploratory study suggests genes that may be tested further with relation to nociceptive response during anaesthesia. SC and CSS may be useful tools for monitoring nociceptive response during general anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23167532/

We investigated the influence of atropine on the bispectral index (BIS) response to endotracheal intubation during anesthetic induction with propofol and remifentanil target controlled infusion (TCI). Fifty-six patients aged 18-50 years undergoing general anesthesia, were enrolled. For induction of anesthesia, propofol TCI was set at a target effect-site concentration of 4.0 μg/ml. Two minutes later, remifentanil was started at an effect-site concentration of 4.0 ng/ml. Four minutes after the start of propofol TCI, patients received either atropine (10 μg/kg) or an equal volume of normal saline. Tracheal intubation was performed 10 min after anesthetic induction. Mean arterial pressure, HR, SpO2, and BIS were recorded during the 15 min-anesthesia induction. From 2 to 5 min after tracheal intubation, BIS was significantly higher in the atropine group than in the control group (p = 0.043, 0.033, 0.049, and 0.001, respectively). When compared with baseline values (immediately before intubation), BIS showed a significant increase at 1 min after intubation in both groups, without intergroup differences, whereas it decreased significantly from 4 to 5 min after intubation only in the control group. This study demonstrated that atropine maintained BIS increases in response to endotracheal intubation during anesthetic induction with propofol and remifentanil TCI, although the maximal response did not differ between the groups.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23108496/

We evaluated bispectral index (BIS) monitoring as a tool to identify adult patients that awakened during therapeutic hypothermia.
Review of prospectively collected registry data, with retrospective chart review of patient descriptions during hypothermia. Data are presented as median (interquartile range).
7 of 309 patients (2.2%) treated with TH over 6 years awoke (followed commands) prior to completing hypothermia. Median age was 58 (54-66) years; 71% were male, cardiac arrest was witnessed in 6 (86%) and out-of-hospital in 6 (86%), and 4 patients (57%) were transferred from another hospital. 5 patients (71%) had an initial rhythm of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, time to return of spontaneous circulation was 17 (12-23)min.

This study was designed to compare the efficacy (sedation, anxiolysis, analgesia, operating conditions, and patients' satisfaction) and safety of midazolam and dexmedetomidine as sedatives for dental procedures in a randomised, double-blind study in third molar and dental implant surgery. Sixty healthy patients who were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) group I or II were enrolled and we recorded their personal details, the amount of drug used, their degree of satisfaction, duration of operation, and haemodynamic and respiratory variables. The two groups were comparable. The amount of local anaesthetic (p=0.11) and the duration of operation did not differ significantly (p=0.32). The patients in the dexmedetomidine group had a slower heart rate, lower systolic and diastolic pressure, and cooperated better. There were no significant differences in their respiratory rates, bispectral index, and total volume of drugs used.

Our goals were to evaluate the association between LESP and 2 measures of sedation: bispectral index (BIS) and the responsiveness component of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness score (OAA/S).
Eleven healthy volunteers were each sedated on 2 separate days. Subjects were given sedative infusions of increasing target plasma concentrations of dexmedetomidine or propofol. LESP and GEPG were recorded after starting each infusion phase. Generalized estimating equation modeling was used to assess the relationship between LESP and, respectively, BIS and OAA/S. The existence of a drug-dependent association was evaluated within these models by testing an interaction term. Wald tests were used to evaluate the relationships within the models.
We found a significant relationship between LESP and BIS (P=0.0043) after adjusting for the main effect of sedative type--a deepening of sedation as measured by a decrease in BIS of 10% was associated with a decrease [Bonferroni-adjusted 95% CI] in LESP of -1.34 [-2.39, -0.29] mmHg. After adjusting for the main effect of sedative drug, LESP significantly declined with declining OAA/S (P=0.001); a unit decrease of OAA/S was associated with a decrease [Bonferroni-adjusted 95% CI] in LESP of -2.01 [-3.20, -0.81] mmHg.

Efficacy trials based on the Bispectral Index® (BIS) monitor (Covidien, Boulder, CO) and anesthetic concentrations have focused on high-risk patients, but there are no effectiveness data applicable to an unselected surgical population.
We conducted a randomized controlled trial of unselected surgical patients at three hospitals of a tertiary academic medical center. Surgical cases were randomized to alerting algorithms based on either BIS values or anesthetic concentrations. The primary outcome was the incidence of definite intraoperative awareness; prespecified secondary outcomes included postanesthetic recovery variables.
The study was terminated because of futility. At interim analysis the incidence of definite awareness was 0.12% (11/9,376) (95% CI: 0.07-0.21%) in the anesthetic concentration group and 0.08% (8/9,460) (95% CI: 0.04-0.16%) in the BIS group (P = 0.48). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of meeting criteria for recovery room discharge or incidence of nausea and vomiting.

22950534,Sedation for critically ill or injured adults in the intensive care unit: a shifting paradigm.,Drugs,2012,"Roberts DJ, Haroon B, Hall RI","As most critically ill or injured patients will require some degree of sedation, the goal of this paper was to comprehensively review the literature associated with use of sedative agents in the intensive care unit (ICU). The first and selected latter portions of this article present a narrative overview of the shifting paradigm in ICU sedation practices, indications for uninterrupted or prolonged ICU sedation, and the pharmacology of sedative agents. In the second portion, we conducted a structured, although not entirely systematic, review of the available evidence associated with use of alternative sedative agents in critically ill or injured adults. Data sources for this review were derived by searching OVID MEDLINE and PubMed from their first available date until May 2012 for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses and economic evaluations. Advances in the technology of mechanical ventilation have permitted clinicians to limit the use of sedation among the critically ill through daily sedative interruptions or other means. These practices have been reported to result in improved mortality, a decreased length of ICU and hospital stay and a lower risk of drug-associated delirium. However, in some cases, prolonged or uninterrupted sedation may still be indicated, such as when patients develop intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury. The pharmacokinetics of sedative agents have clinical importance and may be altered by critical illness or injury, co-morbid conditions and/or drug-drug interactions. Although use of validated sedation scales to monitor depth of sedation is likely to reduce adverse events, they have no utility for patients receiving neuromuscular receptor blocking agents. Depth of sedation monitoring devices such as the Bispectral Index (BIS©) also have limitations. Among existing RCTs, no sedative agent has been reported to improve the risk of mortality among the critically ill or injured. Moreover, although propofol may be associated with a shorter time to tracheal extubation and recovery from sedation than midazolam, the risk of hypertriglyceridaemia and hypotension is higher with propofol. Despite dexmedetomidine being linked with a lower risk of drug-associated delirium than alternative sedative agents, this drug increases risk of bradycardia and hypotension. Among adults with severe traumatic brain injury, there are insufficient data to suggest that any single sedative agent decreases the risk of subsequent poor neurological outcomes or mortality. The lack of examination of confounders, including the type of healthcare system in which the investigation was conducted, is a major limitation of existing pharmacoeconomic analyses, which likely limits generalizability of their results.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22950534/
22931975,Response surface analysis of sevoflurane-remifentanil interactions on consciousness during anesthesia.,Chinese medical journal,2012,"Wang HL, Yang L, Guo XY, Zhang LP, Bi SS, Lu W","Recently, the combination of sevoflurane and remifentanil has been widely used in general anesthesia. In this study, we investigated the sevoflurane-remifentanil pharmacodynamic interactions at clinical concentrations using the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) and the bispectral index (BIS) by response surface analysis.
Totally 65 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I patients age 20 to 50 years old were included in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to be anesthetized with different target end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations that ranged from 0.2% to 3.4% in increments of 0.2%. The end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was maintained constant throughout the study. Remifentanil was infused with a target controlled infusion (TCI) system at increasing step-wise concentrations from 1 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml. The values of OAA/S and BIS at different sevoflurane-remifentanil concentration combinations were measured. The pharmacodynamic interactions between sevoflurane and remifentanil were analyzed by a response surface method. The three-dimensional response surfaces were constructed with Minitab Software. Model parameters were estimated with NONMEM program.
Sevoflurane and remifentanil acted synergistically on OAA/S. Sevoflurane alone could produce OAA/S ≤ 1 at a minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of 0.93%. When used in combination with remifentanil at 1, 3, 6, and 10 ng/ml, the corresponding sevoflurane MACs were reduced to 0.79%, 0.58%, 0.48%, and 0.38%, with reductions of 17.2%, 37.6%, 48.4%, and 62.0% from baseline, respectively. In patients administered remifentanil alone, the OAA/S score was ≥ 3 even when the remifentanil concentration reached 10 ng/ml. BIS was closely associated with the sevoflurane concentration and the remifentanil concentration did not noticeably influence the relationship between the sevoflurane concentration and BIS. A sevoflurane concentration of (1.04 ± 0.19)% to (1.81 ± 0.21)% could maintain a BIS between 60 and 40.
The response surface method can analyze the pharmacodynamic interactions between remifentanil and sevoflurane qualitatively and quantitatively. Within the range of our study (remifentanil ≤ 10 ng/ml, sevoflurane ≤ 3.4%), the two drugs produced synergistic effects on OAA/S but had no interactive effect on BIS. A guideline of BIS between 40 and 60 may cause excessive anesthesia when opioids are used to maintain anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22931975/

We evaluated patients' safety and ease of use of PCS for gynaecological outpatient procedures.
In a prospective double-blind study, 165 patients were randomized to use propofol or propofol with alfentanil as PCS combined with local anaesthetic for pain control. Data on cardiopulmonary function, consciousness, and need for interventions were collected at baseline and every fifth minute. The surgeons' evaluation of the ease and the duration of the procedure were recorded.
One hundred and fifty-five patients used PCS for the entire procedure, 76 patients propofol, and 79 patients propofol/alfentanil. Fifteen procedures in the propofol group were limited or could not be done, compared with four in the propofol/alfentanil group (P = 0.02). The duration of surgery was not affected. The addition of alfentanil affected respiratory function compared with the propofol group: five patients compared with none were manually ventilated (P = 0.03), and two thirds, compared with a quarter, were given supplementary oxygen as their saturation decreased below 90% (P < 0.001). Overall cardiovascular stability was maintained. The propofol group had deeper conscious sedation as measured by the bispectral index (P = 0.03), but all patients could be roused. In the propofol/alfentanil group, five patients became apnoeic and could not be roused.
PCS using propofol alone supports patients' safety, as the addition of alfentanil increased the need for specific interventions to maintain respiratory stability. However, alfentanil increases the feasibility of the procedure, as complementary doses of propofol were not required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22897508/

We examined the effects of a maintained low dose of remifentanil infusion on cardiovascular responses and coughing during extubation in postoperative intensive care unit patients sedated with propofol-remifentanil. Fifty patients who required mechanical ventilation after major abdominal surgery were randomised into remifentanil group (n=25) or control group (n=25). Sedation during mechanical ventilation was maintained with remifentanil and propofol via a target-controlled infusion system. These drugs were titrated to the target sedation range, bispectral index values of 60 to 75 and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale values of -3 to -2.

Extubation was performed if the patient's respiratory, haemodynamic states were stable and if the patient was able to follow commands. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and cough severity were evaluated. The mean arterial pressure, heart rate and cough severity did not differ between the two groups during extubation. The time from stopping of propofol infusion to extubation was significantly longer in the remifentanil group compared to that in the control group (P=0.020).

The objectives of this study are to compare emergence time and postoperative sedation intensity assessed by the bispectral index (BIS) and the Ramsay sedation scale in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization (MR) with or without ECC.
Ten patients undergoing MR with ECC (ECC group) and 10 with no ECC (no-ECC group) were administered with sufentanyl, propofol 2.0 μg.mL(-1) and pancuronium target controlled infusion. After surgery, propofol infusion was reduced to 1 μg.mL(-1) and suspended when extubation was indicated. Patients BIS, Ramsay scale and time to wake up were assessed.
The ECC group showed lower BIS values beginning at 60 minutes after surgery (no-ECC = 66±13 and ECC = 53±14, p=0.01) until 120 minutes after infusion (no-ECC = 85±8 and ECC = 73±12, p=0.02). Sedation level measured by the Ramsay scale was higher in the ECC group at 30 minutes after the end of the surgery (no-ECC = 5±1 and ECC = 6±0, p=0.021), at the end of infusion (no-ECC = 5±1 and ECC = 6±1, p=0.012) and 5 minutes after the end of infusion (no-ECC = 4±1 and ECC = 5±0.42, p=0.039).

However, the treatment time tends to be relatively long and insufflation and manipulation of the endoscope can increase pain and discomfort. We aimed to find an optimal method for sedation during ESD.
Patients scheduled to undergo ESD for early gastric cancer or adenoma were randomly assigned to sedation with midazolam or propofol, and consciousness level was evaluated by bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. Primary end points of effectiveness (three parameters) and secondary end points of safety during ESD and after return to the ward were compared between the groups. Study registration was in the UMIN Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN 000001497), and the institutional trial number was KDOG 0801.
From June 2008 through June 2009, we enrolled 178 patients (90 midazolam, 88 propofol). Regarding safety after ESD, recovery was significantly better in the propofol group immediately after and at 1 hour and 2 hours after return to the ward (P < 0.001). The number of patients who required a continuous supply of oxygen 2 hours after returning to the ward was significantly lower in the propofol group (midazolam 18; propofol 6; P = 0.010). Though propofol seemed to be better for effectiveness and safety, there were no statistically significant differences for all three primary end points and the safety parameters (hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia).

However there are no randomized studies available, comparing various anesthetic techniques as regards their effects on ECoG.
The following is a double blind, randomized cross over study to compare the effects of isoflurane and propofol with or without nitrous oxide on electrocorticographic activity in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. 40 patients suffering from medically intractable epilepsy scheduled to undergo resective surgery under ECoG guidance under general anesthesia, (March 2008-December 2010) were enrolled. Patients received either isoflurane or propofol (with air/oxygen or nitrous oxide/oxygen) as maintenance agents as per randomization and ECoG was recorded and quantified as per a scoring system (range 1-5, where 5 is most abnormal).
The mean ECoG score in isoflurane group and propofol with nitrous oxide was 3.0(1.2), 3.2(1.2) [p=0.7] and with air was 3.9(1.0) and 3.4(1.1) [p=0.1] respectively. In both isoflurane group and propofol group addition of nitrous oxide depressed the ECoG score (p ≤ 0.01, 0.5 respectively). The total duration of anesthesia, surgery, emergence time, extubation time, and hospital stay was comparable in two groups.

To demonstrate the limited value of topical pharyngeal anesthesia in patients under moderate to deep sedation with propofol.
One hundred and twenty-nine patients undergoing gastroscopy were prospectively randomized to receive 10 % lidocaine or distilled water topical spray as an adjunct to intravenous propofol via target-controlled infusion. Verbal and somatic responsiveness, presence of gag reflex and hiccup to esophageal intubation, and the overall ease of the procedure were evaluated by the anaesthetists and gastroenterologists. Hemodynamic parameters including peripheral oxygen saturation, systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), heart rate (HR), bispectral index, and SBP × HR were compared at 5 time points: on arrival, after 5 spontaneous breaths, when estimated brain concentration of propofol, Ce, reached 3.5 μg/ml, on esophageal intubation, and on awakening.
No statistical difference was observed between the lidocaine and distilled water group in verbal or somatic responses, gag reflex or hiccups on esophageal intubation. Similarly, BIS, SBP, DBP, and HR showed no significant difference between the groups.

The normal response to high minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) fraction of anesthetics is hypotension and low Bispectral Index (BIS) scores. Low MAP and/or BIS at lower MAC fractions may represent anesthetic sensitivity. The authors sought to characterize the effect of the triple low state (low MAP and low BIS during a low MAC fraction) on duration of hospitalization and 30-day all-cause mortality.
Mean intraoperative MAP, BIS, and MAC were determined for 24,120 noncardiac surgery patients at the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio. The hazard ratios associated with combinations of MAP, BIS, and MAC values greater or less than a reference value were determined. The authors also evaluated the association between cumulative triple low minutes, and excess length-of-stay and 30-day mortality.
Means (±SD) defining the reference, low, and high states were 87 ± 5 mmHg (MAP), 46 ± 4 (BIS), and 0.56 ± 0.11 (MAC). Triple lows were associated with prolonged length of stay (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7). Thirty-day mortality was doubled in double low combinations and quadrupled in the triple low group. Triple low duration ≥60 min quadrupled 30-day mortality compared with ≤15 min. Excess length of stay increased progressively from ≤15 min to ≥60 min of triple low.
The occurrence of low MAP during low MAC fraction was a strong and highly significant predictor for mortality. When these occurrences were combined with low BIS, mortality risk was even greater. The values defining the triple low state were well within the range that many anesthesiologists tolerate routinely.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22546967/

CVI is a single measure of the combined variability in BIS and EMG. We investigated whether increases in these variables are associated with intraoperative somatic responses.
This multicenter study included 120 patients undergoing elective, noncardiac surgery from 4 different sites. General anesthesia was maintained using propofol and remifentanil at 2 of the sites and sevoflurane and remifentanil at the 2 other sites. Propofol or sevoflurane was adjusted to maintain BIS between 45 and 60. Clinicians were blinded to CVI (v2.0) at all times, and remifentanil infusions were adjusted at the discretion of the clinician. The times of all intraoperative somatic events, defined as movement, grimacing, or eye opening, were recorded. Offline, the maintenance phase of each case was divided into consecutive, nonoverlapping, 10-minute segments. Segments were identified as containing a somatic event or containing no events. For each segment, mean sBIS, sEMG, and CVI and the heart rate (HR) range and mean arterial blood pressure range were calculated. To quantify how effectively each variable discriminated between somatic event segments and nonevent segments, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each variable. Finally, we observed the time course of sBIS, sEMG, CVI, and the HR range before each somatic event and characterized the earliest time before the somatic event at which each variable was able to discriminate between the somatic events and a specified set of nonevents.
The analysis included 33 somatic event segments and 829 nonevent segments from 105 surgical cases. The areas under the ROC curve (±SE) for sBIS, sEMG, and CVI were 0.83 ± 0.04, 0.92 ± 0.02, and 0.89 ± 0.03, respectively. The areas under the ROC curve for HR range and mean arterial blood pressure range were 0.77 ± 0.03 and 0.68 ± 0.05, respectively. CVI, sBIS, and sEMG all demonstrated higher average values before upcoming somatic events when compared with nonevents. HR range only showed a difference within a few seconds before the somatic event.
sBIS, sEMG, and CVI, measures of electroencephalogram and EMG variability, increased when intraoperative somatic events occurred. sBIS, sEMG, and CVI discriminated between 10-minute segments that contained a somatic event and those segments that did not contain an event better than changes in HR and mean arterial blood pressure. Furthermore, CVI increases before somatic events began earlier than HR changes and may provide caregivers with an early warning of potentially inadequate antinociception.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22344241/

The intraoperative BIS values were downloaded and the BIS trends of confirmed awareness cases were analyzed to determine whether light anesthesia existed.
Of the total 5228 patients, 2919 patients were assigned to Group A and 2309 to Group B. Four cases of confirmed awareness (0.14%) were reported in the BIS-guided group and 15 (0.65%) in the control group (P = 0.002, OR = 0.21, 95% confidence intervals: 0.07 - 0.63). The incidence of possible awareness (0.14% vs. 0.26%, P = 0.485) and dreaming (3.1% vs. 3.1%, P = 0.986) was comparable between BIS-guided group and the control group. Among the 19 confirmed awareness cases, intraoperative BIS trends of six cases were downloaded and identified. Five of them showed signs of light anesthesia as BIS > 60 and lasted 19 - 106 minutes, whereas one case had a stable BIS trend and the values were within 60 during the operation. Another five awareness cases were reviewed for anesthesia procedures, of which improper light anesthesia were confirmed.
BIS-guided TIVA (BIS was recommended to maintain between 40 - 60) decreased the risk of awareness compared with routine TIVA. The main reason for awareness was light anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22340221/

It uses electroencephalographic signals to measure the level of sedation. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced changes in electroencephalography last for several hours to days. How this affects BIS values is unknown.
In 30 patients with schizophrenia or mood disorders who were prescribed ECT (bitemporal, brief-pulse ECT), BIS values were obtained before the start of anesthesia on the first (baseline), fourth (48 hours after the third ECT), and seventh ECT (48 hours after the sixth ECT) sessions. Bispectral index values were recorded in resting state and during a short conversation a few minutes before the induction of anesthesia. The changes in BIS values through the course of ECT were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance and the McNemar test.
Mean (SD) resting BIS value dropped from 91.6 (6.6) at baseline to 79.7 (20.2) after the sixth ECT (repeated-measures analysis of variance occasion effect: F = 6.78; df = 2,58; P = 0.02). The drop in corresponding values during conversation was not significant. The proportion of patients whose resting BIS values were in the sedated/anesthetized range increased from 26% at baseline to 60% after the sixth ECT session (McNemar test: P = 0.031).
Bispectral index values of awake individuals in resting state drop significantly through a course of bitemporal brief-pulse ECT. Anesthesiologists should be aware that a considerable proportion of patients who have received a course of ECT may have BIS values in the sedated/anesthetized range even when they are awake. The BIS may not provide accurate estimation of the depth of anesthesia during ECT after the initial ECT sessions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22330703/

EEG data of 40 patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia with either sevoflurane/remifentanil or propofol/remifentanil were replayed to an EEG player and reanalysed by a BIS A-2000® monitor and a Cerebral State Monitor. Further, research into differences between CSI and BIS index values was performed, e.g., extraction of differences of ≥ 10 and ≥ 20 index points and of the EEG length with differing index values.
The overall correlation coefficient was 0.68 without significant difference between propofol or sevoflurane group. In 51.8% of all recordings, both EEG monitors agreed in their classification of the anesthetic level. The number and length of differing index pairs was influenced by varying time delays of index calculation and different algorithms of index computation.
In contrast to previous studies, our current approach combines the following conditions: analysis on basis of identical underlying EEG data from deep to light anesthesia, no guidance of anesthetic administration by one of the EEG-based monitors, avoidance of simultaneous EEG readings and the use of two different anesthetic regimens. Though the result of EEG analysis during anesthesia is similar with both monitors, CSI performance during propofol anesthesia was superior to sevoflurane anesthesia. Consequently, a lower agreement of classification of anesthetic levels between BIS and CSI was reached with the use of sevoflurane. Thus, CSI calculation seems not to be independent from anesthetic agent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22310192/

We determined thiopental dose requirements for induction of anaesthesia, and the effects of remifentanil on cardiovascular and bispectral index (BIS) responses to tracheal intubation in spinal cord-injured (SCI) patients undergoing general anaesthesia.
Twenty patients with traumatic complete SCI undergoing elective surgery were enrolled. Twenty patients without SCI served as control. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopental, followed by remifentanil 1 μg/kg and rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg, and maintained with 2% sevoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen after tracheal intubation. Thiopental was administered at a rate of 50 mg/15 s until abolition of the eyelash reflex. Thiopental doses, BIS values, systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR) and plasma catecholamine concentrations were measured.
Total thiopental dose required to abolish the eyelash reflex based on total body weight (BW) (5.26 ± 0.87 vs. 3.91 ± 1.07 mg/kg, P < 0.001) or lean BW (6.56 ± 1.37 vs. 5.24 ± 1.36 mg/kg, P < 0.01) were significantly smaller in the SCI group than in the control. SAP was decreased by induction of anaesthesia with thiopental and remifentanil, and increased by tracheal intubation in both groups. However, the peak SAP after intubation was smaller in the SCI patients. HR increased significantly above baseline values following intubation in both groups with no significant intergroup differences. Hypertension was more frequent in the control group. Norepinephrine concentrations remained unaltered following intubation in both groups.
These results suggest that the dose requirements of thiopental for induction of general anaesthesia and subsequent tracheal intubation are reduced in the SCI patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22288930/

Its excellent haemodynamic tolerance gives it a wide therapeutic index. This halogenated agent can abolish movement [minimal alveolar concentration (MAC)] or haemodynamic responses (MACBAR) to noxious stimulus in children as in adults. Reflex pupillary dilatation (RPD) has been demonstrated as a very sensitive measure of noxious stimulation. In order to investigate the effect of sevoflurane on the RPD, a subcortical reflex, we determined the MAC of sevoflurane inhibiting the RPD in 50% of the subjects in response to skin incision (MACpup) in pre- and post-pubertal subjects.
We included 30 pre-pubertal children and 19 post-pubertal subjects. Patients received sevoflurane at preselected concentrations according to an 'up and down' design, and after a steady-state period, skin incision was performed. The RPD was considered as significant when the pupillary diameter increased by more than 100%. Heart rate (HR) and bispectral index (BIS) changes were analysed according to the pupillary response.
The MACpup of sevoflurane was 4.8% (95% confidence interval, 4.6-5.1%) in pre-pubertal children vs 3.4% (3.5-3.3%) in post-pubertal subjects (P<0.001). Inhibition of RPD was always associated with lack of significant HR response. In pre-pubertal children receiving high concentrations of sevoflurane, RPD in response to noxious stimulation was frequently associated with lack of HR response and low BIS values.
MACpup was higher than MAC and close to the MACBAR. Inhibition of RPD in pre-pubertal children required higher sevoflurane concentrations compared with post-pubertal subjects, suggesting that the relationship between the brain structure sensitivities may differ with brain maturation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22265901/

The purpose of this randomized, single-blind clinical trial was to evaluate whether BIS monitoring of sedation would lead to improved oxygenation and a reduced rate of cardiopulmonary complications during endoscopy.
Patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) under procedural sedation with a combination of low dose midazolam and propofol were randomly assigned to either standard monitoring of sedation only (BIS-blinded arm) or an open arm in which additional BIS monitoring was available (BIS-open arm). In the BIS-open arm, propofol administration was to be withheld if BIS values were <55. The primary study end point was the mean oxygen saturation per patient. Secondary end points were the rates of cardiopulmonary complications, propofol dose, quality of sedation (patient cooperation as rated by the endoscopist and patient satisfaction), and recovery.
A total of 144 patients were enrolled and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Mean oxygen saturation per patient was 97.7% in the BIS-open arm and 97.6% in the BIS-blinded arm (P=0.71). Total rates of cardiopulmonary complications, single numbers of hypoxemic, bradycardic, and hypotensive events, mean propofol doses, and quality of sedation also showed no statistically significant differences between the groups. However, BIS monitoring did result in faster recovery of patients as reflected by shorter times to eye opening (P=0.001), first verbal response (P=0.02), and leaving the procedure room (P<0.001).
The use of additional BIS monitoring did not lead to improved oxygenation or a reduced rate of cardiopulmonary complications. Recovery times after the procedure were shorter than with standard monitoring alone, but the clinical benefit for daily practice may be limited.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22261747/

We prospectively studied 102 patients receiving propofol-sufentanil anaesthesia administered by anaesthetists blinded to these indices. The main endpoint was crude agreement (P(0)), defined as the proportion of agreement between BIS and SE index among three categories: <40, between 40 and 60, and >60. Discrepancies in recommendation (DR) were also considered. A DR is type 1 if BIS or SE is <40, while the other is simultaneously >60. A DR is type 2 when BIS and SE index values are on different sides of a threshold (40 or 60) with three subtypes according to the magnitude of their difference. A linear multiple regression was performed to identify covariates that are independently associated with P(0).
In total, 12 147 pairs of values were studied. P(0) was 59.9 (24.5%) [mean (sd)]. Thirty-three patients presented more than 50% discordant pairs and only seven patients presented more than 95% concordant pairs. Type 1 DR occurred in only 1.1% of all the pairs. The median (inter-quartile range) number of type 2 DR varied from 5 (3-8) to 2 (1-3) according to the degree of difference. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P=0.0004) and electrode position (P=0.0084) were independently associated with P(0). An increase in the age of 10 yr decreases P(0) by 5%.

We report on modeling of the data and simulations of dosage regimens for future study.
A phase I, single-center, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, randomized, single-dose escalation study was conducted. Fifty-four healthy subjects in 9 groups received a single 1-minute IV infusion of remimazolam (0.01-0.3 mg/kg). There were 18 control subjects taking midazolam and 9 placebos. Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling of the data was undertaken and the parameters obtained were used for Monte-Carlo simulations of alternative dosing regimens.
A 4-compartment mammillary pharmacokinetic model of midazolam and a physiologically based recirculation model of remimazolam were fitted to the observed plasma levels. The recirculation model of remimazolam explained the observed high venous, compared with arterial, concentrations at later time points. The 2 models were used to simulate the arterial concentrations required for the pharmacodynamic models of sedation (Bispectral Index and Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation [MOAA/S]) and gave population mean pharmacodynamic parameters as follows: Bispectral Index-IC(50): 0.26, 0.07 μg/mL; γ: 1.6, 8.6; k(e0): 0.14, 0.053 min(-1); I(MAX): 39, 19, and MOAA/S-IC(50): 0.4, 0.08 μg/mL; γ: 1.4, 3.4; k(e0): 0.25, 0.050 min(-1) for remimazolam and midazolam, respectively. Simulations to obtain >70% of the population with MOAA/S scores of 2 to 4 were developed. This criterion was achieved (95% confidence intervals: 67%-74%) with a 6-mg initial loading dose of remimazolam followed by 3-mg maintenance doses at >2-minute intervals. Recovery to a MOAA/S score of 5 is predicted to be within 16 minutes for 89% (95% confidence intervals: 87%-91%) of the treated population after this loading/maintenance dose regimen.
Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models developed for remimazolam and midazolam fitted the observed data well. Simulations based on these models show that remimazolam delivers extremely rapid sedation, with maximal effect being reached within 3 minutes of the start of treatment. This property will enable maintenance doses to be given more accurately than with slower-acting drugs. No covariate effects considered to be clinically relevant were observed, suggesting that dosing by body weight may offer no advantage over fixed doses in terms of consistency of exposure to remimazolam within the weight range studied (65-90 kg).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22253270/

In addition to standard and advanced monitors typically used during cardiac surgery, anesthesiologists may consider monitoring the brain with raw or processed electroencephalography (EEG). There is strong evidence that a protocol incorporating the processed EEG bispectral index (BIS) decreases the incidence intraoperative awareness in comparison with standard practice. However, there is conflicting evidence that incorporating the BIS into cardiac anesthesia practice improves ""fast-tracking,"" decreases anesthetic drug use, or detects cerebral ischemia. Recent research, including many cardiac surgical patients, shows that a protocol based on BIS monitoring is not superior to a protocol based on end-tidal anesthetic concentration monitoring in preventing awareness. There has been a resurgence of interest in the anesthesia literature in limited montage EEG monitoring, including nonproprietary processed indices. This has been accompanied by research showing that with structured training, anesthesiologists can glean useful information from the raw EEG trace. In this review, we discuss both the hypothesized benefits and limitations of BIS and frontal channel EEG monitoring in the cardiac surgical population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22253267/

Forty patients of ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status class II-III, undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in a tertiary care hospital in India were randomized to receive isoflurane through a closed-loop system (IAADS group) or through a Tech 7 vaporizer adjusted manually (manual group) to achieve a target BIS of 50. Patients were induced with a propofol infusion and isoflurane was started after intubation. During CPB, patients received propofol; isoflurane was restarted after separation from CPB.

Thirty six children hospitalized in a burn care unit were included and randomly assigned into three groups (G) according to the single IV dose of GHB they received before burn wound care: 10 mg · kg(-1) in G10, 25 mg · kg(-1) in G25, or 50 mg · kg(-1) in G50. All patients received oral premedication (morphine and hydroxyzine) 30 min before GHB injection. Respiratory rate, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index (BIS) were continuously monitored. Depth of sedation was clinically assessed using Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS) Score, every 2 min until recovery (i.e., OAAS = 4).
Median age was 17.5 [12-34] months. Whatever the dose, BIS decreased after IV GHB. Nadir value of BIS was significantly lower in G25 and G50 than in G10, as was for OAAS score. Nadir values were reached after same delays in G25 and G50. Duration of sedation was dose-dependent.
Bispectral index decreased after GHB injection and was correlated with OAAS score. Deep sedation can be safely achieved with IV doses of 25 or 50 mg · kg(-1), but the last dose was associated with prolonged duration of clinical sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22151064/

In the present study, we evaluate the alternative AEP-based auditory-evoked potential index (aepEX) for the measurement of hypnotic depth in patients undergoing general anaesthesia with xenon.
Forty-two patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery were enrolled in this controlled, double-blinded, randomized, clinical study. Patients were randomized to receive either xenon (n=21) or sevoflurane anaesthesia (n=21). During anaesthesia, BIS values were recorded simultaneously with the aepEX monitoring. The anaesthetist performing the anaesthesia was blinded to the hypnotic depth monitors. After surgery, the incidence of recalls and awareness was evaluated.
Patients' characteristics such as gender, age, and weight did not differ between the groups. The aepEX and BIS values behaved similarly during anaesthesia. The comparison of aepEX values during xenon and sevoflurane anaesthesia revealed significantly lower aepEX values in the xenon group after 25 min [xenon: 32.9 (4.8) vs sevoflurane: 39.3 (9.0); P=0.008] and after 35 min [xenon: 31.4 (6.6) vs sevoflurane: 37.0 (6.8); P=0.012]. During anaesthesia, aepEX values correlated with the clinical evaluation of depth of anaesthesia (e.g. >20% changes of the baseline arterial pressure or heart rate, spontaneous breathing and/or intolerance of mechanical ventilation, coughing, abdominal pressing, sweating, eye tearing).
We found the aepEX monitor to provide index in the range of adequate depth of xenon anaesthesia, when combined with remifentanil infusion in intubated patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22139005/

After administering alfentanil bolus, 500 patients were randomized to either propofol infusion titrated to a BIS level of 65-75 (study group) or incremental midazolam bolus based on clinical judgment to achieve moderate sedation. The primary endpoint was safety, while the secondary endpoints were recovery time, patient tolerance, and cooperation.
The proportion of patients with hypoxemia or hypotensive events were not different in the 2 groups (study vs. control groups: 39.9% vs. 35.7%, p = 0.340; 7.4% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.159, respectively). The mean lowest blood pressure was lower in the study group. Logistic regression revealed male gender, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, and electrocautery were associated with hypoxemia, whereas lower propofol dose for induction was associated with hypotension in the study group.

We enrolled 46 patients, mechanically ventilated for almost 12 hours, monitored at a basal level and during a stimulus (tracheal suctioning). As outcome variables we analyzed: length of ventilation and PICU stay, duration of sedative therapy and weaning, time between beginning of sedative administration and start of weaning, presence of infection.
Twenty-six percent (doctor CBS score), 34.8% (nurse CBS score) and 73.9% (BIS) of our population were found adequately sedated; none state of undersedation was reported. During the stimulus the percentage of adequately sedated patients according to CBS became 78.2%. CBS level of agreement versus BIS was weak. No significative difference was found between doctor and nurse CBS score. Length of PICU stay and duration of sedative administered were significant shorter in patients adequately sedated at Bispectral Index monitoring; no outcome variable resulted significant looking at CBS score.

Moreover, many patients have concomitant epilepsy and are medicated with oral antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), which influence the drug-metabolizing enzymes. In particular, valproate (VPA) has been demonstrated to inhibit propofol metabolism in vitro. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the clinical influence of oral VPA on the required dose of propofol for sedation, with use of a prospective cohort study design. We studied 45 patients with moderate or severe mental retardation who underwent dental treatment under sedation. Propofol was infused, and sedation was maintained at the same level in all patients using a bispectral index (BIS) monitor. After the completion of treatment for the scheduled patients, patients were divided into those with oral VPA treatment (VPA group: 20 patients) and without any oral antiepileptic treatment (control group: 25 patients). The propofol dose required for sedation and times to the recovery of the eyelash reflex and spontaneous eye opening were evaluated. The median required propofol doses in the VPA and control groups were 4.15 (range 1.97-5.88) and 5.67 (2.92-7.17) mg/kg/h, respectively. We observed a statistically significant difference between the two patient groups with respect to median VPA dose (p < 0.01). However, no statistically significant differences were noted in the time until eyelash reflex recovery or spontaneous eye opening between the two groups.

This cross-sectional study investigated whether preoperative psychological factors can predict anaesthetic requirements and postoperative pain.
Before total thyroidectomy, 100 consecutive women completed the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the pain sensitivity questionnaire (PSQ). Target-controlled propofol was administered for induction of anaesthesia, and sevoflurane-oxygen-air was given to maintain equal depths of anaesthesia, as determined by bispectral index (BIS) monitoring.
Patients with higher anxiety scores (state and trait) required greater amounts of propofol to reach light (BIS=85) and moderate (BIS=75) levels of sedation, but only trait anxiety was significantly associated with propofol requirements in reaching a deep level of sedation (BIS=65). The MAC-hour of sevoflurane was significantly correlated only with PSQ scores. The postoperative pain intensity was significantly correlated with both STAI and PSQ.

Titrating anesthetic administration against the BIS assumes reliable relationships between BIS values, electroencephalogram waveforms, and effect site concentration, beyond loss of responsiveness. Associations among BIS, end-tidal anesthetic concentrations (ETAC), and patient characteristics were examined during anesthetic maintenance, using B-Unaware trial data.
Pharmacokinetically stable ETAC epochs during intraoperative anesthetic maintenance were analyzed. A generalized estimating equation determined independent relationships among BIS, ETAC (in age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration equivalents), patient characteristics, and 1-yr mortality. Further individual and population characteristics were explored graphically.
A total of 3,347,523 data points from 1,100 patients were analyzed over an ETAC range from 0.42 to 1.51 age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration. A generalized estimating equation yielded a best predictive equation: BIS = 62.9-1.6 (if age younger than 60 yr) -1.6 (if female) -2.5 (if American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status more than 3) -2.6 (if deceased at 1 yr) -2.5 (if N2O was not used) -1.4 (if midazolam dose more than 2 mg) -1.3 (if opioid dose more than 50 morphine equivalents) -15.4 × age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration. Although a population relationship between ETAC and BIS was apparent, interindividual variability in the strength and reliability of this relationship was large. Decreases in BIS with increasing ETAC were not reliably observed. Individual-patient linear regression yielded a median slope of -8 BIS/1 age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration (interquartile range -30, 0) and a median correlation coefficient of -0.16 (interquartile range -0.031, -0.50).
Independent of pharmacokinetic confounding, BIS frequently correlates poorly with ETAC, is often insensitive to clinically significant changes in ETAC, and is vulnerable to interindividual variability.

21971395,Does depth of anesthesia monitoring improve postoperative outcomes?,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2011,"Monk TG, Weldon BC","Devices using the electroencephalogram to estimate anesthetic depth have been available since 1996. Despite the use of these monitors for over a decade, there is little agreement among clinicians about the need for or value of depth of anesthesia monitoring. Since the majority of the studies evaluating the impact of depth of anesthesia monitoring on postoperative outcomes have utilized the bispectral index (BIS Covidian), this manuscript will focus on studies with this device. This review will evaluate the evidence that BIS monitoring can improve long-term outcomes.
BIS-guided anesthesia can reduce the incidence of awareness with recall in high-risk patients, but a recent study found that anesthetic management directed by an end-tidal anesthetic-agent concentration protocol is equally effective, and probably less expensive. Deep anesthesia (BIS < 45) during the intraoperative period is associated with increased postoperative mortality, but this relationship may be an epiphenomenon rather than causal.
There is growing concern that anesthetic management and even specific anesthetic agents may worsen outcomes in high-risk patients. There is, however, no conclusive evidence that depth of anesthesia monitors can improve outcomes and no evidenced-based reasons for anesthesia providers to change their current practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21971395/

21903640,Increase of paradoxical excitement response during propofol-induced sedation in hazardous and harmful alcohol drinkers.,British journal of anaesthesia,2011,"Jeong S, Lee HG, Kim WM, Jeong CW, Lee SH, Yoon MH, Choi JI","Paradoxical excitement response during sedation consists of loss of affective control and abnormal movements. Chronic alcohol abuse has been proposed as a predisposing factor despite lack of supporting evidence. Because alcohol and propofol have a common site of action, we postulated that paradoxical excitement responses during propofol-induced sedation occur more frequently in hazardous and harmful alcohol drinkers than in social or non-drinkers.
One hundred and ninety patients undergoing orthopaedic knee joint surgery were enrolled in this prospective and observational study. Subjects were divided into Group HD (hazardous and harmful drinkers) or Group NHD (no hazardous drinkers) according to the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT). In study 1, propofol infusion was adjusted to achieve the bispectral index at 70-80 using target-controlled infusion. In study 2, the target concentration of propofol was fixed at 0.8 (study 2/Low) or 1.4 μg ml(-1) (study 2/High). Paradoxical excitement responses were categorized by intensity into mild, moderate, or severe.
The overall incidence of paradoxical excitement response was higher in Group HD than in Group NHD in study 1 (71.4% vs 43.8%; P=0.022) and study 2/High (70.0% vs 34.5%; P=0.006) but not in study 2/Low. The incidence of moderate-to-severe response was significantly higher in Group HD of study 1 (28.6% vs 3.1%; P=0.0005) and study 2/High (23.3% vs 3.4%; P=0.029) with no difference in study 2/Low. Severe excitement response occurred only in Group HD of study 1 and study 2/High.
Paradoxical excitement occurred more frequently and severely in hazardous and harmful alcohol drinkers than in social drinkers during propofol-induced moderate-to-deep sedation, but not during light sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21903640/

We compared the performance of CSI to the bispectral index (BIS) as electroencephalographic measures of sevoflurane effect using two combined sigmoidal E(max) models.
Twenty adult patients scheduled for laparotomy were studied. After induction of general anesthesia, sevoflurane concentrations were progressively increased and then decreased over 70 min. An analysis of the BIS and CSI with the sevoflurane effect-site concentration was conducted using two combined sigmoidal E(max) models.
The BIS and CSI decreased over the initial concentration range of sevoflurane and then reached a plateau in most patients. A further increase in sevoflurane concentration produced a secondary plateau in the pharmacodynamic response. The CSI was more strongly correlated with effect-site sevoflurane concentration (R(2)=0.95±0.04) than the BIS was (R(2)=0.87±0.07) (P<0.05). The individual E(max) and C(eff50) (effect-site concentration associated with 50% decrease from baseline to plateau) values for the upper and lower plateaus were significantly greater for BIS (12.7±7.3, 1.6±0.4, and 4.2±0.5, respectively) than for CSI (3.4±2.2, 1.2±0.4, and 3.8±0.5, respectively) (P<0.05). The remaining pharmacodynamic parameters for the BIS and CSI were similar.
The overall performance of the BIS and CSI during sevoflurane anesthesia was similar despite major differences in their algorithms. However, the CSI was more consistent and more sensitive to changes in sevoflurane concentration, whereas the measured BIS seemed to respond faster. The newly developed combined E(max) model adequately described the clinical data, including the pharmacodynamic plateau.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21892201/
21865492,The etomidate requirement is decreased in patients with obstructive jaundice.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2011,"Song JC, Sun YM, Zhang MZ, Yang LQ, Tao TZ, Yu WF","Patients with obstructive jaundice have increased sensitivity to inhaled anesthetics. In rodent brain, bilirubin can enhance γ-aminobutyric acid A/glycinergic synaptic transmission. Etomidate is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic that induces sedation through γ-aminobutyric acid A receptors in the central nervous system. We tested the hypothesis that patients with obstructive jaundice have an altered sensitivity to etomidate.
The study design was a comparison of etomidate requirements to reach a Bispectral Index of 50 in patients with obstructive jaundice versus patients with chronic cholelithiasis and normal bilirubin levels. Etomidate was infused at 30 μg/kg/min until this end point was reached.
The etomidate requirement in the obstructive jaundice group was lower than that in the control group (150±46 μg/kg vs 206±74 μg/kg, P=0.007). The average decrease in etomidate requirement was 56 μg/kg (95% confidence interval: 16-96 μg/kg). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation between serum total bilirubin and etomidate requirement with Pearson r of -0.545, and 95% confidence interval for r value (-0.791 to -0.148). All subjects were hemodynamically stable during the study.

We tested the hypothesis that a protocol incorporating the electroencephalogram-derived bispectral index (BIS) is superior to a protocol incorporating standard monitoring of end-tidal anesthetic-agent concentration (ETAC) for the prevention of awareness.
We conducted a prospective, randomized, evaluator-blinded trial at three medical centers. We randomly assigned 6041 patients at high risk for awareness to BIS-guided anesthesia (with an audible alert if the BIS value was <40 or >60, on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the suppression of detectable brain electrical activity and 100 indicating the awake state) or ETAC-guided anesthesia (with an audible alert if the ETAC was <0.7 or >1.3 minimum alveolar concentration). In addition to audible alerts, the protocols included structured education and checklists. Superiority of the BIS protocol was assessed with the use of a one-sided Fisher's exact test.
A total of 7 of 2861 patients (0.24%) in the BIS group, as compared with 2 of 2852 (0.07%) in the ETAC group, who were interviewed postoperatively had definite intraoperative awareness (a difference of 0.17 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.03 to 0.38; P=0.98). Thus, the superiority of the BIS protocol was not demonstrated. A total of 19 cases of definite or possible intraoperative awareness (0.66%) occurred in the BIS group, as compared with 8 (0.28%) in the ETAC group (a difference of 0.38 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.74; P=0.99), with the superiority of the BIS protocol again not demonstrated. There was no difference between the groups with respect to the amount of anesthesia administered or the rate of major postoperative adverse outcomes.
The superiority of the BIS protocol was not established; contrary to expectations, fewer patients in the ETAC group than in the BIS group experienced awareness.

Twenty volunteers participated in this study. Each subject underwent 2 experiments in a randomized crossover manner (propofol group and control group). After control data were obtained, propofol at predicted effect site concentrations of 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 μg/mL was infused in the propofol group using a target controlled infusion system. Heart rate, noninvasive blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and bispectral index value were monitored. Observer's assessment of alertness/sedation and the correct answer rate of the Stroop color word test were assessed. Muscle power, grip strength and bite force were measured.
In the propofol group, the bispectral index value and observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale dose-dependently reduced.

This was a prospective observational trial with waiver of consent conducted in the intensive care unit of Level I trauma center in 94 mechanically ventilated trauma patients sedated with propofol alone or in combination with midazolam. BIS, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), electromyography, and heart rate variability, as a test of autonomic function, were measured for 45 minutes during daily SATs. Data were evaluated with analysis of variance, linear regression, and nonparametric tests.
The BIS wave form coincided almost exactly with propofol on/off. Steady-state BIS correlated with RASS (p < 0.0001) and with propofol dose (p < 0.0001), but the strengths of association were relatively low (all r(2) < 0.5). BIS wave form was not altered by age, heart rate, or heart rate variability and was similar with propofol alone or propofol plus midazolam, but the presence of brain injury or the use of paralytics shifted the curve downward (both p < 0.001). The overall test characteristics for BIS versus RASS without neuromuscular blockade were sensitivity: 90% versus 77% (p = 0.034); specificity: 90% versus 75% (p = 0.021); positive predictive value: 90% versus 76% (p = 0.021), and negative predictive value: 90% versus 76% (p = 0.021).
In the first trial in trauma patients and largest trial in any surgical population, the (1) BIS was reliable and has advantages over RASS of being continuous and objective, at least during a propofol SAT; (2) BIS interpretation remains somewhat subjective in patients receiving paralytic agents or with traumatic brain injury.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21768900/

We studied whether they can differentiate consciousness from unconsciousness during increasing doses of three different anaesthetic agents.
Thirty healthy male volunteers aged 19-30 yr were recruited and divided into three 10-volunteer groups to receive either dexmedetomidine, propofol, or sevoflurane in escalating concentrations at 10 min intervals until loss of consciousness (LOC) was reached. Consciousness was tested at 5 min intervals and after drug discontinuation at 1 min intervals by requesting the subjects to open their eyes. LOC was defined as unresponsiveness to the request and pre-LOC as the last meaningful response. The first meaningful response to the request after drug discontinuation was defined as regaining of consciousness (ROC). For the statistical analysis, pre-LOC and ROC values were pooled to represent the responsive state while LOC values represented the unresponsive state. Prediction probability (P(K)) was estimated with the jack-knife method.
The lowest mean values for BIS, SE, and RE were recorded at LOC with all three drugs. The P(K) values were low for dexmedetomidine (BIS 0.62, SE 0.58, RE 0.59), propofol (BIS 0.73, SE 0.72, RE 0.72), and sevoflurane (BIS 0.70, SE 0.52, RE 0.62).

New malignant diagnoses after surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia were obtained in a prospective cohort of 2972 BIS-monitored patients without any clinically diagnosed malignant disease at the time of index surgery. The risk of cancer during follow-up in relation to T(ANESTH) and T(BIS<45) was assessed by Cox regression. The cancer incidence in this surgical population was compared with the incidence in a standardized general population by calculation of standard incidence ratio.

In this study, we assessed the influence of obesity on the hysteresis between sevoflurane and its effect as measured by the bispectral index (BIS). Because the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in obese patients has improved gas exchange, we also assessed the influence of PEEP on hysteresis.
Fifteen obese and 15 normal-weight patients, ASA physical status I and II, 20 to 50 years old, scheduled to undergo general anesthesia for elective laparoscopic surgery, were prospectively studied. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with sevoflurane and fentanyl. At the end of surgery and after stable BIS values of 60 to 65, the inspired concentration of sevoflurane was increased to 5 vol% for 5 minutes or until BIS was <40 and then decreased. Sevoflurane transitions were performed once in normal-weight subjects (without PEEP) and twice in obese patients (one without PEEP and one with a PEEP of 8 cm H(2)O). The hysteresis between sevoflurane end-tidal concentrations and BIS during these transition periods was modeled with an inhibitory Emax model using a population pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) approach with NONMEM VI. A descriptive analysis of sevoflurane inspired and expired concentrations, BIS values, and time to reach different BIS end points was also used to compare the PK and PD characteristics.
All patients completed the study. The data were adequately fit with the PK/PD model. The hysteresis expressed as the effect-site elimination rate constant was not influenced by body mass index or PEEP (P > 0.05). Neither obesity nor PEEP showed any influence on the PK/PD descriptors.

Twenty-eight children classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 who were given general anesthesia for dental treatment were studied. Anesthesia was given using target-controlled infusion of propofol based on the Kataria model. Propofol target plasma concentration was 7 μg/ml for 15 min, followed by 1 μg/ml for 15 min or until signs of awakening, followed by 5 μg/ml for 15 min.

A classic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was estimated, and the methodology of other studies was duplicated using pharmacokinetic models from the literature and (re-)estimating the pharmacodynamic models.
There is no clear relationship between pharmacokinetic precision and the pharmacodynamic objective function. Low pharmacodynamic objective function values are not associated with accurate estimation of the pharmacodynamic parameters when the pharmacokinetic model is taken from other sources.
Minimization of the pharmacodynamic objective function does not select the most accurate pharmacokinetic model.

After tracheal intubation, we started maintenance of anesthesia with endtidal sevoflurane concentrations of 2.6%. The endtidal sevoflurane concentration at which BIS was measured was predetermined by the up-down method (with 0.2% as a step size). After 10 min at predetermined endtidal sevoflurane concentrations, BIS was measured for 1 min. MAC(BIS50) was determined using Dixon's up-down method and probit test.
MAC(BIS50) of sevoflurane was 2.83% (95% confidence intervals: 2.70-3.14) in children.
MAC(BIS50) of sevoflurane in children was calculated to be three times as high as in adults. This indicates that high endtidal sevoflurane concentration is required to suppress electroencephalogram activity in children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21535300/
21512777,Comparison of spectral entropy and BIS VISTA™ monitor during general anesthesia for cardiac surgery.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2011,"Musialowicz T, Lahtinen P, Pitkänen O, Kurola J, Parviainen I","We compared the primary metrics of the Spectral entropy M-ENTROPY™ module and BIS VISTA™ monitor-i.e., bispectral index (BIS), state entropy (SE), and response entropy (RE) in terms of agreement and correlation during general anesthesia for cardiac surgery. We also evaluated responsiveness of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based and hemodynamic parameters to surgical noxious stimulation, skin incision, and sternotomy, hypothesizing that RE would be a better responsiveness predictor.
BIS and entropy sensors were applied before anesthesia induction in 32 patients having elective cardiac surgery. Total intravenous anesthesia was standardized and guided by the BIS index with neuromuscular blockade tested with train-of-four monitoring. Parameters included SE, RE, BIS, forehead electromyography (EMG), and hemodynamic variables. Time points for analyzing BIS, entropy, and hemodynamic values were 1 min before and after: anesthesia induction, intubation, skin incision, sternotomy, cannulation of the aorta, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), cross-clamping the aorta, de-clamping the aorta, and end of CPB; also after starting the re-warming phase and at 10, 20, 30, and 40 min following.
The mean difference between BIS and SE (Bland-Altman) was 2.14 (+16/- 11; 95% CI 1.59-2.67), and between BIS and RE it was 0.02 (+14/- 14; 95% CI 0.01-0.06). BIS and SE (r(2) = 0.66; P = 0.001) and BIS and RE (r(2) = 0.7; P = 0.001) were closely correlated (Pearson's). EEG parameters, EMG values, and systolic blood pressure significantly increased after skin incision, and sternotomy. The effect of surgical stimulation (Cohen's d) was highest for RE after skin incision (-0.71; P = 0.0001) and sternotomy (-0.94; P = 0.0001).
Agreement was poor between the BIS index measured by BIS VISTA™ and SE values at critical anesthesia time points in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. RE was a good predictor of arousal after surgical stimulation regardless of the surgical level of muscle relaxation. Index differences most likely resulted from different algorithms for calculating consciousness level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21512777/

While BIS® monitors might aid anesthetic management, unprocessed or nonproprietary electroencephalographic data may be a rich source of information for clinicians. We hypothesized that anesthesiologists, after training in electroencephalography interpretation, could estimate the index of a reference BIS as accurately as a second BIS® monitor (twin BIS®) (Covidien Medical, Boulder, CO) when provided with clinical and electroencephalographic data.
Two sets of electrodes connected to two separate BIS® monitors were placed on the foreheads of 10 surgical patients undergoing general anesthesia. Electroencephalographic parameters, vital signs, and end-tidal anesthetic gas concentrations were recorded at prespecified time points, and were provided to two sets of anesthesiologists. Ten anesthesiologists received brief structured training in electroencephalograph interpretation and 10 were untrained. Although electroencephalographic waveforms and open-source processed electroencephalograph metrics were provided from the reference BIS®, both groups were blinded to BIS values and were asked to estimate BIS.
The trained anesthesiologists averaged as close to or closer to the reference BIS® compared with the twin BIS® monitor for 34% of their BIS estimates versus 26% for the untrained anesthesiologists. Using linear mixed effects model analysis, there was a statistically significant difference between the trained and untrained anesthesiologists (P = 0.02), but no difference between the twin BIS® monitor and trained anesthesiologists (P = 0.9).
With limited electroencephalography training and access to clinical data, anesthesiologists can estimate the BIS almost as well as a second BIS® monitor. These results reinforce the potential utility of training anesthesia practitioners in unprocessed electroencephalogram interpretation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21460704/

A 22-year-old man, who was diagnosed with narcolepsy at the age of 17, requested endoscopic sinus surgery, under general anesthesia, for chronic allergic rhinitis. On the morning of the day of operation, he took his daily dose of modafinil, used to control narcolepsy. Anesthesia was induced by 5% sevoflurane and maintained with sevoflurane and continuous infusion of remifentanil and 60% oxygen in conjunction with BIS monitoring. BIS values were between 47 and 58. Duration of surgery was 150 min. After surgery, the patient emerged from anesthesia within 10 min and was extubated. His recovery was uneventful. We found the use of BIS monitoring for titrating sevoflurane concentration in a narcoleptic patient is useful for preventing not only oversedation but also intraoperative awareness caused by the preoperative medication.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21448767/

As the number of cases in the office-based setting increase, many clinicians opt to intubate patients without neuromuscular blockade to avoid airway complications associated with skeletal muscle relaxation. Conventionally, this technique is conducted using the traditional monitoring criteria of vital signs, end-tidal inhalation agents, as well as anesthesiologist timing and knowledge of the pharmacodynamics of the anesthetic agent to help determine the proper depth of anesthesia for adequate intubating conditions. This study retrospectively assesses the use of the Bispectral Index System (BIS) as a guide for timing of nonparalytic tracheal intubation in pediatric office-based general anesthesia. Anesthetic records for 168 children, American Society of Anesthesiology physical status I and II, and ranging in age from 18 months to 17 years were retrospectively analyzed. Intubation outcomes were based on 6 preset criteria to reflect the adequacy of the technique. The mean BIS value during the time of intubation was 34.7. There were no complications encountered.

Therefore, we studied whether the AA reduces intraoperative analgesic requirement during total hip arthroplasty (THA).
One hundred and twenty patients scheduled for THA were enrolled in this patient-anesthesiologist-blinded study. The patients were randomly assigned to receive needling of specific AA points or a sham procedure (needling of 3 nonacupoints on the ear helix) ipsilateral to the surgery site. Fixed indwelling AA needles were placed in the evening before THA and withdrawn on the day after surgery. The patients received general anesthesia with desflurane, which end-tidal concentration was kept within 3.5 volume % to 5.5 volume % to maintain the Bispectral Index within 40% to 55%. The anesthesiologists were asked to titrate fentanyl to keep the heart rate and blood pressure within 20% of baseline values. The primary outcome was fentanyl amount given during surgery. The secondary outcome measures were incidence of nausea and vomiting and time to first request of analgesics in the recovery room. The success of patients' and anesthesiologist blinding was also documented.
The data of fentanyl requirement of 116 patients were available for the final analysis. Patients from AA group required 15% less fentanyl during surgery than the controls (4.6±1.1 μg/kg vs. 5.2±1.3 μg/kg; mean±SD; P=0.008). Demographic data and secondary outcome measures were comparable in both groups.

The aim of this study was to compare onset time, hypnosis level and the haemodynamic response after thiopental vs. propofol for induction of anaesthesia. Our primary hypothesis was that in the elderly, thiopental had a shorter onset time than propofol, defined as time to bispectral index (BIS) <50.
In this randomized and double-blinded study, we included 78 patients. Patients were eligible, if they were scheduled for elective surgery with general anaesthesia and aged 60 or older. Patients received alfentanil 10 μg/kg and either thiopental 2.5 mg/kg or propofol 1.0 mg/kg, and depth of anaesthesia was determined with BIS the following 120 s along with clinical assessment of anaesthetic depth. The primary endpoint was the time from start of injection of the hypnotic to a BIS value below 50.
Time to BIS <50 was significantly shorter in patients receiving thiopental, where onset time was 52 s (median value) compared with 65 s in the propofol group (P=0.01). Mean arterial pressure decreased 25.6 mmHg in the propofol group and 15.6 mmHg in the thiopental group (P=0.003) within 120 s. Heart rate decreased 9.1 b.p.m. within 120 s in the patients receiving propofol compared with a decrease of 5.1 b.p.m. in patients receiving thiopental (P=0.04).

Plasma dexmedetomidine concentrations were measured for 10 h, and pharmacokinetic variables were calculated with standard noncompartmental methods. Heart rate, blood pressure, concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline in plasma, and central nervous system drug effects (with the Maddox wing, Bispectral Index, and three visual analog scales) were monitored to assess the pharmacological effects of dexmedetomidine.
Six individuals were included in the analyses. Following intranasal administration, peak plasma concentrations of dexmedetomidine were reached in 38 (15-60) min and its absolute bioavailability was 65% (35-93%) (medians and ranges). Pharmacological effects were similar with both routes of administration, but their onset was more rapid after intravenous administration.

In this randomized double-blinded study, we evaluated the effects of preoperative caudal block on sevoflurane requirements in children with cerebral palsy (CP) undergoing lower limb surgery while bispectral index (BIS) values were maintained between 45 and 55.
52 children undergoing Achilles-tendon lengthening were randomized to receive combined general-caudal anesthesia (caudal group, n = 27) or general anesthesia alone (control group, n = 25). Caudal block was performed with a single dose of 0.7 ml·kg(-1) of 1.0% lidocaine containing epinephrine at 5 μg·ml(-1). The control group received no preoperative caudal block. The endtidal sevoflurane concentrations (ET(sev)) were adjusted every minute to maintain the BIS values between 45 and 55.
The ET(sev) required to maintain the BIS values were not significantly different between the control and caudal groups after induction of anesthesia [2.1 (0.2) vs 2.2 (0.4); P = 0.773]. However, significantly higher ET(sev) was observed in the control group before surgical incision [2.0 (0.2) vs 1.8 (0.3); P = 0.013] and during the first 20 min after surgical incision [2.2 (0.3) vs 1.4 (0.3); P < 0.001]. There was no significant difference in BIS values between the control and caudal groups throughout the study period (P > 0.05). In the caudal group, the caudal block was successful in 25 of 27 (92.6%) patients.
Caudal block effectively reduced sevoflurane requirements by 36% compared to general anesthesia alone in children with CP undergoing lower limb surgery while BIS values were maintained between 45 and 55.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21299684/

This substudy of the B-Unaware Trial tested whether cumulative duration of BIS values lower than 45, cumulative anesthetic dose, comorbidities, or intraoperative events were independently associated with postoperative mortality.
The authors studied 1,473 patients (mean ± SD age, 57.9 ± 14.4 yr; 749 men) who underwent noncardiac surgery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to determine whether perioperative factors were independently associated with all-cause mortality.
A total of 358 patients (24.3%) died during a follow-up of 3.2 ± 1.1 yr. There were statistically significant associations among various perioperative risk factors, including malignancy and intermediate-term mortality. BIS-monitored patients did not have lower mortality than unmonitored patients (24.9 vs. 23.7%; difference = 1.2%, 95% CI, -3.3 to 5.6%). Cumulative duration of BIS values less than 45 was not associated with mortality (multivariable hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.93-1.14). Increasing mean and cumulative end-tidal anesthetic concentrations were not associated with mortality. The multivariable Cox regression model showed a good discriminative ability (c-index = 0.795).
This study found no evidence that either cumulative BIS values below a threshold of 40 or 45 or cumulative inhalational anesthetic dose is injurious to patients. These results do not support the hypothesis that limiting depth of anesthesia either by titration to a specific BIS threshold or by limiting end-tidal volatile agent concentrations will decrease postoperative mortality.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21293252/
21252649,Cost-effectiveness of bispectral index monitoring.,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2011,"Klopman MA, Sebel PS","In the current era of limited resources, organizations are evaluating the cost-effectiveness of their care. To analyze the cost-effectiveness of a physiologic monitor, one must first determine what negative outcome will be reduced or what positive outcome will be promoted. For example, if one was studying the cost-effectiveness of the pulse oximeter, it would be important to state whether the endpoint is prevention of hypoxic events or prevention of myocardial infarction. One would then need outcome data demonstrating the incidence of the chosen endpoint with and without the monitor. With these data, one can begin to construct a model for cost-effectiveness. Like many medical technologies, the bispectral index (BIS) monitor has recently been the subject of several articles which study its cost-effectiveness. This review examines the rationale of cost-effectiveness analyses and their application specifically to the BIS monitor.
The BIS monitor has been shown in multiple prospective randomized studies to positively affect several important aspects of an anesthetic. Use of the BIS monitor results in less use of hypnotic anesthetic drugs, decreased time to extubation, decreased incidence of nausea and vomiting, and decreased intraoperative awareness. These benefits are achieved for an additional cost of around five dollars per anesthetic. In addition, there is an emerging body of literature demonstrating an association between low intraoperative BIS readings and decreasing intermediate-term survival in both noncardiac and cardiac surgical patients.
Given the trivial cost of the BIS and the proven benefits demonstrated in prospective randomized studies, we consider its use justified in every general anesthetic.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21252649/

The controller was compared with manual target-controlled infusion.
In a multicenter study, 196 surgical patients were randomly assigned to dual closed-loop or manual administration of propofol and remifentanil. Comparison between groups was evaluated by calculating a global score that characterized the overall performance of the controller including the percentage of adequate anesthesia, defined as BIS between 40 and 60, the median absolute performance error, and wobble. Secondary outcomes included occurrence of burst suppression ratio, time to tracheal extubation, and drug consumption.
Eighty-three patients assigned to dual-loop control and 84 patients assigned to manual control completed the study. The global score and the percentage of time with BIS between 40 and 60 were better in the dual-loop group (26 ± 11 vs 43 ± 40, P < 0.0001; 82% ± 12% vs 71% ± 19%, P < 0.0001). Overshoot (BIS <40), undershoot (BIS >60), and burst suppression ratio were all significantly less common in the dual-loop group. Modifications to the propofol and remifentanil infusions were more frequent, and adjustments smaller in the dual-loop group. Remifentanil consumption was greater (0.22 ± 0.07 vs 0.16 ± 0.07 μg · kg(-1) · min(-1); P < 0.0001) and the speed to tracheal extubation was shorter (10 ± 4 vs 11 ± 5 minutes; P = 0.02) in the dual-loop group.

A convenience sample of nine patients with various diagnoses participated in this observational repeated measures study. Patients were observed during 2 minute periods at rest (baseline), and during procedures known to be painful: turning and endotracheal suctioning. Both the BIS index and the CPOT score were found to increase when patients were exposed to procedures compared with rest, and were found to be more sensitive to procedures compared with vital signs. Indeed, vital signs remained quite stable during procedures in this sample. Results from this study support the recommendation that behavioural indicators (i.e. in this case, the use of a behavioural pain scale called the CPOT) be used for the detection of pain in nonverbal ICU patients. However, in some situations (e.g. deep sedation, use of blocking agents), behavioural indicators may no longer be observable, and all that is left are physiologic signs.

A questionnaire survey was conducted via the Internet. The survey was designed to obtain information regarding cases involving intraoperative awareness in 2008.
A total of 172 anesthesiologists answered the survey. The total number of reported anesthetic cases was 85,156. Twenty-four cases of definite or possible awareness were reported by 21 anesthesiologists, of which 14 were cases of definite awareness and ten of possible awareness. The incidence of awareness, including possible awareness, was 0.028%. Propofol was used in 21 cases, sevoflurane in two, and a high dose of fentanyl in one. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring was used in seven cases (29%). Sixteen patients (67%) were <50 years old, six (26%) were men, and 17 (74%) were women. As the type of surgery, three cases (13%) involved gynecological surgeries and seven (30%) involved cervicofacial surgeries. During surgery, the memory at postural change was preserved in two cases.
The most surprising finding of this study is that total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) was used in 21 of the 24 (88%) cases of definite and possible awareness. Although the incidence of intraoperative awareness was compatible with the previous studies, meticulous care should be taken when anesthesia is performed by TIVA for high-risk patients.

One hundred twenty patients undergoing ultrasonographic endoscopy were randomized to receive, by means of a target-controlled infusion system, a fixed effect-site concentration of either propofol or remifentanil of 8 different possible concentrations, allowing adjustment of the concentrations of the other drug. Predicted effect-site propofol (C(e)pro) and remifentanil (C(e)remi) concentrations, parameters derived from auditory evoked potential, autoregressive auditory evoked potential index (AAI/2) and electroencephalogram (bispectral index [BIS] and index of consciousness [IoC]) signals, as well as categorical scores of sedation (Ramsay Sedation Scale [RSS] score) in the presence or absence of nociceptive stimulation, were collected, recorded, and analyzed using an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System. The models described for the relationship between C(e)pro and C(e)remi versus AAI/2, BIS, and IoC were diagnosed for inaccuracy using median absolute performance error (MDAPE) and median root mean squared error (MDRMSE), and for bias using median performance error (MDPE). The models were validated in a prospective group of 68 new patients receiving different combinations of propofol and remifentanil. The predictive ability (P(k)) of AAI/2, BIS, and IoC with respect to the sedation level, RSS score, was also explored.
Data from 110 patients were analyzed in the training group. The resulting estimated models had an MDAPE of 32.87, 12.89, and 8.77; an MDRMSE of 17.01, 12.81, and 9.40; and an MDPE of -1.86, 3.97, and 2.21 for AAI/2, BIS, and IoC, respectively, in the absence of stimulation and similar values under stimulation. P(k) values were 0.82, 0.81, and 0.85 for AAI/2, BIS, and IoC, respectively. The model predicted the prospective validation data with an MDAPE of 34.81, 14.78, and 10.25; an MDRMSE of 16.81, 15.91, and 11.81; an MDPE of -8.37, 5.65, and -1.43; and P(k) values of 0.81, 0.8, and 0.8 for AAI/2, BIS, and IoC, respectively.
A model relating C(e)pro and C(e)remi to AAI/2, BIS, and IoC has been developed and prospectively validated. Based on these models, the (C(e)pro, C(e)remi) concentration pairs that provide an RSS score of 4 range from (1.8 μg·mL(-1), 1.5 ng·mL(-1)) to (2.7 μg·mL(-1), 0 ng·mL(-1)). These concentrations are associated with AAI/2 values of 25 to 30, BIS of 71 to 75, and IoC of 72 to 76. The presence of noxious stimulation increases the requirements of C(e)pro and C(e)remi to achieve the same degree of sedative effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21131550/

Hepatic encephalopathy featuring extreme excitement developed in a 42-year-old male and was diagnosed as acute hepatitis. Sedation with continuous infusion of midazolam was necessary. BIS value gradually decreased and reached 0 17 h after commencement of continuous infusion of midazolam. Midazolam infusion was stopped but BIS value remained 0. Brain CT scan revealed an almost normal image. Multi-lead electroencephalogram was recorded revealing almost no electrical activity. Administration of flumazenil did not improve his consciousness and BIS value. Adequate spontaneous respiration was maintained and the possibility of brain death was excluded. LDLT was performed on the 5th ICU day. BIS value remained 0 throughout surgery. BIS value suddenly increased 2 h after surgery and reached 60 11 h after surgery. It became possible to communicate with the patient and his trachea was extubated on the 4th postoperative day. We believe that, with BIS, we were able to follow preoperative exacerbation of the ""pathological"" process of hepatic encephalopathy, and predict postoperative emergence from general anesthesia, suggesting normal graft function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21127916/

In this article, the effect of music and noise on patients during MAC was assessed. The Bispectral Index (BIS) Monitor was used to evaluate the effect of music on the level of sedation or anesthesia in the articles reviewed. A review of current literature was completed regarding the use of music in the OR during MAC cases and its relationship to propofol sedation requirements. Ten journal articles were reviewed with publication dates ranging from 1997 to 2009. The use of music as an anesthetic adjunct during MAC cases can reduce the amount of sedation required, speed recovery time, and prevent the likelihood of converting to a general anesthetic.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21126669/

Anesthesia was maintained with 50% oxygen in nitrous oxide with sevoflurane. Sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to sustain a constant Bispectral Index (BIS) value of 40-55. Prolactin, progesterone and cortisol levels were evaluated immediately before cesarean delivery.
End-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane in the Prelabor group were higher than in the Labor group with similar Bispectral Index values. No significant differences were found in prolactin, progesterone and cortisol levels between the two groups.

21104443,The role of the ADRA2A C1291G genetic polymorphism in response to dexmedetomidine on patients undergoing coronary artery surgery.,Molecular biology reports,2011,"Yağar S, Yavaş S, Karahalil B","The existence of interindividual drug response variability has been known for a long time. Individual susceptibility which might cause toxicity or inadequate treatment is important in drug therapy. Genetic polymorphisms in genes responsible for drug response are expected to be useful in keeping track of differences among individuals. Dexmedetomidine is a sedative drug, whose use in intensive care unit patients was confirmed by USA-Food Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of 1999. It was proven that dexmedetomidine shows its clinic effect via the α(2)-AR. However, to the best of our knowledge, to date, there is no investigation in clinic indicating the relation between dexmedetomidine and α(2A)-AR gene polymorphism. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between the effect of α(2A)-Adrenergic Receptor (ADRA2A) C-1291G gene polymorphism in the promoter region of the candidate gene and clinical effects (sedative and haemodynamics effects) of dexmedetomidine. One hundred and ten patients undergoing coronary artery surgery were prospectively studied. Anesthetic technique was standardized with fentanyl, midazolam and rocuronium bromide. Patients were monitorized with Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor in addition to the routine invasive haemodynamic monitorization in the operation room. The Ramsay Sedation Scale was also used in order to determine the sedation level just arriving to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The genotyping of ADRA2A C1291G was done by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RFLP-PCR). We found the frequencies of C1291C, C1291G and G1291G genotypes, as 43.6, 45.5 and 10.9%, respectively. Patients who carry variant genotype had higher BIS and Ramsay Sedation Scores, indicating a longer period for falling asleep. The results of our study are promising, considering the association between ADRA2A polymorphism and response to dexmedetomidine. However, further investigations on other ADRA2A locus or haplotypes might be useful to clarify the relation between this gene and dexmedetomidine activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21104443/
20966443,Remifentanil decreases sevoflurane requirements to block autonomic hyperreflexia during transurethral litholapaxy in patients with high complete spinal cord injury.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2011,"Yoo KY, Jeong CW, Kim SJ, Jeong ST, Kim WM, Lee HK, Oh KJ, Lee JU, Shin MH, Chung SS","An inhaled anesthetic concentration required to block autonomic hyperreflexia (AHR) is high enough to cause severe hypotension in patients with high spinal cord injury (SCI). We determined the effects of remifentanil on the sevoflurane requirement to block AHR in SCI.
The study involved 96 patients with chronic, complete SCI scheduled to undergo transurethral litholapaxy during general anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental, and sevoflurane concentrations in 50% nitrous oxide were adjusted to maintain a bispectral index of 40 to 50. Whether the patient develops an AHR [an increase of systolic blood pressure (SBP) >20 to 40 mm Hg] was first examined by distending the bladder with glycine solution (the first trial). Patients who developed AHR were then allocated to receive no remifentanil infusion (control, n = 31), a target-controlled plasma concentration of 1 ng/mL (n = 25), or 3 ng/mL remifentanil (n = 24). After baseline hemodynamics had recovered, the target sevoflurane and remifentanil concentrations were maintained for at least 20 minutes and the procedure was resumed (the second trial). Each target sevoflurane concentration was determined by the up-and-down method based on changes (15% increase or more) of SBP in response to the bladder distension. SBP, heart rate, and bispectral index were measured before and during the bladder distension during the trials, and plasma concentrations of catecholamines during the first trial.
Eighty-two (85.4%) of 96 patients developed AHR during the first trial, in which 2 were excluded because of hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure <50 mm Hg) developed during target-controlled drug administration. During the second trial, the end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane to prevent AHR were reduced to 2.6% (95% confidence interval 2.5% to 2.8%, P < 0.01) and 2.2% (2.1% to 2.4%, P < 0.0001) in the groups receiving 1 and 3 ng/mL remifentanil, respectively, in comparison with 3.1% (2.9% to 3.3%) in the control. When considering minimum anesthetic concentration (MAC) values and the contribution of 50% nitrous oxide (0.48 MAC), the combined MAC values, expressed as multiples of MAC, were 2.27, 1.98, and 1.75 in the control, 1 ng/mL remifentanil, and 3 ng/mL remifentanil groups, respectively.
Target-controlled concentrations of 1 and 3 ng/mL remifentanil would reduce the requirement of sevoflurane combined with 50% nitrous oxide to block AHR by 16% and 29%, respectively, in SCI patients undergoing transurethral litholapaxy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20966443/

This paper presents a successful procedure to estimate the varying TD of the bispectral index (BIS) monitor used in closed-loop control during intensive care. The TD estimation (TDE) is based on the cross-correlation analysis technique and the method is validated with real measured signals of propofol and BIS. Extended prediction self-adaptive control is used in combination with a Smith predictor to reduce the computational burden imposed by the variable TD. The conclusion is that an online TDE of the BIS monitor improves the performance of the closed-loop system for reference tracking, disturbance rejection, and overall stability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20959260/

All patients were given a standard sevoflurane in oxygen anesthetic with ASA standard monitoring. A research assistant who was blinded to study group assignment recorded the BIS scores continuously on a computer and compared the scores at the following time points: awake, induction of anesthesia, intravenous catheter placement, tracheal intubation, start of surgery, end of surgery, awakening to commands, and tracheal extubation.
No significant differences in BIS scores existed among the study groups at any time point. No significant difference in slope of induction of anesthesia was noted among the study groups. However, the slope of emergence from anesthesia leading to tracheal extubation showed a significantly longer emergence time in the higher MR groups.

The higher the number of samples, the greater is the pain and discomfort. The objective of this study was to compare three anesthetic techniques in this group of patients.
Forty-five patients were included in this study. Patients were divided into three groups: 1 - Propofol; 2 - Propofol + Prostatic Plexus Block; 3 - Propofol + Fentanyl. Patients were monitored with non-invasive blood pressure, continuous electrocardioscopy, pulse oximetry (SpO₂), and Bispectral Index. Patients did not receive pre-anesthetic medication. Intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic parameters, intraoperative bispectral index, and postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) and the use of dypirone to treat postoperative pain were evaluated.
A significant difference among the three groups was not observed for: anthropometric parameters, amount of propofol, number of fragments, and duration of the exam. Hemodynamic parameters and SpO₂ presented similar behavior in all three groups. In group 1, the pain evaluated by the VAS was more severe and required more dypirone than in the other groups.

We aimed to establish whether the duration of preoperative abstinence from fluids independently contributed to arterial blood pressure changes and dosage requirements during propofol induction.
We prospectively recruited 130 ASA I or II nonhypertensive patients, ages 18 to 65 years scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia. Standard physiological and electroencephalographic bispectral index (BIS) monitoring was applied to each patient. Intravenous propofol infusion was commenced at 40 mg · kg(-1) · h(-1) and reduced to 8 mg · kg(-1) · h(-1) when the BIS decreased to 50. Frequent cardiovascular data were collected for 15 minutes. The primary endpoint was maximal percentage decrease from baseline mean arterial blood pressure (max%ΔMAP). The secondary endpoint was the propofol dose at which BIS decreased to 50 (PDBIS50). Univariate linear regression and then multivariate linear regression was used to analyze the associations between potential predictors, including fasting time, and these 2 endpoints.
Mean fluid abstinence time was 694 minutes (range: 115 to 1263 minutes). Unstandardized regression coefficients (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for fluid abstinence (minutes) versus max%ΔMAP (%) and PDBIS50 (mg) were, respectively, 0.003% (-0.002% to + 0.009%) and 0.021 mg (-0.017 mg to + 0.059 mg). On adjusting for other, significant predictors in a multivariate model and applying type II sum of squares tests, the corresponding values were -0.0001% (-0.004% to + 0.004%, P = 0.94) and -0.006 mg (-0.039 mg to + 0.026 mg, P = 0.70). The effect of a 1-hour increase in fluid abstinence on max%ΔMAP was therefore -0.01% (-0.26% to + 0.24%) and on PDBIS50, -0.38 mg (-2.34 mg to + 1.58 mg).

20844378,Does nitrous oxide affect bispectral index and state entropy when added to a propofol versus sevoflurane anesthetic?,Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,2010,"Ozcan MS, Ozcan MD, Khan QS, Thompson DM, Chetty PK","In earlier studies, nitrous oxide (N2O) did not affect bispectral index (BIS) or state entropy (SE) when administered as the sole anesthetic agent. We investigated the effect of adding N2O to sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia on BIS and SE.
A total of 28 patients were randomized to receive general anesthesia using either 2% sevoflurane or 120 mcg/kg/min propofol during surgery. After 20 minutes of stable anesthetic and surgical conditions (baseline), 60% N2O was added for 20 minutes. Another 20 minutes was allowed for washout after N2O was discontinued. Sevoflurane concentration was closely monitored using the standard end-tidal gas analysis and vaporizer output was constantly adjusted to offset the second-gas effect caused by the addition and discontinuation of N2O. Mean values for BIS and SE were calculated for the last 5 minutes of the baseline, nitrous oxide, and washout periods.
In the propofol group, BIS and SE values in baseline versus N2O periods were 40±10 versus 39±10 and 43±11 versus 43±12, respectively (mean±SD, P>0.05). In the sevoflurane group, addition of N2O decreased both BIS (36±7 to 32±7, P<0.001) and SE (37±10 to 31±11, P=0.001). The magnitude of change from the baseline in BIS and SE in the sevoflurane group was 3.6±3.8 (95% CI: 0.8-6.5) and 6.1±5.5 (95% CI: 3.7-8.6), respectively. Average baseline and washout values of BIS and SE were not different in both groups (P>0.05).
N2O decreased both BIS and SE when added to sevoflurane, but not propofol. The observed changes in the sevoflurane group were not clinically significant. Decreases in BIS and SE in the sevoflurane group could result from a true additive effect and second-gas effect of N2O that was unaccounted for despite a meticulous titration of sevoflurane using end-tidal gas monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20844378/

However, the accuracy of the administered concentration of volatile anesthetics was not examined. In the present study we measured the accuracy of the ACD when used as a portable vaporizer.
This prospective study included 30 ASA I-III patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. The patients were randomly organized into 3 groups of 10 patients per group. In each group, the sevoflurane infusion rate was adjusted to deliver 1.0 vol%, 1.5 vol%, and 2.0 vol% alveolar concentration. Hemodynamic data, bispectral index, and end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations were recorded every 2 minutes.
We analyzed 801 data points from 30 patients. The mean difference between the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration and the target concentration was -11.0 ± 9.3% of the target when the target was 1.0 vol%, -5.4 ± 6.4% when the target was 1.5 vol%, and -4.0 ± 7.4% when the target was 2.0 vol%. No significant differences were found in the error at the different target concentrations.
We found that the ACD may be a valid alternative to the conventional vaporizer. The ACD is very simple to use, delivery rate needs to be adjusted only once per hour, and the anesthetic savings are independent of the circuit characteristics and fresh gas flow rate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20841411/

What are the patterns commonly seen during routine clinical anesthesia?
We analyzed pre-frontal EEG data from a previously published study (116 adult patients having general anesthesia maintained with either desflurane or propofol) (Leslie et al. in Anesthesiology 111:547-555, 2009), The EEG was quantified using seven estimated parameters: slope and intercept of the underlying non-oscillatory (logarithmically transformed) power spectrum, amplitude and frequency of the episodic frontal alpha (EFA) oscillation, peak power in the delta waveband, high frequency variability index, and bispectral index (BIS). We compared a 30 s EEG segment from 2 min before, with that 2 min after the surgical incision.
The pre-incision EEGs showed a wide spread of different values for the estimated EEG parameters, but the propofol group had increased EFA amplitude. Incision was associated with decreased EFA activity (p = 0.0004), and high frequency variability (p = 0.04, repeated measures ANOVA). The effects of the incision were independent of the type of drug used for maintenance of anesthesia, and on the pre-incision BIS. The loss of EFA tended to be associated with an increase in delta power (r = -0.39, p < 0.0001).
During anesthesia maintained with desflurane or propofol, surgical incision has modest effects on the EEG patterns. It does not cause an increase in high frequency power; the most consistent changes are a loss of EFA amplitude and burst suppression patterns. This effect is not strongly modified by the depth of anesthesia--as estimated by the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20680669/

Two minutes after i.v. injection of 0.3 mcg.kg(-1) of sufentanil, general anesthesia was induced by an initial bolus of 3 mg.kg(-1) of propofol, followed by a continuous infusion titrated to achieve a stable BIS value of 50 +/- 5. Patients received either mivacurium 0.25 mg.kg(-1) (Group Miva) or NaCl 0.9% 0.12 ml.kg(-1) (Group Control). Mean BIS and CSI values per minute were compared between (Miva vs. Control) and within groups (Baseline vs 5 min. after study drug administration).
The observed changes in BIS and CSI values before and after administration of study drugs revealed no differences between the study groups. Mean baseline BIS and CSI values were lower than 5 min after study drug administration. There were no intergroup differences with respect to BIS and CSI values at any time point.

Point-of-care monitoring can potentially dictate changes to management intraoperatively. In this observational study, we examined the correlation between a series of point-of-care monitors and lactate flux during CEA.
Both neurosurgeons and vascular surgeons participated in the study. The patients underwent arterial-jugular venous blood sampling for oxygen, carbon dioxide, glucose, and lactate, n = 26; bispectral index (BIS) monitoring ipsilateral to side of surgery, n = 26; raw and processed electroencephalogram (EEG), n = 22; and bi-frontal cerebral oximetry using the Fore-Sight monitor, n = 20.
One patient experienced a new neurological deficit when assessed at 24 hr following surgery. Lactate flux into the brain was correlated with the greatest decrease in cerebral oximetry with carotid cross-clamping; lactate efflux was correlated with the least. The most noticeable changes in processed EEG (density spectral analysis) were also seen with lactate influx, but at a slower time resolution than cerebral oximetry. Loss of autoregulatory behaviour was demonstrated with lactate influx; however, no correlation was seen between lactate flux and BIS monitoring.
There was a correlation between cerebral oximetry and lactate flux during carotid cross-clamping. The Fore-Sight monitor may be of value as a point-of-care monitor during CEA under general anesthesia. A novel finding of this study is lactate flux into the brain in the presence of a large difference in cerebral oxygenation during cross-clamping of the carotid artery.

In this article, we review the recent publications in the area of anesthesia awareness and attempt to answer the question: Is awareness a problem without solutions? The incidence of awareness has been reported in benchmark studies to be about 0.1%, but two recent studies in Spain and China have reported incidences of awareness of 1% and 0.4%, respectively. Recent studies have confirmed that awareness is more common in women undergoing cesarean sections (0.26%) and in children (0.5-1%). There are very few trials that provide strong evidence for awareness prevention strategies. The best current evidence from one randomized trial suggests that bispectral index monitoring identifies the presence and reduces the incidence of awareness in high-risk patients. More trials are needed and two large ongoing trials are exploring the value of monitoring end-tidal gas concentrations and maintaining adequate age-adjusted values during surgery as an alternative method to prevent awareness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20661203/

In addition, previous reports suggest that both neurons may have an important role to play in general anesthesia. In the present study, we have determined whether general anesthesia would affect plasma orexin A (OXA) and norepinephrine concentrations. Twelve patients scheduled for elective ophthalmic surgery under general anesthesia with sevoflurane, fentanyl and vecuronium were studied. Arterial blood was collected before and 1 and 2h after induction of anesthesia and at emergence to measure plasma OXA, cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations. During anesthesia the inhalational concentration of sevoflurane was changed to maintain the bispectral index between 40 and 50. Plasma OXA, cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine did not change during anesthesia but significantly increased after emergence compared to pre-anesthesia (from 14.8+/-1.7 to 21.4+/-1.7 pM, p<0.01, from 26.5+/-5.2 to 52.8+/-6.0 pM, p<0.01, from 263+/-46 to 513+/-89 pM, p<0.01, and from 1239+/-120 to 1631+/-203 pM, p<0.01, respectively).

The study population consisted of 30 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II and III, aged 65-77 years, who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were randomly divided into two groups (n = 15 each): a control group, receiving normal saline, and a landiolol group, receiving landiolol at 30 μg/kg/min. After oxygenation, 1 μg/kg of fentanyl was injected intravenously, followed by continuous infusion of normal saline or landiolol for 5 min. General anesthesia was induced and maintained with target-controlled infusion of propofol at a blood concentration of 4 μg/ml and tracheal intubation was performed 3 min after vecuronium injection. Heart rate, blood pressure, and bispectral index were measured before and after tracheal intubation. Results showed that low-dose continuous infusion of landiolol is an effective and relatively safe method of preventing an intubation-induced adrenergic response in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20652333/

20595085,An improved detrended moving-average method for monitoring the depth of anesthesia.,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2010,"Nguyen-Ky T, Wen P, Li Y","The detrended moving-average (DMA) method is a new approach to quantify correlation properties in nonstationary signals with underlying trends. This paper monitored the depth of anesthesia (DoA) using modified DMA (MDMA) method. MDMA provides a power-law relation between the fluctuation function F(MDMA)(s) and the scale s: F(MDMA)(s)αs(α), where α is the slope of F(MDMA)(s) in the logarithm scale. We applied the MDMA to monitor the DoA by computing the scaling exponent F(α) and F(min) values. To validate the proposed method, we compared our results with the bispectral index (BIS) monitor. We found a close correlation between our results and BIS with r(F (min)) = 0.9346, r(2)(F(min)) = 0.9183, and r(F(α)) = 0.9458, r(2)(F(α)) = 0.8855. Our method reflects the state of consciousness of a patient undergoing general anesthesia faster than BIS as observed clinically. The minimum time delay between the BIS and F(min) trends was 12 s and the maximum was 178 s. Furthermore, in the case of poor signal quality, our results agreed with clinical observation, which indicates that our method can accurately estimate a patient's hypnotic state in such circumstances. F(α) and F(min) trends are responsive and their movement seems similar to changes in the clinical state of the patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20595085/

The SNAP II(c) is a single-lead electroencephalogram device that displays a SNAP(c) Index - a derived value based on both high and low frequency electroencephalogram signals. Much of the current clinical research on monitoring during sedation involves the bispectral index monitor. We compared simultaneous readings recorded by the SNAP II and bispectral index during sedation in 51 consecutive patients undergoing surgery.

Data for plasma etomidate concentrations, BIS, and OAA/S were collected every minute and analyzed by NONMEM. A 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model and a pharmacodynamic sigmoid E(max) model fit the data best, with volumes of distribution at central and peripheral compartments of 4.45 and 74.90 L, respectively, and systemic and intercompartmental clearances of 0.63 and 3.16 L/min, respectively. t(1/2)k(e0) was 1.550 min. EC(50) values were 0.526 and 0.554 µg/mL, and gamma values were 2.25 and 6.24 for BIS and OAA/S, respectively. The prediction probability between OAA/S and BIS was 0.8. The slopes of the curves suggest that BIS is a better monitor of depth of sedation and hypnosis, whereas OAA/S may be more useful for monitoring sleep versus wakefulness.

In the current study, we evaluated a closed-loop system - closed-loop anaesthesia delivery system (CLADS) - for postoperative sedation after open heart surgery using BIS.
Forty-one postoperative cardiac surgery patients in the age group 18-65 years were included. In the postanaesthesia care unit, they were randomly allocated to two groups: a CLADS group, which received a continuous infusion of propofol using CLADS, and a manual group, which received propofol at a rate manually adjusted by the clinician. Propofol was administered in both groups to maintain the BIS at a target of 70 for adequate sedation. Patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation and the trachea extubated after confirmation of haemodynamic stability, haemostasis, normothermia and mental orientation.
The percentage of total sedation time during which BIS remained within +/-10 of the target value (BIS of 70 during sedation) was significantly higher in the CLADS group than in the manual group (P = 0.002).

20186436,Effect of remifentanil on cardiovascular and bispectral index responses following the induction of anesthesia with midazolam and subsequent tracheal intubation.,Journal of anesthesia,2010,"Miyake W, Oda Y, Ikeda Y, Tanaka K, Hagihira S, Iwaki H, Asada A","We examined the hypothesis that remifentanil decreases the bispectral index (BIS) as well as blunts cardiovascular responses to tracheal intubation during anesthesia with midazolam.
Sixty patients were randomly allocated to three groups according to the dose of remifentanil-0.1 (S), 0.2 (M), or 0.5 (L) microg kg(-1) min(-1), respectively. Infusion of remifentanil was started 5 min before the induction of general anesthesia with midazolam 0.2 mg/kg in all groups. Following the administration of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg, the trachea was intubated 5 min after induction, and the infusion rate of remifentanil was then reduced to 0.05 microg kg(-1) min(-1) in all groups. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), BIS, and 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) were measured until 10 min after tracheal intubation.
Infusion of remifentanil alone before the induction of anesthesia did not affect the hemodynamic or electroencephalographic parameters. MAP was significantly decreased after induction in all groups of patients (P < 0.01), with no differences among the three groups, while it was significantly increased after tracheal intubation in the patients of groups S and M, but not in those of group L. The HR did not change after induction in any of the groups, but it was also significantly increased after tracheal intubation of group S and M patients, although not in those of group L. The BIS decreased after induction, and both the BIS and SEF95 were significantly lower in group L patients than in those of group S (P < 0.01). All patients were unconscious after induction, and none complained of intraoperative awareness.
In our patient cohort, remifentanil 0.5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) effectively decreased the BIS after the induction of general anesthesia with midazolam 0.2 mg/kg and suppressed the increase of MAP and HR in response to subsequent laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20186436/
20175774,Monitoring sedation in the critically ill child.,Anaesthesia,2010,"Lamas A, López-Herce J","Sedation is an essential part of the management of the critically ill child, and its monitoring must be individualised and continuous in order to adjust drug doses according to the clinical state. There is no ideal method for evaluating sedation in the critically ill child. Haemodynamic variables have not been found to be useful. Clinical scales are useful when sedation is moderate, but are limited by their subjective nature, the use of stimuli, and the impossibility of evaluating profoundly sedated patients or those receiving neuromuscular blocking drugs; in addition, many of these scales have not been evaluated in children. The COMFORT scale is the most appropriate, as it was designed and validated for critically ill children requiring mechanical ventilation. Electroencephalography-derived methods permit continuous monitoring, provide an early indication of changes in the level of sedation, and facilitate a rapid adjustment of medication. However, these methods were designed and validated for patients under anaesthesia and their results cannot be fully extrapolated to the critically ill patient; in addition, some of them have not been validated in small children and there is still little experience in critically ill children. The main indications for the use of these methods are in patients with deep sedation and/or neuromuscular blockade. The bispectral index is the most widely used method at the present time. Analysis and comparison of the efficacy of the different methods for evaluating sedation in the critically ill child is required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20175774/

During out of office hours and weekends, cEEG monitoring is not always available. The Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor can be used to assess the hypnotic component of general anesthesia. We conducted a study to evaluate the feasibility of using the BIS monitoring to assess the burst suppression (BS) pattern during propofol anesthesia in RSE.
Ten adult patients with RSE admitted to the ICU were monitored simultaneously with cEEG and BIS monitoring. We compared the BIS and suppression ratio (SR) values with the EEG burst suppression pattern when the depth of anesthesia was titrated to the BS level monitoring by cEEG.
We found an excellent correlation between the cEEG burst rate per minute and the BIS (r² =-0.9; p< 0.001) and SR (r² = -0.88; p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of BIS score of 30 to detect BS in electroencephalography were 99% and 98%, respectively. The BIS monitor was not able to recognize regional epileptic activity and epileptic bursts during the BS pattern.
The cEEG can be considered as the primary monitoring technique in the assessment of the depth of anesthesia in the treatment of RSE. If cEEG is not available, the BIS monitor can be used to guide the level of anesthesia, targeting BS in patients with RSE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20132290/
20090541,Effectiveness of premedication agents administered prior to nitrous oxide/oxygen.,European journal of anaesthesiology,2010,"Baygin O, Bodur H, Isik B","In paediatric dentistry, when anxiety, fear of dental procedures or behavioural impairment precludes the conduct of dental treatments, sedation procedures are required. However, sedation at the desired level might not be achieved despite administration of various agents. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of oral premedication with different agents on children scheduled for dental treatment under nitrous oxide/oxygen (N2O/O2) sedation.
The present research was approved by the Ethics Committee of Gazi University Faculty of Medicine. Sixty children aged between 5 and 8 years, ASA I or II, having no mental or motor retardation, requiring at least two-visit dental treatment, having no sedation or general anaesthesia experience, and incompliant with dental treatment (Frankl Behaviour Scale>or=3), were enrolled into the study after obtaining informed parental consent. The children were then randomly assigned to one of four groups. The treatment regimen according to the study groups was as follows: oral administration of 1 mg kg(-1) hydroxyzine hydrochloride suspension (Atarax) 1 h preoperatively (group I, n=15), oral administration of 0.7 mg kg(-1) midazolam (Dormicum) 15 min preoperatively (group II, n=15), oral administration of 3 mg kg(-1) ketamine (Ketalar) with 0.25 mg kg(-1) midazolam (Dormicum) 15 min preoperatively (group III, n=15), and no oral premedication administration [group IV (controls), n=15]. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate were monitored with a pulse oximeter during treatment. The sedation level was monitored with the bispectral index. Following premedication, 40% N2O and 60% O2 was administered to all groups by means of a nasal mask. Sedation depth was evaluated using the Ramsay Sedation Scale and data were recorded at 5 min intervals. Sedation success and other sedation-related events were recorded.
The evaluation of the findings of this study revealed that treatment procedures were completed without any serious complications. Achievement of sedation in terms of satisfactory/mid-level satisfactory/unsatisfactory was as follows: 13.3/53.3/33.3% in group I; 54/20/26% in group II; 33.3/33.3/33.3% in group III, and 6.7/60/33.3% in group IV, respectively. Ramsay Sedation Scale results revealed that the most effective medication was 0.7 mg kg(-1) midazolam.
It is concluded that 0.7 mg kg(-1) midazolam is more effective than 0.25 mg kg(-1) midazolam with 3 mg kg(-1) ketamine and 1 mg kg(-1) hydroxyzine hydrochloride in terms of oral premedication prior to N2O/O2 sedation in children scheduled for dental treatments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20090541/

We compared the effects of a dexmedetomidine-bupivacaine mixture with plain bupivacaine for thoracic epidural anaesthesia on intraoperative awareness and analgesic benefits, when combined with superficial isoflurane anaesthesia (<0.05 maximum alveolar concentration) in patients undergoing thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation (OLV).
Fifty adult male patients were randomly assigned to receive either epidural dexmedetomidine 1 microg/kg with bupivacaine 0.5% (group D) or bupivacaine 0.5% alone (group B) after induction of general anaesthesia. Gasometric, haemodynamic and bispectral index values were recorded. Post-operative verbal rating score for pain and observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale were determined by a blinded observer.
Dexmedetomidine reduced the use of supplementary fentanyl during surgery. Patients in group B consumed more analgesics and had higher pain scores after operation than patients of group D. The level of sedation was similar between the two groups in the ICU. Two patients (8%) in group B reported possible intraoperative awareness. There was a limited decrease in PaO2 at OLV in group D compared with group B (P<0.05).
In thoracic surgery with OLV, the use of epidural dexmedetomidine decreases the anaesthetic requirements significantly, prevents awareness during anaesthesia and improves intraoperative oxygenation and post-operative analgesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20085547/

We performed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients (>or=65 years) without preoperative delirium or severe dementia who underwent hip fracture repair under spinal anesthesia with propofol sedation. Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index (BIS), and patients were randomized to receive either deep (BIS, approximately 50) or light (BIS, >or=80) sedation. Postoperative delirium was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition Revised) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery.
From April 2, 2005, through October 30, 2008, a total of 114 patients were randomized. The prevalence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the light sedation group (11/57 [19%] vs 23/57 [40%] in the deep sedation group; P=.02), indicating that 1 incident of delirium will be prevented for every 4.7 patients treated with light sedation. The mean +/- SD number of days of delirium during hospitalization was lower in the light sedation group than in the deep sedation group (0.5+/-1.5 days vs 1.4+/-4.0 days; P=.01).
The use of light propofol sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative delirium by 50% compared with deep sedation. Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple, safe, and cost-effective intervention for preventing postoperative delirium in elderly patients that could be widely and readily adopted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20042557/

This study was undertaken to investigate BIS changes in awake patients with and without neurological deficits during carotid endarterectomy under regional anaesthesia.
Seventy consecutive carotid endarterectomies under regional anaesthesia were divided into two surgical groups: patients with and patients without neurological deficits. Patients' neurological status was evaluated and neurological deficits were compared with BIS values. Measurements were made at different surgical stages: baseline, after sedation, at the beginning of surgery, at preclamping, at the 3 min clamping test, during shunt insertion, at declamping, 15 min after declamping and at the end of surgery. We performed intergroup and intragroup comparisons of BIS values. A decrease in BIS of at least 10 associated with neurological deficits was taken as the cut-off point for the classification of patients with logistic regression models (crude and adjusted for potential confounders).
Thirteen patients (18.6% of the total) developed clinical cerebral ischaemia, though BIS values decreased in 10 of these patients (76.9%). The mean BIS values were 92.5+/-5.6 and 84.7+/-12.3 for patients without and with neurological deficits, respectively (P value<0.05). The odds ratios of a BIS decrease associated with neurological deficits were 8.5 (95% confidence interval 2.1-35.1) and 5.4 (95% confidence interval 1.2-24.3) adjusted for contralateral stenosis.

Anesthetic depth monitors assist anesthesiologists in providing appropriate levels of anesthesia. Index of consciousness monitoring is a recently introduced monitor in the array of anesthesia depth monitors. The objective of this study was to assess the interchangeability of bispectral index, which is already in clinical use and the recently introduced index of consciousness techniques. The other objective was to assess this interchangeability during normotension, hypotension and during pulseless state in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. This study is a prospective observational study, conducted in a tertiary referral hospital.
Fifteen cardiac surgical patients undergoing off pump and conventional coronary artery bypass under cardiopulmonary bypass participated in the study. Bispectral index and index of consciousness monitoring were carried out simultaneously during various stages of consciousness, and assessed for interchangeability. Bland Altman plotting and 'mountain plot' were used to assess the interchangeability. Eleven in the cohort underwent off pump and the rest (n = 4) conventional coronary artery bypass surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass. A set of 887 data were obtained during the study period. The data were classified as those obtained during normotension, hypotension and pulseless state during cardiopulmonary bypass.
732 sets of data were obtained during normotension, 84 during hypotension and 71 during cardiopulmonary bypass. Overall interchangeability was good, suggested by low bias (0.96), high precision (0.54), r value of 0.7 and P value of <0.0001. It was found that the data obtained during normotension was also interchangeable, suggested by low bias (0.8), high precision (0.54) and r value of 0.7. The data obtained during hypotension was not as highly interchangeable as during normotension-bias 0.4, precision 1.66 and r value of 0.7. The analysis of value during cardiopulmonary bypass suggested non interchangeability (bias 3.87, precision 3.05, r value 0.3 and P value = 0.0067.

Patient safety is of greatest concern and is best addressed by appropriate selection of patients, adequate training of personnel and appropriate monitoring of patients. Readings from bispectral index system (BIS) monitors, which use electroencephalographic signals, correlate accurately with depth of sedation during nondissociative general anesthesia of adults and children in the operating room setting. The usefulness of such monitoring as an adjunct to other forms of monitoring of in-office enteral sedation in the dental setting may represent the next important application of this tool, adding a further level of safety for the patient and another level of predictability for the practitioner. This paper reviews the current evidence supporting this new technique, presenting data from 20 procedures in which BIS monitoring during in-office enteral sedation was employed in a community dental practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20003755/

We investigated whether longer times under deep hypnosis as measured by Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring would positively correlate with a greater incidence of EA in the PACU and a greater occurrence of NPOBC in children after discharge.
We enrolled 400 children, 1-12 years old, scheduled for dental procedures under general anesthesia. All children were induced with high concentration sevoflurane, and BIS monitoring was continuous from induction through recovery in the PACU. A BIS reading <45 was considered deep hypnosis. The presence of EA was assessed in the PACU using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale. NPOBC were assessed using the Post-Hospital Behavior Questionnaire, completed by parents 3-5 days postoperatively. Data were analyzed using logistic regression, with a P < 0.05 considered statistically significant.
The incidence of EA was 27% (99/369), and the incidence of NPOBC was 8.8% (28/318). No significant differences in the incidence of EA or NPOBC were seen with respect to length of time under deep hypnosis as measured by a BIS value of <45.

Seven healthy male volunteers were included in a randomized crossover manner. The heart rate (HR), HR variability, arterial oxygen saturation, and bispectral index value were continuously monitored. A mental arithmetic task for 7 minutes was given with or without intravenous sedation with midazolam or propofol. A bispectral index value of 75 to 85 and an Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score of 4 were the targeted sedation level in both groups. HR variability was assessed using the power spectral analysis (low-frequency [LF] and high-frequency [HF] components and LF/HF ratio). The faces anxiety scale was used to grade their stress feelings after each mental arithmetic task.
During the mental arithmetic task with intravenous sedation, no differences were found in the bispectral index values, arterial oxygen saturation, or the results of the mental arithmetic task between the 2 groups. The HR, LF/HF ratio, and normalized unit LF increased, and the normalized unit HF decreased in both groups. However, the percentage of changes in LF/HF ratio, normalized unit LF, and normalized unit HF were smaller in the midazolam group. In addition, the reduction in faces anxiety scale was greater in the midazolam group.
These results suggest that midazolam more effectively suppresses sympathetic nervous activation and reduces subjective stress feelings during a mental arithmetic task than propofol.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19959271/

This study compared hemodynamic changes, bispectral index scores, and postoperative sore throat before and after laryngoscopy between the Macintosh laryngoscope and the airway scope (AWS). Forty patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II), randomly assigned to either the Macintosh group (n=20 each) or AWS group, were enrolled in this study. After induction with fentanyl (0.001 mg/kg), propofol (1.5 mg/kg), and vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg), tracheal intubation was performed. Hemodynamic parameters were compared before and after laryngoscopy. Patients were assessed for postoperative sore throat at 24 hours after extubation. No significant differences in patient characteristics were observed between groups. Significant increases in both systolic blood pressure (P<0.05 vs. baseline) and heart rate (P<0.001 vs. baseline) after laryngoscopy were seen using the Macintosh blade, whereas the AWS provided no increases in either parameter. The AWS also caused a lesser increase in bispectral index (P<0.05 vs. Macintosh group). Postoperative sore throat was observed in both groups (2 out of 20 in AWS and 6 out of 20 in Macintosh), although this difference did not reach statistically significant level (P=0.23). In conclusion, the AWS offers a reduced degree of hemodynamic stimulation compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope, suggesting that tracheal intubation with the AWS is advantageous to prevent hypertension after laryngoscopy in neurosurgical patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19955890/

Thus, we tested the hypothesis that aminophylline delays loss of consciousness (LOC) and speeds recovery of consciousness (ROC) with propofol anesthesia, and that aminophylline increases the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of desflurane.
In this double-blind crossover study, volunteers were randomized to either aminophylline or saline on different days. Aminophylline 6 mg/kg was given IV, followed by 1.5 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) throughout the study day. After 1 h of aminophylline or saline administration, propofol 200 mg was given at a rate of 20 mg/min. The bispectral index was continuously monitored, as were times to LOC and ROC. After recovery from propofol, general anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and subsequently maintained with desflurane. The Dixon ""up-and-down"" method was used to determine MAC in each volunteer after repeated tetanic electrical stimulation.
Eight volunteers completed both study days. Time to LOC was prolonged by aminophylline compared with saline (mean +/- SD) (7.7 +/- 2.03 min vs 5.1 +/- 0.75 s, respectively, P = 0.011).

Timing of eye opening to voice was matched with BIS index of 66.3 +/- 10.4 and occurred 12.7 +/- 8.3 h after passing BIS index of 50.
These results suggest that BIS monitoring is a non-invasive, simple, easy-to-interpret method, which is useful in assessing peritransplant state of consciousness. BIS monitoring may therefore be a useful tool during peritransplant intensive care for patients with FHF showing hepatic encephalopathy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19925461/

Several factors have been found to alter BIS readings without affecting the depth of anesthesia. We conducted a study to assess the impact of changing patients' position on BIS readings.
General anesthesia was administered to 40 patients undergoing minor surgeries. Patients were kept in neutral position (supine) for 15 min and BIS readings, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and end-tidal isoflurane were recorded. Patients were then shifted to head-down position (30 degrees), neutral position, and lastly head-up position (30 degrees) each of 15-min duration and the data were recorded.
There was a significant increase in BIS values in head-down position (median 47 vs 40) compared with neutral position, whereas head-up position significantly decreased BIS (39 vs 41) compared with neutral position (P < 0.05).
Changing a patient's position significantly affects the BIS values, which might affect the interpretation of anesthetic depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19923512/

Dexmedetomidine is a novel sedative, providing sedation while patients remain cooperative and can be easily aroused; as a consequence, BIS used with dexmedetomidine may poorly characterize sedation. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that BIS values are lower with dexmedetomidine than with propofol at comparable Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) scores.
This was a randomized, 2-day, crossover study. On the first study day, healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to either propofol or dexmedetomidine sedation. Drugs were administered using computer-controlled infusions targeting an effect-site concentration of 1, 2, and 4 microg/mL for propofol or a plasma concentration of 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 ng/mL for dexmedetomidine. The relationship between BIS and OAA/S score was obtained 20 and 40 min after changing each drug concentration. BIS values at each OAA/S score were compared between drugs. The cutoff values of BIS for OAA/S score of < or =2 were obtained by analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves.
Nine volunteers were included in our analysis. Heart rates decreased significantly with dexmedetomidine sedation. ETco(2) was significantly increased with high doses of propofol but did not increase with high doses of dexmedetomidine. BIS values at OAA/S scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 during propofol sedation were 95.5 (90-97), 78 (71-84.5), 67 (64-70), 57 (51.5-60), and 34 (30-37), respectively. BIS values at OAA/S scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 during dexmedetomidine sedation were 95 (79-98), 62 (53.5-68.5), 45.5 (45.3-52), 39.5 (34.3-41.8), and 24.5 (22.5-30.5), respectively. BIS values were significantly less with dexmedetomidine than propofol at OAA/S responsiveness scores of 2, 3, and 4. The calculated cutoff BIS values for OAA/S scores of < or =2 were 67 (sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 97%, and area under the curve of 0.98) for propofol and 46 (sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 91%, and area under the curve of 0.96) for dexmedetomidine.

Intraoperative hypotension and organ toxicity might be avoided if lower doses of anesthetics are administered, but whether this translates into a reduction in serious morbidity or mortality remains controversial. The B-Aware Trial randomly allocated 2463 patients at high risk of awareness to BIS-guided anesthesia or routine care. We tested the hypothesis that the risks of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke would be lower in patients allocated to BIS-guided management than in those allocated to routine care.
The medical records of all patients who had not died within 30 days of surgery were reviewed. The date and cause of death and occurrence of MI or stroke were recorded. A telephone interview was then conducted with all surviving patients. The primary end point of the study was survival.
The median follow-up time was 4.1 (range: 0-6.5) years. Five hundred forty-eight patients (22.2%) had died since the index surgery, 220 patients (8.9%) had an MI, and 115 patients (4.7%) had a stroke. The risk of death in BIS patients was not significantly different than in routine care patients (hazard ratio = 0.86 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.72-1.01]; P = 0.07). However, propensity score analysis indicated that the hazard ratio for death in patients who recorded BIS values <40 for >5 min compared with other BIS-monitored patients was 1.41 (95% CI: 1.02-1.95; P = 0.039). In addition, the odds ratios for MI in patients who recorded BIS values <40 for >5 min compared with other BIS-monitored patients was 1.94 (95% CI: 1.12-3.35; P = 0.02) and the odds ratio for stroke was 3.23 (95% CI: 1.29-8.07; P = 0.01).

The hemodynamic and bispectral index responses to a remifentanil bolus in neurosurgical hypertensive patients under target-controlled infusion with propofol and remifentanil are addressed.
Ten healthy patients and 10 patients with diagnosed hypertension under pharmacological treatment were studied. A 2 microg/kg remifentanil bolus was administered to all patients before skin incision under target-controlled infusion with propofol and remifentanil. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and the area under the curve for the bispectral index of the electroencephalogram were analyzed within the groups and compared between them every 30 seconds for two minutes following the bolus.
Two minutes after the remifentanil bolus, remifentanil predicted effect-site concentrations reached maximum values of 8.46+/-0.91 ng/ml and 9.74+/-1.29 ng/ml in the healthy and hypertensive patients, respectively. Both groups showed a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and in the area under the curve for the bispectral index.

Eighty-seven patients who had an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I-III and were scheduled to undergo an elective surgery with general anesthesia were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received auditory stimulation during surgery, whereas the other did not. The auditory stimulation consisted of pure tones presented via headphones. The Bispectral Index level was maintained between 40 and 50 during surgery. To assess learning, patients performed an auditory frequency discrimination task after surgery, and comparisons were made between the groups. General anesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained with a mixture of fentanyl and sevoflurane.
There was no difference in the amount of learning between the two groups (mean +/- SD improvement: stimulated patients 9.2 +/- 11.3 Hz, controls 9.4 +/- 14.1 Hz). There was also no difference in initial thresholds (mean +/- SD initial thresholds: stimulated patients 31.1 +/- 33.4 Hz, controls 28.4 +/- 34.2 Hz). These results suggest that perceptual learning was not induced during anesthesia. No correlation between the bispectral index and the initial level of performance was found (Pearson r = -0.09, P = 0.59).

Receiver-operator characteristic curves and a multiple logistic regression model were constructed to predict good (CPC 1-2, GO) and poor (CPC 3-5, PO) neurological outcomes.
Fourteen patients were excluded from the final analysis; 33 of the remaining 83 patients (40%) were classified as GO. The BIS1 was higher in patients with GO (37 [28-40] vs. 7 [3-15], p < 0.001). BIS1 < 22 predicted PO with a likelihood ratio (LR) of 14.2 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.98, p < 0.001).

Epileptiform electroencephalogram activity, underlying cerebral pathology, or anticonvulsant/spasmolytic therapy might influence BIS monitoring. Our aim in this exploratory study was to first compare BIS values at 4 different stages of anesthesia between intellectually disabled children and controls. Our second aim was to investigate the discriminative properties of BIS between consciousness and unconsciousness for intellectually disabled children and for controls.
Eighteen intellectually disabled children and 35 control children, aged 2-13 yr, were included. BIS values, landmark events, and standard monitoring values of vital functions were recorded throughout the whole procedure. The performance of BIS in distinguishing between a conscious and unconscious state was assessed from receiver operating characteristic curves.
Median (interquartile range) BIS values for the intellectually disabled group were significantly lower than those for controls in the awake state (72 [48-77] vs 97 [84-98], P < 0.001), during stable intraoperative anesthesia (34 [21-45] vs 43 [33-52], P = 0.02), and during return of consciousness (59 [36-68] vs 73 [64-78], P = 0.009). The discriminative properties of the BIS monitor for the state of consciousness were comparable between the 2 groups according to the receiver operating characteristic curves. Nevertheless, the optimal cutoff BIS value for discrimination between conscious and unconscious state was 28 points lower for the intellectually disabled group.
We advise anesthesiologists to be alert to possible lower BIS values in intellectually disabled children. There is a risk that they will inadvertently misinterpret the state of consciousness in intellectually disabled children.

The tentative and controversial findings of a 2006 study suggesting a correlation of mortality with lower intraoperative bispectral index scores were reproduced in a more recent study, but the correlation could be accounted for by controlling for patient comorbidities, particularly malignancy. In a large trial involving patients at high risk for awareness, general anesthesia with volatile agents guided by bispectral index monitoring was associated with a low incidence of awareness, but no more so than the use of alarms for limits on volatile agent concentration. Studies comparing both emerging and more established brain function monitors suggest that, in spite of their different algorithms for processing and filtering electromyographic signal, many monitors are affected by the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Recent evidence is consistent with previous studies that describe a nonlinear model for the dose-response of EEG parameters to increasing concentration of anesthetic agents with a dosing plateau response over a clinically relevant dose range.

With IRB approval and informed consent we analyzed the data of three studies including 61 adult patients scheduled for radical prostatectomies. At least 45 min after induction of general anesthesia, end-tidal concentrations of desflurane, sevoflurane or isoflurane were varied between 0.5 and 2 MAC.

A move away from rigid anesthetic protocols, which were designed to limit drug transmission across the placenta, has reduced the incidence of awareness during cesarean delivery to approximately 0.26%. Nevertheless, it remains an undesirable complication with potential for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder. Assessing depth of anesthesia remains a challenge for the anesthesia provider as clinical signs are unreliable and there is no sensitive and specific monitor. Bispectral Index monitoring with the goal of scores <60 has been recommended to prevent awareness. Induction drugs vary in their ability to produce amnesia and the period of hypnotic effect is affected by the rate at which they are redistributed. After initiation of anesthesia, volatile anesthetics should be administered to a target of 0.7 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration, which has been shown to consistently achieve mean Bispectral Index scores <60. Because of its rapid uptake, nitrous oxide remains an important adjunct to reduce the risk of awareness during emergency cesarean delivery. In the absence of fetal compromise, there is no rationale for an inspired oxygen concentration above 0.33. Deeper levels of anesthesia reduce the incidence of awareness; current evidence does not suggest an increased risk of tocolysis or fetal morbidity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19690262/

Because clinical assessment of depth of sedation is labor-intensive, performed only intermittently, and interferes with sedation and sleep, processed electrophysiological signals from the brain have gained interest as surrogates. We hypothesized that auditory event-related potentials (ERPs), Bispectral Index (BIS), and Entropy can discriminate among clinically relevant sedation levels.
We studied 10 patients after elective thoracic or abdominal surgery with general anesthesia. Electroencephalogram, BIS, state entropy (SE), response entropy (RE), and ERPs were recorded immediately after surgery in the intensive care unit at Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores of -5 (very deep sedation), -4 (deep sedation), -3 to -1 (moderate sedation), and 0 (awake) during decreasing target-controlled sedation with propofol and remifentanil. Reference measurements for baseline levels were performed before or several days after the operation.
At baseline, RASS -5, RASS -4, RASS -3 to -1, and RASS 0, BIS was 94 [4] (median, IQR), 47 [15], 68 [9], 75 [10], and 88 [6]; SE was 87 [3], 46 [10], 60 [22], 74 [21], and 87 [5]; and RE was 97 [4], 48 [9], 71 [25], 81 [18], and 96 [3], respectively (all P < 0.05, Friedman Test). Both BIS and Entropy had high variabilities. When ERP N100 amplitudes were considered alone, ERPs did not differ significantly among sedation levels. Nevertheless, discriminant ERP analysis including two parameters of principal component analysis revealed a prediction probability PK value of 0.89 for differentiating deep sedation, moderate sedation, and awake state. The corresponding PK for RE, SE, and BIS was 0.88, 0.89, and 0.85, respectively.
Neither ERPs nor BIS or Entropy can replace clinical sedation assessment with standard scoring systems. Discrimination among very deep, deep to moderate, and no sedation after general anesthesia can be provided by ERPs and processed electroencephalograms, with similar P(K)s.

19690246,Automated responsiveness monitor to titrate propofol sedation.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2009,"Doufas AG, Morioka N, Mahgoub AN, Bjorksten AR, Shafer SL, Sessler DI","In previous studies, we showed that failure to respond to automated responsiveness monitor (ARM) precedes potentially serious sedation-related adversities associated with loss of responsiveness, and that the ARM was not susceptible to false-positive responses. It remains unknown, however, whether loss and return of response to the ARM occur at similar sedation levels. We hypothesized that loss and return of response to the ARM occur at similar sedation levels in individual subjects, independent of the propofol effect titration scheme.
Twenty-one healthy volunteers aged 20-45 yr underwent propofol sedation using an effect-site target-controlled infusion system and two different dosing protocol schemes. In all, we increased propofol effect-site concentration (Ce) until loss of response to the ARM occurred. Subsequently, the propofol Ce was decreased either by a fixed percentage (20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70%; fixed percentage protocol, n = 10) or by a linear deramping (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 microg x mL(-1) x min(-1); deramping protocol, n = 11) until the ARM response returned. Consequently, the propofol Ce was maintained at the new target for a 6-min interval (Ce plateau) during which arterial samples for propofol determination were obtained, and a clinical assessment of sedation (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation [OAA/S] score) performed. Each participant in the two protocols experienced each percentage or deramping rate of Ce decrease in random order. The assumption of steady state was tested by plotting the limits of agreement between the starting and ending plasma concentration (Cp) at each Ce plateau. The probability of response to the ARM as a function of propofol Ce, Bispectral Index (BIS) of the electroencephalogram, and OAA/S score was estimated, whereas the effect of the protocol type on these estimates was evaluated using the nested model approach (NONMEM). The combined effect of propofol Ce and BIS on the probability for ARM response was also evaluated using a fractional probability model (P(BIS/Ce)).
The measured propofol Cp at the beginning and the end of the Ce plateau was almost identical. The Ce50 of propofol for responding to the ARM was 1.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.55-2.10) microg/mL, whereas the corresponding BIS50 was 75 (71.3-77). The OAA/S50 probability for ARM response was 12.5/20 (12-13.4). A fractional probability (P(BIS/Ce)) model for the combined effect of BIS and Ce fitted the data best, with an estimated contribution for BIS of 63%. Loss and return of ARM response occurred at similar sedation levels in individual subjects.
Reproducible ARM dynamics in individual subjects compares favorably with clinical and electroencephalogram sedation end points and suggests that the ARM could be used as an independent instrumental guide of drug effect during propofol-only sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19690246/

We investigated 64 consecutive patients undergoing gynecological laparotomy under general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia. Midazolam (5 mg) was administered intramuscularly at 15 min before arrival at the operating room. The anesthesiologist informed the patient of the operating room number after evaluating her using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) scale. A BIS probe was then attached to the patient's forehead while she was in the lateral position for epidural puncture. Another anesthesiologist interviewed the patient on the day after surgery and asked her the operating room number and whether there was recall of pain. Group A comprised patients with no recall of the room number and no recall of pain during epidural puncture and group R comprised patients who remembered both the room number and the pain. Patients recalling only the room number or the pain were excluded.
Forty patients were classified as group A and 20 as group R. Four patients remembered only the room number and they were excluded. There were significant differences in body weight, OAA/S scale on arrival at the operating room, and average BIS, and electromyogram (EMG) values during epidural puncture between the two groups. These four parameters were entered into a multiple logistic regression model for multivariate analysis. The analysis identified the BIS value as the only independent predictor of complete amnesia during epidural puncture.
BIS assessment during epidural puncture is informative for the anesthesiologist to predict amnesia following midazolam premedication.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19685110/

The bispectral index (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA) is a monitor of hypnotic state that can help to avoid light hypnosis (i.e., BIS above 60). This study tested the hypothesis that BIS-guided anesthesia maintaining BIS 50-60 reduces the likelihood of memory function under anesthesia.
After obtaining informed consent, 128 patients scheduled for joint replacement surgery under general anesthesia with sevoflurane were randomly assigned to BIS-guided anesthesia, titrating drugs to BIS 50-60 (BIS group), or a standard practice group in which BIS was recorded but did not guide drug administration. After induction, all patients were repeatedly played a list of 15 words. After recovery from anesthesia, all were interviewed about recall and completed a recognition memory test containing the presented words (targets, 33.3%) and new words (distractors). Preoperatively, patients filled out a stress questionnaire (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory).
BIS values above 60 were recorded in both groups, but no patient recalled the presented words postoperatively. Only patients in the BIS group selected targets more often than distractors (37.1% vs. 31.5% hit rate, P = 0.001). Target hit rates correlated poorly to stress scores (P > 0.9), but were associated with the amount of fentanyl received preoperatively (P = 0.01) and pain management technique (P < 0.01).
BIS titration to BIS 50-60 does not necessarily curb memory function under anesthesia when BIS values higher than 60 occur. Preoperative analgesia attenuated the likelihood of memory function under anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19672180/

The electroencephalographic signs of dreaming during anesthesia and the differences between propofol and desflurane also are unknown. The authors therefore compared dream recall after propofol- or desflurane-maintained anesthesia and analyzed electroencephalographic patterns in dreamers and nondreamers and in propofol and desflurane patients for similarities to rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep.
Three hundred patients presenting for noncardiac surgery were randomized to receive propofol- or desflurane-maintained anesthesia. The raw electroencephalogram was recorded from induction until patients were interviewed about dreaming when they became first oriented postoperatively. Using spectral and ordinal methods, the authors quantified the amount of sleep spindle-like activity and high-frequency power in the electroencephalogram.
The incidence of dream recall was similar for propofol (27%) and desflurane (28%) patients. Times to interview were similar (median 20 [range 4-114] vs. 17 [7-86] min; P = 0.1029), but bispectral index values at interview were lower (85 [69-98] vs. 92 [40-98]; P < 0.0001) in propofol than in desflurane patients. During surgery, the raw electroencephalogram of propofol patients showed more and faster spindle activity than in desflurane patients (P < 0.001). The raw electroencephalogram of dreamers showed fewer spindles and more high-frequency power than in nondreamers in the 5 min before interview (P < 0.05).

All currently available monitors need varying time periods to calculate a new index when reacting to changes in anaesthetic depth. The exact time delay for calculation of new index values is unknown. In a previous study, we used simulated EEG signals and found considerable time lags for the cerebral state index (Danmeter, Odense, Denmark), the bispectral index (Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Newton, MA, USA), and the Narcotrend index (MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the time delays observed with simulated EEG signals also applied to real EEG data.
We used perioperatively recorded EEG data from a database corresponding to the awake state, general anaesthesia, and suppression of cortical activity, respectively. After a switch from one state of consciousness to another, the time necessary for all indices to adjust the index value to the underlying input signal was measured.
We found time delays for all indices between 24 (7) and 122 (23) s before the new state was indicated. In accordance with our previous results, these time delays were not constant and depended on the particular starting and target index value. Results were different for decreasing and increasing values.
Our results may show a limitation of the value of electronic EEG indices in prevention of awareness with recall. Furthermore, due to different time delays for ascending and descending values, the results of pharmacodynamic studies may be influenced by this phenomenon.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19648154/

We sought to determine if the use of propofol alone results in less cognitive impairment at discharge than the use of propofol plus midazolam and/or fentanyl in patients presenting for elective outpatient colonoscopy.
Two hundred adult patients presenting for elective outpatient colonoscopy were randomized to receive propofol alone or propofol plus midazolam, and/or fentanyl for IV sedation. Baseline cognitive function was measured using the computerized CogState test battery (Cogstate, Melbourne, Australia) before sedation. During the procedure, sedative drug doses, depth of sedation (via the bispectral index and observer's assessment of alertness/sedation score), complications, and treatability were recorded. Patients were interviewed about recall immediately after emerging from sedation, and cognitive testing was repeated at hospital discharge. Recovery times, quality of recovery, and satisfaction with care were also recorded.
In the propofol plus adjuvants group, 84 patients received fentanyl 50 microg (25-100) (median [range]) and 57 patients received midazolam 2 mg (0.5-10). Patients' cognitive function at discharge was worse than their performance at baseline. However, the changes in cognitive function between discharge and baseline were not significantly different between the two groups. At discharge, 18.5% of patients were cognitively impaired to an extent equivalent to a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.05%. Sedation with propofol plus midazolam and/or fentanyl produced better operating conditions than sedation with propofol alone and was associated with shorter procedure times. Recovery times, recall, dreaming, quality of recovery, and patient satisfaction with care were similar between the groups. Administration of >2 mg of midazolam was a predictor of impaired cognitive function at discharge.
Significant cognitive impairment was common at discharge from elective outpatient colonoscopy. However, the addition of midazolam and/or fentanyl to propofol sedation did not result in more cognitive impairment than the use of propofol alone. Furthermore, the use of adjuvants improved the ease of colonoscopy without increasing the rate of complications or prolonging early recovery times..",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19617584/
19608831,Facial nerve electromyographic monitoring to predict movement in patients titrated to a standard anesthetic depth.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2009,"Jellish WS, Leonetti JP, Buoy CM, Sincacore JM, Sawicki KJ, Macken MP","Facial nerve (FN) monitoring has been accepted as a standard of care in craniofacial, middle ear, and skull-based surgeries as a means of reducing iatrogenic injury, localizing the FN, and predicting postoperative neurologic function. Past studies have also shown that FN electromyographic monitoring (FNEMG) may have some clinical utility as a monitor of anesthetic depth and predicting patient movement. In this study, we evaluated Bispectral Index (BIS) and FNEMG using two different anesthetic techniques to determine whether these monitors can be used to predict movement in patients undergoing skull-based surgical procedures.
Using a single-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial, the relationship between FNEMG monitoring and BIS to predict movement during specific craniofacial and skull-based surgeries performed under general anesthesia was evaluated. In addition, a total IV anesthetic (TIVA) technique, using propofol and remifentanil, was compared with an inhaled anesthetic technique, using desflurane (DES), to determine which regimen provides the best conditions of adequate anesthesia and prevents movement in nonparalyzed patients undergoing a surgical procedure requiring FNEMG monitoring.
The TIVA technique produced better hemodynamic conditions compared with DES. No significant differences were noted in BIS values between the two groups. However, FNEMG activity was lower in the TIVA group during emergence from the effects of anesthesia. More patients moved during anesthesia with DES compared with TIVA, and of the 10 patients who moved, eight had significant FNEMG activity. The positive predictive value of the FNEMG for movement was found to be 38%, and the negative predictive value was 95%. There was no significant change from baseline values in hemodynamics or BIS value for patients who experienced movement compared with those who did not move with FNEMG activity.
This study shows that FNEMG may be an effective monitor for predicting patient movement when undergoing craniofacial and skull-based surgeries. BIS monitoring, however, was not an adequate monitor to predict movement in this patient population. The DES group had more hemodynamic variability and FNEMG activity, whereas TIVA proved to be a more effective anesthetic in preventing patient movement when clinically titrated to produce stable operation conditions. FNEMG was a useful clinical tool to help predict and prevent movement in these patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19608831/

Although studies have consistently demonstrated a faster emergence with desflurane (versus sevoflurane), the impact of this difference on the later recovery end points has not been definitively established. Furthermore, the effect of desflurane (versus sevoflurane) on the incidence of coughing is also controversial.
We randomized 130 outpatients undergoing superficial surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia to one of two maintenance anesthetic treatment groups. All patients were induced with propofol, 2 mg/kg IV, and after placement of a laryngeal mask airway, anesthesia was maintained with either sevoflurane 1%-3% or desflurane 3%-8% in an air/oxygen mixture. The inspired concentration of the volatile anesthetic was varied to maintain hemodynamic stability and a Bispectral Index value of 50-60. Analgesia was provided with local anesthetic infiltration and ketorolac (30 mg IV). Antiemetic prophylaxis consisted of a combination of ondansetron (4 mg), dexamethasone (4 mg), and metoclopramide (10 mg) at the end of surgery. Assessments included recovery times to eye opening, response to commands, orientation, fast-track score of 14, first oral intake, sitting, standing, ambulating unassisted, and actual discharge. Patient satisfaction with anesthesia, the ability to resume normal activities on the first postoperative day, adverse side effects (e.g., coughing, purposeful movement, oxygen desaturation <90%, sore throat, postoperative nausea, and vomiting), and the requirement for postoperative analgesic and antiemetic drugs were recorded in the early postoperative period and during the initial 24-h period after discharge.
The two study groups had comparable demographic characteristics. Although the overall incidence of coughing during the perioperative period was higher in the desflurane group (60% versus 32% in the sevoflurane group, P < 0.05), the incidences of coughing during the actual administration of the volatile anesthetics (i.e., the maintenance period) did not differ between the two groups. Emergence from anesthesia was more rapid after desflurane; however, all patients achieved fast-track recovery criteria (fast-track score >or=12) before leaving the operating room. Finally, the time to discharge home (90 +/- 31 min in sevoflurane and 98 +/- 35 min in desflurane, respectively) and the percentage of patients able to resume normal activities on the first postoperative day (sevoflurane 48% and desflurane 60%) did not differ significantly between the two anesthetic groups.
Use of desflurane for maintenance of anesthesia was associated with a faster emergence and a higher incidence of coughing. Despite the faster initial recovery with desflurane, no significant differences were found between the two volatile anesthetics in the later recovery period. Both volatile anesthetics should be available for ambulatory anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19608808/

In situations such as deep sedation/analgesia, the Bispectral Index (BIS) has potential use as an adjunct to clinical assessment of sedation to help determine depth of sedation. Determining the correlation between clinical and BIS measures of sedation will help to determine the correct role of BIS in intensive care unit (ICU) practice settings.
To evaluate the correlation between the clinical assessment of sedation using the Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) and the assessment using BIS in ventilated and sedated ICU patients.
ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation and sedation were monitored using the SAS and BIS. Nurses initiated event markers with BIS at the time of SAS assessment but were blinded to BIS scores.
Data were collected on 40 subjects generating 209 paired readings. Moderate positive correlation between BIS and SAS values was shown with a Spearman Rank coefficient r value of .502 and an r(2) of .252 (P < .0001). Wide ranges of BIS scores were observed, especially in very sedated patients. Strong positive correlation was noted between BIS and electromyography with an r value of .749 (P < .0001). Age and gender significantly influenced BIS/SAS correlations.
In situations in which the clinical assessment is equivocal, BIS monitoring may have an adjunctive role in sedation assessment. BIS values should be interpreted with caution, however, because electromyography activity and other factors seem to confound BIS scores.

This study assessed how this increase in collapsibility evolves during slow Propofol induction and how it relates to anesthesia-induced changes in upper airway muscle activity and conscious state.
Nine healthy volunteers were studied. Anesthesia was induced with Propofol in a step-wise manner (effect-site concentration steps of 0.5 microg x ml(-1) from 0 to 3 microg x ml(-1) and thereafter to 4 microg x ml(-1) and 6 microg x ml(-1) [target-controlled infusion]). Airway patency was maintained with continuous positive airway pressure. Pharyngeal collapsibility was assessed at each concentration by measuring critical pressure. Intramuscular genioglossus electromyogram and anesthetic depth (bispectral index score) were monitored throughout. Loss of consciousness was defined as failure to respond to loud verbal command.
Loss of consciousness occurred at varying Propofol effect-site concentrations between 1.5 and 4.0 microg x ml(-1). Initially genioglossus electromyographic activity was sustained with increases in Propofol concentration, increasing in some individuals. At or approaching loss of consciousness, it decreased, often abruptly, to minimal values with an accompanying increase in critical pressure. In most subjects, bispectral index score decreased alinearly with increasing Propofol concentration with greatest rate of change coinciding with loss of consciousness.
Slow stepwise induction of Propofol anesthesia is associated with an alinear increase in upper airway collapsibility. Disproportionate decreases in genioglossus electromyogram activity and increases in pharyngeal critical closing pressure were observed proximate to loss of consciousness, suggesting that particular vulnerability exists after transition from conscious to unconscious sedation. Such changes may have parallels with upper airway behavior at sleep onset.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19512872/

Before intubation, Ce of propofol was (2.8 +/- 0.2) microg/ml, (2.8 +/- 0.3) microg/ml, (2.7 +/- 0.3) microg/ml, and the BIS values were 48 +/- 7, 51 +/- 7, and 47 +/- 5 in Groups S1, S2 and S3. By linear regression analysis, a significant correlation between Ce of propofol and BIS values was found (r = -0.580, P < 0.01). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) before intubation was significantly lower in Group S1 than in Groups S2 and S3. SBP and HR after intubation in the three groups were significantly increased when compared with pre-intubation values, but they did not exceed baseline values.
During the TCI induction, Ce of propofol with (1.9 +/- 0.3) microg/ml may make the elderly patients unconscious. When remifentanil with a Ce of 4.0 ng/ml is added a Ce of propofol with (2.8 +/- 0.3) microg/ml is suitable for intubation. The Ce of propofol has a close correlation with the BIS values. Also, a two-step TCI technique seems to be a more suitable method of anesthesia induction in elderly patients compared with the no-stepwise TCI technique and three-step TCI technique.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19493418/

In this study, we evaluated the effects of systemic administration of lidocaine on postoperative pain and morphine requirements after propofol-remifentanil-based anaesthesia.
Forty patients undergoing thoracic surgery were randomly assigned to lidocaine (33.0 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) and physiological saline control groups in propofol-remifentanil-based anaesthesia. The setting of the plasma concentration (C(p)) of the target-controlled infusion of propofol was adjusted according to the bispectral index of the electroencephalogram and blood pressure. The C(p) and effect-site concentration (C(e)) of propofol were calculated by target-controlled infusion pump during the intraoperative period. Pain scoring includes a four-point verbal rating scale, Riker's sedation-agitation scale and a visual analogue scale; the morphine requirement in the postanaesthesia care unit and the morphine consumption via a patient-controlled analgesia device on the ward were recorded during the postoperative period.
Morphine requirements within 30, 30-60 and 0-120 min in the postanaesthesia care unit of the lidocaine group decreased significantly (P < 0.05, n = 20 per group) compared with that of the control group. The four-point verbal rating scale at 30 min in the postanaesthesia care unit, visual analogue scale at 6 h on coughing and patient-controlled analgesia morphine consumption during 2-6 h postoperative time were also significantly (P < 0.05, n = 20 per group) reduced in the lidocaine group. In addition, the intraoperative propofol C(e) in the lidocaine group during the periods of intubation, organ resection, closing of chest cavity and extubation was significantly lower (P < 0.05, n = 20 per group) than that in the control group under the same hypnotic depth.
Systemic administration of lidocaine could reduce morphine requirements, postoperative pain and intraoperative propofol C(e) of patients undergoing thoracic surgery after propofol-remifentanil-based anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19478674/

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate electrical skin impedance in comparison with bispectral index values and the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS) scale during propofol infusion.
Electrical skin impedance was measured with an electrosympathicograph. In 22 patients and eight healthy volunteers, anaesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol that was administered via a target-controlled infusion pump at increasing plasma concentrations. Bispectral index, electrosympathicograph and OAAS values were compared at six successive predicted target plasma concentrations (T 1-6: 0, 1.3, 1.7, 2.0, 2.4 and 2.8 microg ml(-1)).
The changes in the electrical skin impedance measured with the assistance of the electrosympathicograph correlated with the changes in bispectral index values at each measurement time point and during the whole course (P < 0.0001), with the target plasma propofol concentrations (P < 0.0001), and with the OAAS scale (P < 0.0001).

However, intraoperative data are lacking on the effect of different epidurally administered concentrations of local anesthetics on inhaled anesthetic, fluid and vasopressor requirement, and hemodynamic changes. We performed this study among patients undergoing major upper abdominal surgery under combined TEA and general anesthesia.
Forty-five patients undergoing major upper abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups receiving intraoperative TEA with either 10 mL of 0.5% (Group 1) or 0.2% (Group 2) ropivacaine (both with 0.5 microg/mL sufentanil supplement), or 10 mL saline (Group 3) every 60 min. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane in nitrous oxide (60%) initiated at an age-adapted 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) until incision. Desflurane administration was then titrated to maintain an anesthetic level between 50 and 55, as assessed by continuous Bispectral Index monitoring and the common clinical signs (PRST score). Lack of intraoperative analgesia, as defined by an increase in pulse rate, sweating, and tearing (PRST) score >2 or an increase of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) >20% of baseline, was treated by readjusting the end-tidal concentration of desflurane toward 1 MAC, and above this level by additional rescue i.v. remifentanil infusion. Hypotension, as defined as a decrease in MAP >20% of baseline, was treated by reducing the end-tidal desflurane concentration to a Bispectral Index level of 50-55 and below that with crystalloid or norepinephrine infusion, depending on central venous pressure.
End-tidal desflurane concentration could be significantly reduced in Group 1 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 MAC (P < 0.001) and to 0.8 +/- 0.1 MAC (P < 0.001) in Group 2, but not in Group 3. Significant hypotension occurred within 20 min in all patients of Groups 1 and 2 (MAP from 80 +/- 10 to 56 +/- 5) (Group 1), 78 +/- 18 to 58 +/- 7 mm Hg (Group 2), P < 0.01, whereas MAP remained unchanged in Group 3 (74 +/- 12 to 83 +/- 15 mm Hg, P = 0.42). Heart rate did not change significantly over time within any of the groups. Furthermore, groups did not differ significantly regarding i.v. fluid and norepinephrine requirement. Patients in Group 3 received more remifentanil throughout the surgical procedure (7.2 +/- 4.9 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) when compared with Group 2 (1.6 +/- 2.2 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)), P < 0.01. Remifentanil infusion among patients receiving ropivacaine 0.5% was not necessary at any time.
Epidural administration of 0.5% ropivacaine leads to a more pronounced sparing effect on desflurane concentration for an adequate anesthetic depth when compared with a 0.2% concentration of ropivacaine at comparable levels of vasopressor support and i.v. fluid requirement.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19448234/
19448208,Same-patient reproducibility of state entropy: a comparison of simultaneous bilateral measurements during general anesthesia.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2009,"Ozcan MS, Thompson DM, Cure J, Hine JR, Roberts PR","State Entropy (SE) is an index of anesthetic depth similar to Bispectral Index (BIS). Both indices use a single-channel electroencephalogram, recorded from a unilaterally applied electrode on the forehead, as their input. Intrapatient reproducibility of BIS was questioned in a recent study in which simultaneous measurements from two electrodes applied to the same patient showed conflicting anesthetic depths. Our purpose was to determine whether SE results are similarly reproducible, even though their computation uses a different algorithm than BIS. In this study, we investigated the reproducibility of SE measurements simultaneously obtained from bilaterally applied electrodes in the same patient.
Entropy electrodes were applied bilaterally on 21 patients under general inhaled anesthesia. Simultaneous SE measurements from both electrodes were recorded every 10 s from each patient. Data were analyzed with Bland-Altman statistics.
We obtained 14,379 pairs of SE measurements. Four percent of the individual measurements suggested conflicting anesthetic depth along with a numeric difference more than 10 points. Bias was not clinically significant (-0.3). Ninety-five percent limits of agreement were -11.7 and +11.6.
SE showed a clinically significant degree of disagreement when probes were applied on both sides of the forehead in the same patient. Bland-Altman statistics showed better same-patient reproducibility in SE than did a similar study on BIS. Nevertheless, 4% of the simultaneously measured pairs of SE suggested different anesthetic depths and differed by more than 10 points. Caution is advised when using SE as a clinical index of anesthetic depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19448208/

Patients, aged >18 yrs, were randomised to receive midazolam or propofol, given by non-anaesthetist physicians to achieve moderate levels of sedation as assessed by the electroencephalographic bispectral index (BIS; between 70 and 85). The primary end-point was the time delay until recovery of the BIS above 90. Other end-points included a neuropsychometric continuous performance test (CPT), serious respiratory adverse events, patient tolerance and physician satisfaction. Neuropsychometric recovery was improved in the propofol compared to the midazolam group as evidenced by faster normalisation of BIS index (5.4+/-4.7 min versus 11.7+/-10.2 min; p = 0.001) and better results at the CPT. In the midazolam group, 15% of patients presented profound sedation precluding CPT completion and one patient required mechanical ventilatory support. Patient tolerance was significantly better in the propofol group, whereas the operator's assessment was comparable in both groups. Compared with midazolam, propofol provided a higher quality of sedation in terms of neuropsychometric recovery and patient tolerance. BIS-guided propofol administration represents a safe sedation technique that can be performed by the non-anaesthesiologist.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19443532/

19438408,Comparison of postoperative pain outcomes after vertical or Pfannenstiel incision for major gynecologic surgery.,Current medical research and opinion,2009,"Habib AS, Wahl K, Gu J, Gan TJ, ","The Pfannenstiel incision is commonly used for gynecologic surgery. It is not known if this incision is associated with less postoperative pain compared to a vertical midline incision. Therefore, as part of a study to evaluate the postoperative analgesic effects and dose response of intravenous adenosine in patients undergoing open abdominal gynecologic surgery, this manuscript compares postoperative pain and analgesic consumption in patients who had a midline vertical incision or a Pfannenstiel incision.
This is a secondary analysis of data from a primary study investigating the dose response of IV adenosine for postoperative analgesia. Women scheduled for elective major gynecologic surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of intraoperative adenosine infusion (25, 50, 100, or 200 microg/kg/min) or matching placebo (normal saline). The anesthetic technique was standardized and adjusted based on hemodynamic and depth of anesthesia (bispectral index) values. Postoperative analgesia was provided with a standardized morphine patient controlled analgesia protocol which included rescue ketorolac, as needed. Comparative outcome analysis of the midline and Pfannenstiel skin incisions with regards to analgesic consumption and pain scores was performed and presented in this manuscript.
A total of 165 patients were identified; 105 women had a Pfannenstiel incision and 60 had the lower midline abdominal incision. There were no differences between the midline and Pfannenstiel groups with respect to intraoperative fentanyl, postoperative pain scores [worst pain scores 0-24 h (mean +/- SD) 8.2 +/- 2.1 vs. 8.2 +/- 1.9), p = 0.352], cumulative opioid consumption [0-24 h morphine equivalents (mean +/- SD) 63 +/- 27 vs. 72 +/- 43 mg, p = 0.496], or need for rescue ketorolac. While the duration of surgery was longer in patients who had a vertical incision (p = 0.02), there was no difference between the groups in the duration of postanesthesia care unit (44 +/- 53 vs. 30 +/- 45 min, p = 0.093) or hospital stays (74 +/- 27 vs. 67 +/- 20 h, p = 0.254).
There was no significant difference in postoperative pain and opioid consumption in patients undergoing major abdominal gynecologic surgery performed with either a midline or Pfannenstiel incision. However, it is important to note that since this a secondary analysis of data from a primary study investigating the dose response of IV adenosine, the patients were not prospectively randomized into the two incision types.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19438408/

The parameters of the bispectral index and middle latency auditory-evoked potentials studied were the signal quality index, suppression ratio, total power, spectral edge frequency, electromyographic activity, and suppression ratio. Suppression rates were higher in children younger than 1 month than in older children and were also higher in deep sedation. Total power and spectral edge frequency increased with age. Electromyographic activity was higher in moderate sedation. Spectral edge frequency and suppression rates change with age and level of sedation. These variations are a consequence of the electroencephalographic structure at young ages and are secondary to the higher proportion of slow waves in deep states of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19417687/

The pharmacokinetic models focused on incorporating covariate, especially age for pediatric-geriatric use, and altered physiological states. The pharmacodynamic models studied the effect of rate of anesthetic administration, age, experimental conditions, and delay within the monitor on estimation of drug concentration in the biophase. Models for the surrogate measure of the components of general anesthesia, hypnosis (bispectral index scale, entropy), immobility (limb tetanic stimulus-induced withdrawal reflex) and antinociception (surgical stress index, skin conductance algesimeter) were developed and validated. Response surface models were used to study drug interactions for important end-points during surgery and also to optimize dosing of anesthetic agents to maximize the desired/undesired effect ratio. The models for target-controlled infusions were improved by incorporating more covariates, and the closed-loop system was refined by using adaptive controllers that individualize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters to the particular patient by using Bayesian, Kalman filters, fuzzy logic or neural networks.
Progress was made by improving population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models, developing new indexes to measure drug effect and using them in an adaptive delivery system to the individual patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19412091/

Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated the technique's safety or efficacy. Given its popularity, an easily administered rescue strategy is needed.
The authors conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial to investigate how intraoral submucosal flumazenil (0.2 milligram) attenuates central nervous system depression produced by incremental SL dosing of triazolam (three doses of 0.25 mg across 90 minutes) in 14 adults. The authors assessed outcomes by using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale, bispectral index (BIS) and physiological monitoring.
The OAA/S and BIS scores increased after the flumazenil injection at the 30-minute observation point, but they were not sustained. Six hours after the initial dose of triazolam had been administered (four hours after the flumazenil or placebo challenge), all patients could be discharged from the dental clinic.
Deep sedation from incremental SL dosing of triazolam is incompletely reversed by a single intraoral injection of flumazenil. The reversal did not persist. The authors discharged the patients from the dental clinic at 360 minutes.
A single intraoral injection of flumazenil (0.2 mg) cannot immediately reverse oversedation with triazolam. A higher dose might be effective. Reversal for the purpose of discharging the patient early is neither appropriate nor safe.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19411525/

A Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) was placed and scores were recorded every 5 minutes during the procedure to control for different sedation patterns between different endoscopists. The recovery area nurse was unaware of whether a given patient was in the aroma or plain oxygen group, and based each patient's discharge on preexisting standardized criteria.
Two hundred and eighty-four (284) patients completed the study. Both the procedure times and the recovery times were not statistically significant between the two groups. The doses of sedatives used, BIS scores at 5 minute intervals, and rate of change in BIS scores were also not statistically significant between the two groups.

It was obtained from the algorithm based on the analysis of a large number of EEGs from volunteers and patients undergoing sedation and general anesthesia with different anesthetic agents. The use of BIS to monitor the depth of anesthesia reduces the incidence of intraoperative awakening and recall, among other benefits. The objective of this review was to present clinical situations in which the BIS gives false results, either elevated or decreased, due to conditions related to the patient or anesthetic actions unforeseen when the algorithm was elaborated.
The bispectral index can be altered and influenced in different clinical situations in which abnormal EEG patterns are present; the effects of different anesthetics and other drugs not included when the algorithm was elaborated; interference from electrical equipment; as well as peculiarities of the monitor.
Although the BIS algorithm underwent several changes since its first version, the anesthesiologist should be aware of situations that cause false BIS readings to avoid complications, may it be secondary to anesthetic overdose or underdosing, which might cause intraoperative awakening and recall.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19374221/

In a randomized, double-blind study, effects of clonidine (150 microg orally), midazolam (7.5 mg orally) and placebo administered 60-90 min prior to estimated anaesthesia induction time were investigated in 60 healthy ASA I or II patients. All patients received dipotassiumchlorazepate the evening before surgery. At predefined time points, effects of premedication on bispectral index, sedation score and visual analogue scales for anxiety and pain, cognitive function and stress hormones were determined.
Administration of low-dose clonidine was associated with slightly lower bispectral index scores than a standard dose of midazolam or placebo. There were no significant differences in sedation score, visual analogue scale for anxiety and pain and cognitive function between treatment regimens. Clonidine, but not midazolam, reduced anaesthetic requirements for induction of anaesthesia and prevented an increase in heart rate as well as an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone plasma levels during the preoperative period (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). Clonidine administration did not delay postoperative recovery.
Clonidine augmented haemodynamic stability and partially blunted stress responses as determined by adrenocorticotropic hormone plasma levels. In addition, clonidine did not delay postoperative recovery. Therefore, surrogate parameters indicate that preanaesthetic medication with clonidine may be superior to midazolam in healthy individuals.

This prospective, descriptive study performed repeated measures using within-subject and crossover techniques. Forty-eight sedated, ventilated cardiac surgery patients from 2 institutions were included. Pupil sizes, heart rate, blood pressure, cortical arousal changes per the bispectral index, and behaviors were recorded at baseline, during, and after a noxious procedure (endotracheal suctioning or turning), and gentle touch.
The majority of patients was deeply sedated with propofol infusion and were unresponsive or responsive only to physical stimulation. Significant changes in heart rate, pupil size, and bispectral index occurred with the noxious procedure but not with the nonnoxious procedure (P < .01). Reflexive behaviors were not evident during both procedures.

Thirty adult patients undergoing spine surgery were randomized to receive halothane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane, in 2 stages, (a) with air/oxygen mixture (2:1) and (b) in nitrous oxide/oxygen (2:1). Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, response entropy (RE), and state entropy (SE) were noted at 1.0 and 1.5 MACs for each agent. Statistical analysis was done using the 2-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni correction and Student t test for paired data. P value of less than 0.05 were considered significant. The demographics and baseline values of heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, RE, and SE were comparable. Changing from air/oxygen as carrier gas to 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen resulted in significant increase in both RE and SE at 1.0 MAC for all the agents (P<0.05). Among the agents, it was found that both RE and SE values were significantly higher during halothane anesthesia as compared with sevoflurane and isoflurane (P<0.05). At 1.5 MAC for all agents, after addition of nitrous oxide, there was an insignificant reduction in both RE and SE (P>0.05).

Many critically ill patients are given sedatives and paralytics to facilitate aeromedical transport. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is a computer-derived electroencephalography (EEG) analog currently used to monitor the level of awareness of sedated patients. It gives a score of 1-100, with 1 representing no brain function and 100 representing a completely alert patient. Objective. To evaluate whether critically ill patients are adequately sedated during aeromedical transport. Methods. This was a prospective, observational study of a convenience sample of critically ill patients transported by helicopter. All intubated patients who received sedatives and/or paralytics to facilitate transport were eligible for enrollment by the attending clinician. Prior to liftoff, a BIS sensor was applied to the patient's forehead. Minimum, maximum, and mean BIS index scores were recorded every minute during transport. Results. Forty-seven patients (57% male) were enrolled, with a median age of 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 18-81, range 14 to 86 years). The median duration of monitoring was 15.0- minutes (IQR 6.0-26.0, range 2 to 33). The median BIS score was 54.6 (IQR 38.6-67.3, range 28 to 89.5). Only two patients (4.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5% to 14.8%) had at least one BIS score greater than 85, the accepted threshold for recall. Conclusion.

The patients' cognitive function was assessed, using the Hasegawa dementia score (HDS) and kana-hiroi test, on the day before surgery and then again 1 week after the surgery. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) was continuously monitored during the surgery, using near-infrared spectroscopy (INVOS 3100). General anesthesia was induced with 3 mg x kg(-1) thiopental and 5% sevoflurane. After tracheal intubation, the sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to maintain the bispectral index (BIS) value between 45 and 60. Postoperative delirium was diagnosed if DSM IV criteria were present and the patient scored 12 or more points on the Delirium Rating Scale.
After surgery, 5 (25%) patients developed delirium. The age in the delirium (+) group (76 +/- 4 years) was significantly higher than that in delirium (-) group (68 +/- 3 years). Preoperative and postoperative HDS did not differ between the groups. The score on the preoperative kana-hiroi-test in the delirium (+) group (16 +/- 5) was significantly lower than that in the delirium (-) group (32 +/- 10). There were no significant differences between preoperative and postoperative kana-hiroi test scores in either group. Baseline rSO2 in the delirium (+) group (60 +/- 5%) was significantly lower than that in the delirium (-) group (66 +/- 7%). However, there were no significant differences between the groups in the rSO2 after the start of surgery.
Patients' age, low preoperative kana-hiroi test score, and low preoperative rSO2 were important risk factors for postoperative delirium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19234823/
19234818,Auditory evoked potentials index versus bispectral index during propofol sedation in spinal anesthesia.,Journal of anesthesia,2009,Nishiyama T,"It is still controversial whether an electroencephalogram could be a useful monitor of sedation levels. The present study was performed to compare the bispectral index (BIS) and the auditory evoked potentials index (AAI) during light sedation with propofol infusion in spinal anesthesia.
Eighty patients, aged 20 to 70 years, scheduled for surgery of the lower extremities under spinal anesthesia were assigned to one of four groups (20 patients each). Patients in the AAI propofol and BIS propofol groups were sedated with propofol infusion at an initial rate of 2 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1). Propofol infusion was controlled to try to keep the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAAS) scale at 3 or 4. Patients in the AAI control and BIS control groups did not receive propofol.
The OAAS scales and the AAI or BIS decreased significantly in all groups during surgery, while the decrease was larger in the AAI propofol and BIS propofol groups. The AAI was significantly lower along with lower OAAS scales. There was no overlap in the AAI between OAAS scale 3 and scale 5 in the AAI propofol group, while in the BIS propofol group, no difference was observed in the BIS among OAAS scales 2, 3, 4, and 5.
The AAI, but not the BIS, could discriminate slight changes of consciousness during light sedation with propofol infusion in patients with spinal anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19234818/

Prospective, single-centre, unblinded, observational cohort study in an 18 bed general ICU in a tertiary teaching hospital. 45 consecutive comatose patients admitted after CA and treated with TH were included. All patients were sedated with a standardised protocol including neuromuscular blockade. Induced TH was started as soon as possible after arrival in the hospital and continued for 24h before slow rewarming. Sedation was stopped after reaching normothermia (36 degrees C). All patients benefited from maximal supportive intensive care and no therapeutic withdrawal or withholding was done unless bad neurological status was confirmed. Continuous BIS monitoring was performed over 72h in all patients.
14 patients presented BIS values of zero (0) during their ICU stay. At 6 months 11 patients were dead, 1 remained comatose and 2 had severe neurological sequelae (CPC3). No patient of this group had good neurological outcome or improved his neurological outcome between ICU and 6-month follow-up. 31 patients had BIS values higher than 0. At 6 months of those, 11 died, none remained comatose, 3 had bad neurological outcome (CPC3) and 17 had no or minor neurological sequelae (CPC1-2). Thus no correlation between good outcome and BIS values higher than 0 is possible.

A total of 115 consecutive patients (ASA I-IV), receiving low-dose midazolam and propofol sedation for colonoscopy, were evaluated. BIS and AAI levels, Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scores, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, as well as the presence or absence of eyelash reflex, patient reaction to an external noxious stimulus and to procedure-related pain were recorded every 1-3 min by a single trained observer.
There was a positive correlation between BIS and OAA/S scores (correlation coefficient=0.77) and to a lesser extent AAI and OAA/S scores (correlation coefficient=0.47). BIS and AAI showed significant differences between subsequent levels of sedation (P<0.001). The clustered receiver operating characteristic curve estimate of BIS for the detection of deep sedation was significantly better than that of AAI (P<0.001). Regarding the presence or absence of eyelash reflex and patient reaction to an external noxious stimulus and to procedure-related pain, significant different levels were found for BIS as well as AAI, respectively. Only small changes were observed in hemodynamic variables and oxygen saturation. Overall, our data suggest target BIS levels of slightly above 73 for moderate sedation (defined as OAA/S scores 2 and 3).
BIS and AAI correlated with the level of sedation. Hemodynamic variables were poor indicators of the hypnotic-anesthetic status of the patient.

The monitors of depth of anesthesia, based on the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), have been progressively introduced into the daily practice to provide additional information about the state of the patient. In this work, the Index of Consciousness (IoC), a recent index which uses the information from EEG spectrum and symbolic dynamics through a fuzzy inference system, is introduced. The bispectral index BIS, a well-established index, is used to validate the IoC. A good correlation is found between both indexes. Furthermore, IoC presents a significantly higher prediction probability Pk of the level of sedation than BIS, and can thus be considered as an interesting measure of the level of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19163975/

In this situation continuous EEG offers a convenient, effective method of monitoring the depth of sedation, using spectral edge frequency (SEF) to quantify EEG activity. The authors report 3 patients with severe Guillain-Barré syndrome managed with sedation aimed at a SEF95 below 4.0 Hz (delta coma), using a subhairline montage with the DATEX bedside EEG module. Two of the patients were easily managed using this system for an average of 16 days, and both were completely amnestic of this period of time with no serious complication. The third one had still some residual muscle activity and SEF was unreliable in this case, so its use was abandoned. Continuous EEG monitoring using SEF is a useful tool to manage sedation in the most severely paralyzed Guillain-Barré syndrome patients. Incorporation of a low-pass filter would be of benefit to remove any residual muscle activity, which confounds the target level of sedation with this method; SEF has theoretical advantages over the bispectral index in this population.

Five medical centers enrolled 405 ASA physical status I and II unpremedicated Chinese patients (97 men, 308 women) aged 18-65 yr. Propofol was initially given to a predicted blood concentration of 1.2 microg/mL and thereafter increased by 0.3 microg/mL every 30 s until Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score was 1.

However, there are suggestions that EEG derived anesthesia depth monitors have inferior performance in infants. The aim of this study was to quantify the degree of sedation during spinal anesthesia in infants using another EEG derived measure of anesthesia effect--the Cerebral State Index (CSI).
Twelve infants, <52 weeks postconceptual menstrual age, scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair under spinal anesthesia were enrolled. Patients received a standard anesthetic protocol with a subarachnoid dose of 1 mg x kg(-1) of levobupivacaine 0.5%. No premedication, sedatives, opioids or anticholinergics were administrated during the perioperative period and patients were left undisturbed during the surgical time, without tactile stimulation or loud auditory stimuli. CSI score (0-100) and bust suppression (BS) (0-100%) were continuously recorded during the surgical time and then statistically re-evaluated.
In all patients the CSI fell during the procedure and there were significant levels of BS recorded by the CSI monitor. The BS occurred between 12 and 34 min after spinal anesthesia with the peak being at 30 min and mean onset time being 15 (2.6) min after spinal block. A statistical significant difference was found between the lowest mean CSI as well as the highest BS if compared with their baseline values. A negative correlation was found between CSI and BS.
The degree of burst suppression detected by the CSI in our study supports the hypothesis that infants may have discontinuous patterns of EEG during spinal anesthesia similar to those seen during emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, the limitations in the application of the adult algorithms to infant EEG may lead to an overestimation of the degree of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19143957/

Processed electroencephalogram (bispectral index score), heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry and end-tidal sevoflurane were recorded every 5 min. The characteristics of emergence, objective pain score, sedation score and quality of sleep were recorded post-operatively. Duration of analgesia and requirement for additional analgesics were noted.
The end-tidal sevoflurane concentration and the incidence of agitation were significantly lower in the BD group (P < 0.05). The duration of analgesia was significantly longer (P < 0.001) and the total consumption of rescue analgesic was significantly lower in Group BD compared with Group B (P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in hemodynamics between both groups. However, group BD had better quality of sleep and a prolonged duration of sedation (P < 0.05).
Caudal DEX seems to be a promising adjunct to provide excellent analgesia without side effects over a 24-h period. It has the advantage of keeping the patients calm for a prolonged time.

The two groups were compared by evaluating the doses of propofol administered to patients and the satisfaction scores (scale of 0 - 10) of patients and endoscopists.
Although there were no significant differences between the two groups in the mean dose of propofol used (BIS group vs. no-BIS group, 5.32 mg/kg/hour vs. 4.85 mg/kg/hour; P = 0.10), the satisfaction scores of the patients (9.15 vs. 7.94; P < 0.01) and endoscopists (8.53 vs. 6.42; P < 0.001) were significantly higher with BIS monitoring.
Monitoring with BIS during the ESD procedure did not lead to a reduction in the dose of propofol required, but did lead to higher satisfaction scores from the patients and endoscopists. A complicated and prolonged endoscopic treatment such as ESD can be carried out with optimal safety, control, and comfort by using BIS to monitor propofol sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19023932/
19020432,"Presence of electroencephalogram burst suppression in sedated, critically ill patients is associated with increased mortality.",Critical care medicine,2008,"Watson PL, Shintani AK, Tyson R, Pandharipande PP, Pun BT, Ely EW","This study investigates the possibility of a relationship between oversedation and mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. The presence of burst suppression, a pattern of severely decreased brain wave activity on the electroencephalogram, may be unintentionally induced by heavy doses of sedatives. Burst suppression has never been studied as a potential risk factor for death in patients without a known neurologic disorder or injury.
Post hoc analysis of a prospectively observational cohort study.
Medical intensive care units of a tertiary care, university-based medical center.
A total of 125 mechanically ventilated, adult, critically ill patients.
A validated arousal scale (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) was used to measure sedation level, and the bispectral index monitor was used to capture electroencephalogram data. Burst suppression occurred in 49 of 125 patients (39%). For analysis, the patients were divided into those with burst suppression (49 of 125, 39%) and those without burst suppression (76 of 125, 61%). All baseline variables were similar between the two groups, with the overall cohort demonstrating a high severity of illness (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores of 27.4 +/- 8.2) and 98% receiving sedation. Of those with burst suppression, 29 of 49 (59%) died within 6 months compared with 25 of 76 (33%) who did not demonstrate burst suppression. Using time-dependent Cox regression to adjust for clinically important covariates (age, Charlson comorbidity score, baseline dementia, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, coma, and delirium), patients who experienced burst suppression were found to have a statistically significant higher 6-month mortality [Hazard's ratio = 2.04, 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.70, p = 0.02].
The presence of burst suppression, which was unexpectedly high in this medical intensive care unit population, was an independent predictor of increased risk of death at 6 months. This association should be studied prospectively on a larger scale in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19020432/
19020132,Recovery profiles from dexmedetomidine as a general anesthetic adjuvant in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2008,"Ohtani N, Kida K, Shoji K, Yasui Y, Masaki E","Dexmedetomidine induces less change in hemodynamic values during the extubation period. This drug may be useful in anesthetic management requiring smooth emergence from anesthesia. We sought to determine the effects of co-administration of dexmedetomidine on the recovery profiles from sevoflurane and propofol, which usually provide safe and rapid recovery when administered alone.
Sixty patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery were randomly divided into four groups according to the anesthetic to be administered; namely, sevoflurane (group S), propofol (group P), both sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine (group SD), or propofol and dexmedetomidine (group PD) as maintenance general anesthetics. After induction, anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (0.6%-1.5%) in group S, propofol (2-5 mg/kg/h) in group P, sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine (1 microg/kg over 10 min followed by 0.4 microg/kg/h until the end of surgery) in group SD, and propofol and dexmedetomidine in group PD with continuous epidural infusion. Bispectral Index values were maintained within 45 +/- 5 by changing the concentration of sevoflurane or the infusion rate of propofol in all groups. The time between the interruption of maintenance general anesthetics and eye opening was measured. Postoperative cognitive function was evaluated using the Short Orientation Memory Concentration Test.
The time to eye opening of groups S (8.5 +/- 2.5 min, mean +/- SD; n = 15) and SD (12.0 +/- 3.3 min) were comparable, whereas that of group PD (21.7 +/- 7.1 min) was longer than that of group P (11.0 +/- 4.4 min). The time to eye opening of group PD was significantly (P < 0.001) longer than those of the other three groups. The scores of Short Orientation Memory Concentration Test between groups S and P were similar and were not changed by co-administration of dexmedetomidine.
When co-administered with dexmedetomidine, sevoflurane produced a shorter time to eye opening than propofol. Postoperative cognitive function was not affected by dexmedetomidine administration. These results suggest dexmedetomidine may delay recovery when given as an adjuvant to propofol during total i.v. anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19020132/

One hundred and sixteen patients with traumatic complete SCI were grouped according to the time elapsed after the injury (<3 days and >9 months) and the level of injury (above T5 and below T5): acute high (AH, n=25), chronic high (CH, n=26), acute low (AL, n=20), and chronic low (CL, n=45). Twenty-five patients without SCI served as a control group. Bispectral index (BIS) response, systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), and plasma concentrations of catecholamines and arginine vasopressin were measured.
Both CH and CL groups showed a greater reduction in BIS values after induction of anaesthesia with thiopental compared with controls (P<0.05). However, BIS values after intubation increased similarly in all groups from the value measured just before laryngoscopy. SAP increased in the AL and CL and control groups but not in the AH and CH groups. HR increased significantly in all groups; though to a lesser degree in the AH compared with the other groups. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased in all except the AH group, but vasopressin concentrations were unchanged.
The arousal response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation as measured by BIS is not altered in SCI, but cardiovascular and catecholamine responses may be changed depending on time elapsed and the level of the injury. However, an identical dose of thiopental may reduce BIS value after intubation more profoundly in patients with chronic SCI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18987054/

As in recent studies attempting to correlate frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements with clinical evaluations of sedative efficacy, there is considerable overlap in numerical EEG values and different clinical levels of sedation. This precludes the use of these monitors for monitoring or titrating sedation in the critically ill. Despite many attempts, no study has yet presented data showing improved outcome with the use of EEG monitors in ICU sedation. Meanwhile, clinical sedation protocols have emerged, improving important endpoints in critically ill patients needing sedation. A major underlying problem in applying EEG monitors in the ICU is that they have been developed for measuring anesthetic depth and the related risk of recall, rather than the acknowledged endpoints of sedation, namely reduction of anxiety and discomfort. Until an 'objective' monitor is developed to measure the degree of such symptoms, physicians should continue treating patients and not numbers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18983711/

Using an intraoperative wake-up test, we compared the performance of both indices in distinguishing different hypnotic states, as evaluated by the University of Michigan Sedation Scale, in children and adolescents during propofol-remifentanil anesthesia for scoliosis surgery. Postoperative explicit recall was also evaluated.
Twenty patients (aged 10-20 yr) were enrolled. Prediction probabilities were calculated for induction, wake-up test, and emergence. BIS and cAAI were compared at the start of the wake-up test, at purposeful movement to command, and after the patient was reanesthetized. During the wake-up test, patients were instructed to remember a color, and were then interviewed for explicit recall.
Prediction probabilities of BIS and cAAI for induction were 0.82 and 0.63 (P < 0.001), for the wake-up test, 0.78 and 0.79 (P < 0.001), and 0.74 and 0.78 for emergence (P < 0.001). During the wake-up test, a significant increase in mean BIS and cAAI (P < 0.05) was demonstrated at purposeful movement, followed by a significant decline after reintroduction of anesthesia.
During induction, BIS performed better than cAAI. Although cAAI was statistically a better discriminator for the level of consciousness during the wake-up test and emergence, these differences do not appear to be clinically meaningful. Both indices increased during the wake-up test, indicating a higher level of consciousness. No explicit recall was demonstrated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18931233/

We sought to quantify and compare the dynamic profile of sevoflurane's effect measured with the cerebral state index (CSI) and the bispectral index (BIS) in children.
Fifteen healthy children, aged 3-15 yr, scheduled to undergo minor surgery were prospectively studied. During the simultaneous recording of CSI and BIS, the sevoflurane vaporizer was set at 6 vol % for 5 min and then decreased. End-tidal concentrations (C(ET)) were measured. The C(ET)-sevoflurane effect-site concentration equilibration and pharmacodynamics were modeled. Goodness of fit between models was compared. Data are typical value (coefficient of variation).
Within the anesthetic depth range studied, the rate of change of sevoflurane's effect expressed as the effect-site equilibration half-life (t(1/2) k(e0)) was slower with the CSI [2.0 (14) min] than with BIS [1.2 (53) min] (P < 0.05). The estimated baseline effect of BIS and CSI before sevoflurane administration (E(0)) was 84 (39) for CSI and 87 (7) for BIS (NS). The sensitivity to sevoflurane hypnotic effect expressed in the C(50) [steady-state C(ET) eliciting half of the maximum response (E(max))] was 2.1 (68) % with CSI and 2.1 (16)% with BIS (NS). The E(max) with CSI 45 (0) was higher than that with BIS 27 (39) (P < 0.05). The population prediction error was significantly better for BIS (-0.7 +/- 26.9) than for CSI (-3.0 +/- 178.6) (P < 0.05).
In children, the t(1/2) k(e0) of sevoflurane and the pharmacodynamics of sevoflurane were quantified and the results were entirely dependent on the monitor used to measure its hypnotic effect.

We prospectively investigated 38 patients who required administration of a muscle relaxant while continuously sedated with midazolam hydrochloride and fentanyl citrate to achieve a Ramsay Sedation Scale value equal to 5. BIS, EMG activity of BIS (EMG-BIS), signal quality index of BIS, AAI, EMG activity of AAI (EMG-AAI), and acceleromyography at the adductor pollicis muscle were recorded simultaneously every 5 min for 30 min before and after neuromuscular blockade.

Their overuse may prolong mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the intensive care unit. Guidelines recommend use of sedation protocols that include sedation scores and trials of sedation cessation to minimize drug use. We evaluated processed electroencephalography (response and state entropy and bispectral index) as an adjunct to monitoring effects of commonly used sedative and analgesic drugs and intratracheal suctioning.
Electrodes for monitoring bispectral index and entropy were placed on the foreheads of 44 critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation and who previously had no brain dysfunction. Sedation was targeted individually using the Ramsay Sedation Scale, recorded every 2 hours or more frequently. Use of and indications for sedative and analgesic drugs and intratracheal suctioning were recorded manually and using a camera. At the end of the study, processed electroencephalographical and haemodynamic variables collected before and after each drug application and tracheal suctioning were analyzed. Ramsay score was used for comparison with processed electroencephalography when assessed within 15 minutes of an intervention.
The indications for boli of sedative drugs exhibited statistically significant, albeit clinically irrelevant, differences in terms of their association with processed electroencephalographical parameters. Electroencephalographical variables decreased significantly after bolus, but a specific pattern in electroencephalographical variables before drug administration was not identified. The same was true for opiate administration. At both 30 minutes and 2 minutes before intratracheal suctioning, there was no difference in electroencephalographical or clinical signs in patients who had or had not received drugs 10 minutes before suctioning. Among patients who received drugs, electroencephalographical parameters returned to baseline more rapidly. In those cases in which Ramsay score was assessed before the event, processed electroencephalography exhibited high variation.
Unpleasant or painful stimuli and sedative and analgesic drugs are associated with significant changes in processed electroencephalographical parameters. However, clinical indications for drug administration were not reflected by these electroencephalographical parameters, and barely by sedation level before drug administration or tracheal suction.

This study examines the differences in intraoperative hemodynamic stability, cortisol levels and activity of cardiovascular hormones between combined anesthesia and isoflurane/fentanyl anesthesia.
Sixty ASA I-II patients were prospectively randomized to receive either combined anesthesia, i.e, isoflurane anesthesia combined with thoracic epidural analgesia (bolus of 12 ml 0.2% ropivacaine containing 1 microg/ml sufentanil 30 min before incision, followed by continuous infusion at 6 ml/h) or isoflurane/fentanyl anesthesia (IV fentanyl as required) for major abdominal surgery. Depth of anesthesia was monitored using Bispectral Index. Administration of fluids and of vasopressors was directed by a standardized protocol. Blood samples for angiotensin II, vasopressin, catecholamines, and cortisol were drawn before anesthesia, after induction (but before using the epidural catheter), and 40 min after skin incision.
After induction of anesthesia, mean arterial pressure decreased by 12-20 mmHg in both groups and angiotensin-II concentrations increased. Vasopressin increased predominantly after opening the abdomen in both groups. Under combined anesthesia, intraoperative epinephrine and cortisol concentrations were considerably lower. Intraoperative crystalloid fluid substitution, blood loss and urine output did not differ between groups. There were more hypotensive periods and the demand for colloids and low-dose continuous norepinephrine was greater under combined anesthesia.

After ethical committee approval and written patient consent, data from 35 patients [31 males, four females, age 55 (10) yr] were recorded during general anaesthesia for elective cardiac bypass surgery. All patients were induced with sevoflurane 8%, until the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS) scale level 1 was reached, and then was set at a 1% end-tidal sevoflurane concentration. Subsequently, remifentanil and atracurium were administered, the trachea was intubated, and the procedure continued as usual. To assess accuracy, the prediction probability (Pk) was calculated both during induction and during maintenance.
The Pk values [mean (se)] for IoC, BIS, and CSI during induction were 0.90 (0.01), 0.90 (0.01), and 0.88 (0.01), respectively, whereas the corresponding Pk values during maintenance were 0.95 (0.01), 0.94 (0.01), and 0.60 (0.01).
The three indices performed equally well during the induction phase and were able to predict the level of consciousness of the patients satisfactorily.

The number of children requiring sedation outside the traditional operating room is rapidly approaching the number of children requiring anesthesia in the operating room. We address some of the major issues and controversies in this continuously evolving field.
Pediatric sedation continues to be a challenging field. Recently, the Society of Pediatric Sedation has been created. In the last year, important issues have been raised among pediatric sedation providers, keeping on feeding the debate within all the recognized experts. Why worry about nihil per os status? Is bispectral index useful as a sedation monitor? Should there be standards for simulation-based training of nonanesthesiologists for delivery of sedation? Is propofol well tolerated? Is dexmedetomidine a good choice for painful procedures? What is the role of etomidate?
A standard approach (adequate preparation, clinical assessment of the child, fasting as required and right sedation plan) is mandatory to provide safety and efficiency. Sedation is a continuum, and it can be easy to advance from one level to the next and even reach a state of general anesthesia. Newer modalities such as end-tidal CO2 and, maybe, bispectral index monitoring are indeed enhancing the safety of procedural sedation and analgesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18660660/

Forty patients, aged 40-60 yrs, ASA I and II, undergoing laparoscopic hernias or cholecystectomy under general anesthesia were studied. All patients were connected to a BIS monitor. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 microg/kg, sevoflurane in oxygen, rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg), and maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen and 50% nitrous oxide, with an infusion of fentanyl (1 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)). Sevoflurane was titrated to maintain BIS near 50 throughout the procedure. Patients were randomly assigned to either listen to music or not.
The ETSevo necessary to maintain a BIS near 50 was virtually identical in patients who listened to music (1.29 +/- 0.33%) and those who did not (1.27 +/- 0.33%, P = 0.84). Patients who listened to music reported slightly less pain, but the difference was not statistically significant. Mean arterial blood pressure was slightly higher in patients who listened to music (101 +/- 11 mm Hg) than in those who did not (94 +/- 10 mm Hg, P = 0.040).
The end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane required to maintain BIS near 50 during laparoscopic cholecystectomy was virtually identical in patients exposed to music or not. Although previous work suggests that music reduces preoperative stress and may be useful during sedation, our results do not support the use of music during surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18635470/

In this study, I examined the effects, of AEP click sounds on the BIS, and also on the response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE) of the entropy monitor.
Forty patients aged 40-70 yr and scheduled for surgery of lower extremities under spinal anesthesia were anesthetized with 0.5% bupivacaine or tetracaine. Patients were sedated with midazolam 1 mg followed by propofol infusion started at 1 mg.kg(-1).h(-1). Propofol infusion was controlled to keep BIS or SE at 80, 60, or 40 for several minutes, and then click sounds (65 dB) of the AEP were given for 60 s. The changes in BIS, RE, and SE were observed continuously for 60 s after the click sounds had stopped.
BIS, SE, and RE significantly increased during the click sounds. The longest duration of increase was at BIS or SE 60.
AEP monitor click sounds transiently increased the simultaneously measured BIS, RE, and SE during different levels of sedation by propofol infusion during spinal anesthesia. Therefore, the effects of the click sounds should be considered when these monitors are used simultaneously in the same patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18633033/

It could be valuable to titrate the administration of inhaled anesthetic, such as sevoflurane, in morbid obese patients, in order to shorten emergence using bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. It would be a great advantage if BIS permitted a more rapid recovery and less consumption in morbidly obese patients with a high cost inhaled agent. The aim of the study is to show whether the titration of sevoflurane based on the BIS monitoring would allow shortening of recovery time in morbidly obese patients and to evaluate whether BIS monitoring would contribute to reduce the amount of sevoflurane administered while providing an adequate anesthesia.
Thirty morbidly obese ASA I & II patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) procedures were studied. In the first group (15 patients), patients were anesthetized without the use of BIS (non BIS or control group), and sevoflurane being administered according to standard clinical practice (control group). In the second group (15 patients), sevoflurane was titrated to maintain a BIS value between 40 and 60 during surgery, and then 60-70 during 15 min prior to the end of surgery (BIS group). Recovery times were recorded. Time to extubation was also noted, as well as the time to achieve a modified Aldrete score of 9 were evaluated subsequently at 10-min intervals until 3 h after surgery by nurses who had no knowledge of the study. Sevoflurane consumption was calculated using the vaporizer weighing method.
Awakening and extubation times were significantly shorter in the BIS group (P < 0.05). In the BIS (vs. non BIS) group, there were no significant differences observed in the time to obtain an Aldrete score of 9. The sevoflurane consumption and cost in the BIS group were lower than in the non BIS group (P < 0.05).
Bispectral index monitoring during anesthesia for morbidly obese patients provides statistically significant reduction in recovery times. It also has the added advantage in decreasing sevoflurane consumption.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18630768/

Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study.
Patients were divided into three groups as follows: Group 1 received propofol, 1 mg/kg; Group 2 received landiolol, 0.1 mg/kg; and Group 3 received nicardipine, 1 mg. After baseline measurements were recorded, anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl, and vecuronium. Patients' lungs were ventilated with 100% oxygen for 120 seconds, at which time one of one of the study drugs was administered. Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation were performed 4 minutes after anesthetic induction.
Cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume index (SVI) were monitored continuously. Bispectral index was also monitored continuously from 5 minutes after tracheal intubation.
Heart rate values in Group 3 increased 30 seconds after intubation; this increase lasted for 1 minute after intubation. Systolic blood pressure in all three groups decreased after induction of anesthesia and before tracheal intubation, and values returned closer to baseline values 30 seconds after intubation. In the propofol group, CI and SVI decreased after administration of additional propofol, lasting for 30 seconds after intubation. The BIS values rapidly decreased after induction of anesthesia, with no intergroup differences noted in BIS values (propofol group, 39+/-7; landiolol group, 44+/-14; nicardipine group, 41+/-9). However, BIS was significantly lower in the propofol group than in the other two groups from 30 seconds to 5 minutes after intubation.

It is useful in laryngeal framework surgery because intraoperative voice monitoring while the patient remains awake is required.
In laryngeal framework surgery, it is desirable to monitor the voice during surgery. However, surgery is conducted under general anesthesia, although such a procedure renders the patient unable to phonate during surgery. We conducted TIVA without intubation, allowing patients to breathe spontaneously while undergoing operation, and succeeded in intraoperative voice monitoring with satisfactory postoperative voice production.
The subjects were 21 patients who underwent surgery. For TIVA, propofol and pentazocine were used as a sedative and analgesic, respectively. A bispectral index (BIS) monitor was used to measure the depth of the anesthesia. Before the vocal folds were to be rotated, propofol administration was interrupted to arouse and instruct the patient to phonate. Guided by the phonation, the vocal folds were correctly positioned. Then propofol administration was resumed, and the wound was closed.
The BIS value during continued administration of propofol was around 60, but exceeded 90 in all patients within 233.6 +/- 64.5 s after cessation. They clearly remembered the conversation they had with us during surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18607947/

We studied it in a prospective crossover design using a fixed protocol without lockout time to examine it as an alternative method of sedation for changing dressings in burned patients. Eleven patients with >10% total burn surface area (TBSA) had their dressings changed, starting with sedation by an anaesthetist (ACS). The second dressing change was done with PCS (propofol/alfentanil) and the third time the patients had to choose ACS or PCS. During the procedures, data on cardiopulmonary variables, sedation (bispectral index), pain intensity (VAS), procedural details, doses of drugs, and patients' preferences were collected to compare the two sedation techniques.
The study data indicated that wound care in burned patients is feasible with a standardized PCS protocol. The patients preferred PCS to ACS on the basis of self-control, and because they had less discomfort during the recovery period. Wound care was also considered adequate by the staff during PCS. No respiratory (respiratory rate/transcutaneous PCO(2)) or cardiovascular (heart rate/blood pressure) adverse events were recorded at any time during any of the PCS procedures. The doses of propofol and alfentanil and BIS index decrease were less during PCS than ACS. Procedural pain was higher during PCS but lower after the procedure.
We suggest that PCS using a standard protocol is an interesting alternative to anaesthetist-provided sedation during dressing changes. It seems effective, saves resources, is safe, and at same time is preferred by the patients. The strength of these conclusions is, however, hampered by the small size of this investigation and therefore further studies are warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18603377/

Seventy-seven critically ill children receiving sedation and mechanical ventilation.
Simultaneous recording of BIS, AEP index, RS and CS were performed once a day, for a maximum of 5 days. Two levels of sedation were categorized: light-moderate versus deep-very deep. Correlations between methods were determined using Spearman rank correlation test and the agreement using Cohen's Kappa test. The correlation and agreement between the four methods was moderate-to-good. Correlation was not found in paralyzed children. There was no correlation between the four methods and the heart rate or blood pressure, or with the type or dose of sedative medication. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed best discrimination between light-moderate and deep-very deep sedation at BIS and AEP index values of 63.5 and 33.5 when the level of sedation was classified by the RS, and at BIS and AEP index values of 67 and 37.5, respectively, when the level of sedation was classified by the CS.

Loss of consciousness (LOC) was repetitively induced by bolus injections of propofol in 24 patients undergoing elective surgery in spinal anaesthesia. SSEP and the BIS were recorded during LOC and recovery of consciousness (ROC). The level of consciousness was clinically assessed by the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale. Propofol venous plasma concentrations were measured simultaneously.
At LOC, all SSEPs latency components were prolonged (P<0.001), whereas amplitudes of the components > or = 45 ms were smaller (P=0.008) and the BIS values were lower (P<0.001). None of the EEG variables regained baseline levels during ROC. Regression analyses revealed that the SSEP components (five latencies and five amplitudes) explained 33% of the variance when predicting ROC; the BIS explained 12%. The combination of SSEP and BIS explained 37% of variance in this patient sample. Propofol venous plasma concentration was 1.2 (0.8) microg ml(-1) during LOC and 0.4 (0.5) microg ml(-1) during ROC.
The present results indicate the usefulness of combining variables of the evoked and spontaneous EEG to measure different levels of consciousness, because the SSEP provide additional information beyond the BIS.

Subsequent reports, though, were inconsistent. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that intraoperative magnesium sulfate administration reduces postoperative requirement for opioids, secondary outcomes were intraoperative muscle relaxant, sevoflurane consumptions and postoperative pain.
Fifty American society of anesthesiology status (ASA) I-II patients who gave a written informed consent were scheduled for elective lumbar disc surgery. The Institutional Review Board approved the study. Patients were randomly assigned to the placebo group (n = 25) or magnesium group (n = 25). Patients assigned to the magnesium group were given an initial infusion of 30 mg/kg (over 10 minutes) starting immediately after anesthesia and completed before intubation. The infusion was then continued at 10 mg/kg/hr throughout surgery. General anesthesia was induced with propofol, 2.5 mg/kg, and maintained with sevoflurane 2 percent in a 50 percent O2/50 percent N2O mixture. The sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to keep bispectral index (BIS) values between 45 and 60. Both groups were given atracurium, 0.6 mg/kg, and a remifentanil infusion at an initial dose of 0.1 mg/kg/h. The remifentanil infusion was adjusted to maintain heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP) within 20 percent of baseline values. Atracurium administration was repeated when the train of four (TOF) ratio exceeded 0.30. Intubation conditions were scored. At the end of surgery, the authors assessed recovery using early recovery criteria and Aldrete recovery scores. Postoperative analgesia was maintained with morphine via patient-controlled analgesia.
Heart rate, MAP and pulse oximetry (SPO2) values were similar in the groups at all times. Intubating conditions were similar except that the increase in MAP was greater in the placebo group.

Even though the role of sleep disturbances is not still adequately understood, they may be related to metabolic, immune, neurological and respiratory dysfunction and could worsen the quality of life after discharge. A harsh ICU environment, underlying disease, mechanical ventilation, pain and drugs are the main reasons that underlie sleep disruption in the critically ill. Polysomnography is the gold standard in evaluating sleep, but it is not feasible in clinical practice; therefore, other objective (bispectral index score [BIS] and actigraphy) and subjective (nurse and patient assessment) methods have been proposed, but their adequacy in ICU patients is not clear. Frequent evaluation of neurological status with validated tools is necessary to avoid excessive or prolonged sedation in order to better titrate patient-focused therapy. Hypnotic agents like benzodiazepines can increase total sleep time, but they alter the physiological progression of sleep phases, and decrease the time spent in the most restorative phases compared to the phases normally mediated by melatonin; melatonin production is decreased in critically ill patients, and as such, exogenous melatonin supplementation may improve sleep quality. Sleep disruption and the development of delirium are frequently related, both because of sleep scarcity and inappropriate dosing with sedatives. Delirium is strongly related to increased ICU morbidity and mortality, thus the resolution of sleep disruption could significantly contribute to improved ICU outcomes. An early evaluation of delirium is strongly recommended because of the potential to resolve the underlying causes or to begin an appropriate therapy. Further studies are needed on the effects of strategies to promote sleep and on the evaluation of better sleep in clinical outcomes, particularly on the development of delirium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18500209/

Operating room.
63 ASA physical status I and II patients, aged 55 to 75 years, undergoing total knee replacement.
Patients were divided into three groups: noise, silence, and music. After induction of combined spinal-epidural anesthesia, sedation was begun with 1.2 mug/mL of propofol in a target-controlled infusion. In the silence group, patients' ears were packed tightly to block ambient noise, whereas patient-selected music was applied to patients in the music group. Patients in the noise group were exposed to ambient operating room noise.
Bispectral index measurement was recorded 7 times during operation. Ambient room noise was recorded at the same time sequence.
Sound level was highest when the saw (T3, 80.25 dB) and the impact device (T4, 80.98 dB) were in use. Bispectral index scores in the silence group during those times (T3, 68.5 vs 76.9, P = 0.025, and T4, 67.6 vs 78, P = 0.005) were lower than in the noise group. However, BIS scores were similar in the noise and music groups. Preoperative anxiety level, postoperative comfort level, and pain scores were similar in all groups.
Blocking noise is more effective than playing music in reducing BIS scores during propofol sedation in a noisy environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18346603/

Use of the bispectral index (BIS), developed from a processed electroencephalogram, has been reported to decrease the incidence of anesthesia awareness when the BIS value is maintained below 60. In this trial, we sought to determine whether a BIS-based protocol is better than a protocol based on a measurement of end-tidal anesthetic gas (ETAG) for decreasing anesthesia awareness in patients at high risk for this complication.
We randomly assigned 2000 patients to BIS-guided anesthesia (target BIS range, 40 to 60) or ETAG-guided anesthesia (target ETAG range, 0.7 to 1.3 minimum alveolar concentration [MAC]). Postoperatively, patients were assessed for anesthesia awareness at three intervals (0 to 24 hours, 24 to 72 hours, and 30 days after extubation).
We assessed 967 and 974 patients from the BIS and ETAG groups, respectively. Two cases of definite anesthesia awareness occurred in each group (absolute difference, 0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.56 to 0.57%). The BIS value was greater than 60 in one case of definite anesthesia awareness, and the ETAG concentrations were less than 0.7 MAC in three cases. For all patients, the mean (+/-SD) time-averaged ETAG concentration was 0.81+/-0.25 MAC in the BIS group and 0.82+/-0.23 MAC in the ETAG group (P=0.10; 95% CI for the difference between the BIS and ETAG groups, -0.04 to 0.01 MAC).
We did not reproduce the results of previous studies that reported a lower incidence of anesthesia awareness with BIS monitoring, and the use of the BIS protocol was not associated with reduced administration of volatile anesthetic gases. Anesthesia awareness occurred even when BIS values and ETAG concentrations were within the target ranges. Our findings do not support routine BIS monitoring as part of standard practice.

The primary aim of our observational study was to assess the difference in BIS values between the left and right sides of the brain. Secondary aims were to compare BIS and COMFORT score and to assess change in BIS with tracheal suctioning.
Nineteen ventilated and sedated PICU patients had paediatric BIS sensors applied to either side of their forehead. Each patient underwent physiotherapy involving tracheal suctioning. Their BIS data and corresponding COMFORT score, assessment as by their respective nurses, were recorded before, during, and after physiotherapy.
Seven patients underwent more than one physiotherapy session; therefore, 28 sets of data were collected. The mean BIS difference values (and 95% CI) between left BIS and right BIS for pre-, during, and post-physiotherapy periods were 9.2 (5.9-12.5), 15.8 (11.9-19.7), and 7.5 (5.2-9.7), respectively. Correlation between mean BIS, left brain BIS, and right brain BIS to COMFORT score was highly significant (P<0.001 for all three) during the pre- and post-physiotherapy period, but less so during the stimulated physiotherapy period (P=0.044, P=0.014, and P=0.253, respectively).

We hypothesised that MB would decrease propofol requirements. The Bispectral index (BIS) and a target-controlled infusion of propofol were used in two groups of 11 matched patients. Patients in one group were pretreated with MB. During induction, clinical sedation scores and BIS values were significantly lower at the predicted effect-site propofol concentration of 2 microg x ml(-1) in the MB compared with the control group. Intra-operatively, although similar BIS values were achieved in the two groups, patients pretreated with MB required a mean 50% lower dose of propofol compared with controls.

The study group consisted of 15 adult patients (10 male, 5 female), who were applied nasal packing at the end of nasal surgery. The control group consisted of 15 adult patients (10 male, 5 female), who received general anesthesia for various reasons. In the study and control groups, BIS index, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, pulse per minute and blood pressure were measured at seven different times.
There was no statistically significant difference between BIS indexes of the study and control groups. In the fourth hour after sleep (AS-4h), respiratory rate of the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group. In the fourth hour after the anesthesia (AA-4h), oxygen saturation value of the study group was lower than that of the control group.
We conclude that in patients who are applied nasal packing at the end of nasal surgery; at AA-4h and AS-4h times, there may be risk of decrease in the oxygen saturation and respiratory rate parameters, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor non-invasive respiratory parameters and to give enriched oxygen by an oral catheter.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18329208/

Forty-two patients undergoing day case excisional biopsy of breast mass were randomly assigned to receive propofol-remifentanil or sevoflurane-N2O. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained either with sevoflurane and 50% N2O in oxygen or with target-controlled remifentanil and propofol in 50% oxygen and air. Anaesthetic depth was monitored by the bispectral index.
The times for induction (2.9 vs. 1.7 min) and for laryngeal mask insertion (5.7 vs. 3.3 min) were longer in the sevoflurane-N2O group than in the propofol-remifentanil group. However, apnoea (57.1% vs. 9.5%) and bradycardia (23.8% vs. 0%) were more prevalent with propofol-remifentanil. In the sevoflurane-N2O group, the emergence times to a verbal response (10.6 vs. 3.7 min), to extubation (11.8 vs. 4.0 min) and to orientation (14.7 vs. 4.8 min) were longer than in the propofol-remifentanil group. There were significantly more nausea (38.1% vs. 4.8%) and vomiting (19.2% vs. 0%) in the sevoflurane-N2O group than in the propofol-remifentanil group. The time to discharge was similar although there was less postoperative pain in the sevoflurane-N2O group. There were no differences in the perioperative cortisol responses in the two groups.

BIS, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, sedation scores, and anaesthetic protocols from 59 children aged 1-16 yr undergoing general surgery were considered for the study. Anaesthesia was performed with propofol, fentanyl, and remifentanil. A sigmoid model assuming additive interaction of propofol, fentanyl, and remifentanil was fitted to individual BIS as effect variable. The pharmacodynamic parameters were estimated by non-linear regression analysis. The ability of BIS to predict anaesthetic drug effect was quantified by the prediction probability Pk.
BIS started at a baseline of 90 (9), decreased during induction to 30 (14) and remained at 57 (10) during anaesthesia. BIS predicted the anaesthetic drug effect with a Pk of 0.79 (0.08). The EC(50 Propofol) and the k(e0 Propofol) were 5.2 (2.7) microg ml(-1) and 0.60 (0.45) min(-1), respectively. The k(e0 Propofol) decreased from approximately 0.91 min(-1) at 1 yr to 0.15 min(-1) at 16 yr. The EC(50 Remifentanil), k(e0 Remifentanil), EC(50 Fentanyl), and the k(e0 Fentanyl) were 24.1 (13.0) ng ml(-1), 0.71 (0.32) min(-1), 8.6 (7.4) ng ml(-1), and 0.28 (0.46) min(-1), respectively.
The effect equilibration half-time of propofol in children was age dependent. The pharmacodynamics of fentanyl and remifentanil in children were similar to those reported in adults. The BIS showed a close relationship to the modelled effect-site concentration, and therefore, it may serve as a measure of anaesthetic drug effect in children older than 1 yr.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18270231/

The present study is the first large-scale, intraoperative assessment of awareness during paediatric anaesthesia using the isolated forearm technique, and the first large-scale study of memory function during paediatric anaesthesia.
One hundred and eighty-four children, 5-18 yr, underwent the isolated forearm technique during the first 17 min of surgery while receiving volatile anaesthesia. The isolated forearm technique was modified to accommodate brief or no paralysis. Bispectral index was monitored in a subset of 54 patients. Sixteen neutral words were played 20 times during surgery and, on recovery, implicit memory for these words was tested with a word identification task. Explicit memory for the surgical period was tested with a structured interview. Behavioural changes were assessed with age-appropriate questionnaires.
No child had explicit recall of intraoperative events on recovery, and there was no evidence of implicit memory for words presented during anaesthesia. Two of 184 children made unambiguous and verified responses on the modified isolated forearm technique, an incidence of intraoperative awareness of 1.1%. One of these children reported that he was uncomfortable and not completely unconscious during surgery. Neither child had implicit memory for the neutral words, or adverse behaviour change.

After mask induction with xenon and intubation, anesthesia was continued with xenon only. BIS, State Entropy and Response Entropy, and electroencephalogram were monitored throughout induction, steady-state anesthesia, and emergence. The performance of BIS, State Entropy, and Response Entropy were evaluated with prediction probability, sensitivity, and specificity analyses. The power spectrum of the raw electroencephalogram signal was calculated.
The mean (SD) xenon concentration during anesthesia was 66.4% (2.4%). BIS, State Entropy, and Response Entropy demonstrated low prediction probability values at loss of response (0.455, 0.656, and 0.619) but 1 min after that the values were high (0.804, 0.941, and 0.929). Thereafter, equally good performance was demonstrated for all indices. At emergence, the prediction probability values to distinguish between steady-state anesthesia and return of response for BIS, State Entropy, and Response Entropy were 0.988, 0.892, and 0.992. No statistical differences between the performances of the monitors were observed. Quantitative electroencephalogram analyses showed generalized increase in total power (P < 0.001), delta (P < 0.001) and theta activity (P < 0.001), and increased alpha activity (P = 0.003) in the frontal brain regions.

The scores for the bispectral index may not reflect correct values in children, but may be helpful during titration of sedatives such as midazolam and ketamine.
We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in 126 patients scheduled for cardiac catheterization in a teaching hospital. They ranged in age from 4 months to 15 years. In 66 patients, sedation was performed without use of the bispectral index, while the index was used in the other 60 patients. The data collected included heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, saturation of oxygen, amount of sedatives, awakening time and adverse effects. We subdivided the patients into age-related groups for each parameter.
The demographic data were not statistically different. Monitoring with the bispectral index in those aged from 1 to 3 years revealed use of lower doses of midazolam, at 2.09 mg per kg per hr, with standard deviation of 0.36, and similarly lowers doses of ketamine, at 2.07 mg per kg per hr, with standard deviation of 0.22, the values in those not monitored being 2.93, with standard deviation of 0.45, and 2.96 with standard deviation of 0.51 respectively, these difference being statistically significant (p = 0.001 and p = 0.04, respectively). In those aged from 3 to 6 years of age, dosage of midazolam was 2.09, with deviation of 0.36, and of ketamine 1.78, with deviation of 0.27, following use of the bispectral index, compared to 2.89 with deviation of 0.28, and 2.62 with deviation of 0.69 respectively, when the bispectral index was not used, these again being significant differences (p = 0.033 and p = 0.04).

Standard methods of sedation monitoring are labor-intense. Bispectral index monitoring (BIS) is widely used during anesthesia, but its benefits during conscious sedation are controversial. Thus, we performed a prospective observational study to assess its ability for detecting deep sedation during endoscopy.
Patients presenting for elective outpatient endoscopy were monitored simultaneously with the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (MOAA/S) and BIS. A combination of a narcotic and benzodiazepine was used, with the target being moderate sedation and analgesia. Deep sedation was defined by MOAA/S score of 1-2 and BIS score of <or=75. With MOAA/S as the reference standard, the accuracy of BIS for detecting deep sedation was evaluated.
A total of 775 simultaneous observations of BIS and MOAA/S scores were recorded on 76 patients. Deep sedation, defined by MOAA/S and BIS, was seen in 204 (26%) and 92 (12%) observations, respectively. BIS correlated poorly with deep sedation (rho, -0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.16-0.12). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (95% CI) for detecting deep sedation were 29.6 (23.4-36.3), 94.9 (92.8-96.6), 68.2 (57.4-77.7), and 78.6 (75.3-81.7), respectively.

This study used a mail-out survey to audit sedation management within the eight dedicated Australian and New Zealand PICUs.
100% of the units surveyed replied (n=8). There were a total of 6,133 admissions to 8 Australian and New Zealand PICUs, where 3036 (49.5%) required ventilation. Of these children, 888 (29.2%) required ventilation > or =72 hours. Only 4 units had written guidelines for sedation management. A combined sedation regime of benzodiazepines and opioids was employed in six units. Administration and titration of sedation agents was managed by nursing staff alone in six units. All units indicated that they aimed to achieve a 'moderate level' of sedation. Two units used designated assessment tools for sedation and withdrawal assessment. One unit utilised Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring.
There were similarities observed in the methods and types of sedation agents used within Australian and New Zealand PICUs. However, only half of the units had guidelines for sedation management, and most units did not use validated paediatric scales to assist staff in assessing patient sedation and pain levels.

It is assumed that the manipulated variable is the infusion rate of the hypnotic drug propofol, while the drug remifentanil is also administered for analgesia. Since these two drugs interact, the administration rate of remifentanil is considered as an accessible disturbance in combination with the level of electromyography (EMG) that also interferes with the BIS signal. In order to tackle the high uncertainty present on the system, the predictive adaptive controller MUSMAR is used. The performance of the controller is illustrated by means of simulation with 45 patient individual adjusted models, which incorporate the effect of the drugs interaction on BIS.

This study evaluated a rational selection of EEG variables as measures of arousal during surgical anaesthesia in children.
Sixty children undergoing surgical anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil were enrolled. The performance of 33 single EEG variables and bispectral index (BIS) was assessed by simultaneous analysis of prediction probability (Pk) of Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Sedation Scores and their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Variables performing best in Pk and SNR analysis were selected as potential measures of arousal. Their performance was investigated in five age groups, 0-1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-8, and 8-13 yr.
Single EEG variables such as relative power from frequency bands 13-20 and 20-26 Hz, SEF95, and approximate entropy performed best with Pk>0.59 and SNR>5.50. The Pk and SNR of BIS were 0.71 and 15.76, respectively. Their performance was significantly better in children aged 1-13 yr than in 0-1 yr.
BIS may provide a measure of arousal during propofol anaesthesia in children, but its accuracy is less in infants younger than 12 months. Single EEG variables such as high-frequency components of EEG, SEF95, and approximate entropy may be of limited value to detect arousal in the individual paediatric patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17965418/

The use of bispectral index to guide the dose of anaesthetics may have certain advantages over clinical signs.
The objective of this review was to assess whether bispectral index (BIS) reduced anaesthetic use, recovery times, recall awareness and cost.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1990 to May 2007), EMBASE (1990 to May 2007) and reference lists of articles.
We included randomized controlled trials comparing BIS with clinical signs (CS) in titrating anaesthetic agents.
Two authors independently assessed trial quality, extracted data and analysed the data. We contacted study authors for further details.
We included 20 studies with 4056 participants. Seven recent trials are still awaiting assessment. BIS-guided anaesthesia reduced the requirement for propofol by 1.30 mg/kg/hr (578 participants; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.97 to -0.62) and for volatile anaesthetics (desflurane, sevoflurane, isoflurane) by 0.17 minimal alveolar concentration equivalents (MAC) (689 participants; 95% CI -0.27 to -0.07). Irrespective of the anaesthetic, BIS reduced the recovery times: time for eye opening by 2.43 min (996 participants; 95% CI -3.60 to -1.27), response to verbal command by 2.28 min (717 participants; 95% CI -3.47 to -1.09), time to extubation by 3.05 min (1057 participants; 95% CI -3.98 to -2.11) and orientation by 2.46 min (316 participants; 95% CI -3.21 to -1.71). BIS shortened the duration of postanaesthesia care unit stay by 6.83 min (584 participants; 95% CI -12.08 to -1.58) but did not reduce time to home readiness (329 participants; 95% CI -30.11 to 16.09). The BIS-guided anaesthesia significantly reduced the incidence of intraoperative recall awareness in surgical patients with high risk of awareness (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.79).
Anaesthesia guided by BIS within the recommended range (40 to 60) could improve anaesthetic delivery and postoperative recovery from relatively deep anaesthesia. In addition, BIS-guided anaesthesia has a significant impact on reduction of the incidence of intraoperative recall in surgical patients with high risk of awareness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17943802/

This technique appeared to be inadequate to produce BIS values less than 60 in isoflurane and sevoflurane.
To assess BIS value during general anesthesia with 3% and 4.5% desflurane in 50% N2O before delivery.
The parturients were blinded and randomized in opaque envelopes to one of the two study groups. Seventy-two elective caesarean section ASA I - II parturients were induced and intubated with thiopental 4 mg/kg, succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg and were received either 3% or 4.5% desflurane in 50% N2O to maintain general anesthesia. Both groups received rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg for muscle relaxation. Morphine 0.1 mg/kg and midazolam 0.06 mg/kg were administered after delivery.
There were no differences in demographic data in both groups. The incidences of patients with a satisfactory BIS score (< 60) in the 4.5% desflurane group was 81% that was significantly more than 42% in the 3% desflurane group (p < 0.000). Mean BIS values at neonatal delivery were 62 +/- 8 in the 3% desflurane group, versus 49 +/- 12 in the 4.5% desflurane group. Indices of maternal and neonatal outcome were similar between the two groups.

During the 6-month period, 75 patients were enrolled. The Spearman correlation between the BIS and the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation was 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.74). The Spearman correlation between the BIS and the Continuum of Depth of Sedation was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.36-0.70). The mean minimum BIS for patients without a complication was 70 (SD, 15.9) compared with 68 (SD, 12.9) for patients with a complication (difference = 2; 95% CI, -7-11).
Our study demonstrated moderate correlation between BIS and the 2 clinical sedation scales. The correlation is not strong enough to be used reliably in a clinical setting.

A properly trained anaesthetist, administering anaesthesia according to their knowledge of pharmacology and patient and surgical characteristics, assisted by clinical signs and monitoring, can minimize this risk. Relying upon volatile-based anaesthesia delivered at a concentration of at least 0.5 MAC may be effective, but this precludes the use of total intravenous anaesthesia techniques and in any case may lead to unwanted hypotension. Equipment failure may occur. Benzodiazepines do not protect the patient from awareness. The development of electroencephalographic monitors of anaesthetic depth provides an opportunity to prevent awareness. Two large scale studies, one of which was a randomized trial, have identified a 5-fold reduction in risk of awareness when depth of anaesthesia using bispectral index monitoring was used. The incidence of awareness can be further reduced with currently available techniques used more widely.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17900013/

Following the approval of the executive committees of the British and French pediatric anesthesia societies, members with a valid email contact address were invited to participate in a web-based survey. Perceived risk factors, use of awareness monitors, pre- and postoperative discussions of awareness as well as personal experience were enquired.
A total of 302 (51%) responded to the email survey. More than 60% indicated that awareness is a problem in pediatric anesthesia with the majority estimating an incidence of 1 : 1000. Almost half (49%) the respondents believe that awareness is age-dependent and 50% are not concerned below 1 month of age. More than 86% of respondents do not discuss the risk of awareness with the parents or actively look for awareness despite 27% reporting at least one episode in their practice. Intra-operative monitoring almost exclusively consists of clinical signs and endtidal anesthetic concentrations. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is routinely used by approximately 10% of the surveyed members.
This survey demonstrates that European pediatric anesthesiologists perceive awareness as a major problem. However, none seems to address the issue openly or looks for its presence routinely.

A prospective randomized controlled study was designed to observe whether a lighter depth of general anesthesia could prevent the unintentional hypotension induced by the epinephrine scalp infiltration during neurosurgery or not. Fifty patients undergoing scheduled neurosurgery involving craniotomy were randomly allocated into 2 groups. After anesthesia induction, anesthesia was maintained with propofol 2 mug/mL and rimifentanil 2 ng/mL by target-controlled infusion in group 1, and propofol 4 microg/mL and rimifentanil 4 ng/mL in group 2 (control group), respectively. All the patients received epinephrine scalp infiltration with 1% lidocaine 16 mL containing epinephrine 5 microg/mL. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate were recorded at 30-second interval from the baseline to 5 minutes after the beginning of local infiltration. Bispectral index readings indicated group 1 had the lighter general anesthesia than group 2 (P<0.05). MAP was higher (P<0.05) and heart rate was lower (P<0.05) at 1.5 minutes time point in group 1 than group 2. The mean percentage of maximal decrease in MAP was group 1 (13%) <group 2 (24%) (P<0.05). The mean percentage of maximal increase in MAP was group 1 (10%)> group 2 (4%) without significant difference (P>0.05).

No study has evaluated the effects of gabapentin on acute, postoperative pain in patients undergoing surgery for brachial plexus injuries. In this preliminary study, we evaluated gabapentin as preemptive analgesic for intraoperative period and during the acute postoperative period at rest and during movement. Twenty consecutive adult patients undergoing surgery for brachial plexus injury were enrolled for the study. Patients randomly received either oral gabapentin 800 mg or placebo capsules 2 hours before surgery. General anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol, at bispectral index value between 40 and 60. Intraoperative fentanyl and propofol requirements were noted. Postoperatively, all patients were alert and pain was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) for 24 hours, both during rest and movement. Whenever VAS score was more than 50 or on patients' demand, ketorolac 30 mg was given as rescue analgesic. The demographics, duration of surgery, and propofol consumption in both groups were comparable. Intraoperative and postoperative heart rate and mean blood pressure were also comparable. Significant difference was noted in intraoperative fentanyl consumption (P=0.03), total dose of rescue analgesic (P=0.004), and VAS score at rest and movement, between the 2 groups; less in gabapentin group as compared with placebo group (P=0.01 and 0.04, at rest and movement, respectively).

17870474,The association of a decreased level of awareness and blood alcohol concentration with both agitation and sedation in intoxicated patients in the ED.,The American journal of emergency medicine,2007,"Miner JR, Gaetz A, Biros MH","This study was conducted to compare the level of awareness as determined by serial bispectral index (BIS) electroencephalogram scores to a standardized Altered Mental Status (AMS) scale used to define a patient's clinical level of agitation or sedation, and the patient's concurrent breath/blood alcohol concentration (BAC).
This was an institutional review board-approved, prospective observational study of a convenience sample of patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) with the chief complaint of ethanol (ETOH) intoxication between July 19, 2003, and March 27, 2004. The AMS scale is a 9-point scale: -4 is unresponsive, 0 is normal examination, and +4 is extremely agitated. After ETOH was detected by breath analyzer, enrolled patients had a BIS monitor probe applied to their forehead. Baseline BAC, BIS, and AMS scores were recorded independently of the patients' caregivers. Bispectral index and AMS scores were repeated every 20 minutes for 1 hour. The patient's diagnosis, disposition, (any) complications, and total time in department were recorded.
Ninety-eight patients were enrolled in the study. The median presenting AMS score was -1. The mean total time in department was 402.6 minutes (SD, 196.4; range, 246-906 minutes). The mean presenting BIS score was 77.6 (SD, 17.9; range, 26-98). The mean presenting BAC was 0.229 (SD, 0.07; range, 0.049-0.43). The mean BIS index varied from 59.6 +/- 16.9 for AMS scores of -4, to 96.3 +/- 2.7 for AMS scores of 0, to 90.5 +/- 4.9 for AMS scores of 4. The AMS scale correlated with the BIS scale (Spearman's rho = 0.67, P < or = .001), but did not correlate with BAC (Spearman's rho = -0.14, P = 0.15).
Changes in the AMS scale corresponded to changes in the BIS index score. A decreased level of awareness, as determined on the BIS index, was observed in patients who were either agitated or sedated by the AMS. We conclude that both agitated and sedated patients with ETOH intoxication show decreases in their level of awareness. Therefore, the AMS scale, which includes both agitation and sedation, is a valid measure of a patient's decreased level of awareness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17870474/

With institutional review board approval and waiver of consent, data from 4 independently conducted studies were combined in a secondary analysis of 3373 observations from 248 children aged 1 month to 18 years. In these studies, bispectral index values of sedated children were recorded in a blinded fashion, and sedation depth was scored using the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS). Bispectral index was evaluated across UMSS scores for several age groups and during use of each sedative agent (with/without opioids).
There was a moderate inverse correlation between bispectral index and UMSS for all age groups. There were significant differences in bispectral index across UMSS and between each sedation level except UMSS 3 to 4 in all the age groups and UMSS 0 to 1 in infants. The mean bispectral index and the cutoff values on the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for mild, moderate, and deep sedation were significantly lower in infants < or = 6 months compared with older children at each sedation level. Bispectral index was reasonably sensitive and specific in differentiating mild (UMSS 0-1) from deeper (UMSS 3-4) levels of sedation but poorly differentiated between moderate and deep levels of sedation in all age groups. There was a moderate correlation between bispectral index and UMSS during the use of chloral hydrate, pentobarbital, propofol, and midazolam but poor correlation during ketamine or opioid use. Bispectral index values were significantly lower during deep sedation with propofol and pentobarbital compared with midazolam and chloral hydrate.
Our findings suggest that, although bispectral index may differentiate light from deep sedation in most children, bispectral index must be interpreted cautiously in sedated children, with particular consideration given to patient age and use of sedative agents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17766490/
17721241,Median frequency revisited: an approach to improve a classic spectral electroencephalographic parameter for the separation of consciousness from unconsciousness.,Anesthesiology,2007,"Jordan D, Stockmanns G, Kochs EF, Schneider G","In the past, several electroencephalographic parameters have been presented and discussed with regard to their reliability in discerning consciousness from unconsciousness. Some of them, such as the median frequency and spectral edge frequency, are based on classic spectral analysis, and it has been demonstrated that they are of limited capacity in differing consciousness and unconsciousness.
A generalized approach based on the Fourier transform is presented to improve the performance of electroencephalographic parameters with respect to the separation of consciousness from unconsciousness. Electroencephalographic data from two similar clinical studies (for parameter development and evaluation) in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia with sevoflurane or propofol are used. The study period was from induction of anesthesia until patients followed command after surgery and includes a reduction of the hypnotic agent after tracheal intubation until patients followed command. Prediction probability was calculated to assess the ability of the parameters to separate consciousness from unconsciousness.
On the basis of the training set of 40 patients, a new spectral parameter called weighted spectral median frequency was designed, achieving a prediction probability of 0.82 on the basis of the ""classic"" electroencephalographic frequency range up to 30 Hz. Next, in the evaluation data set, the prediction probability was 0.79, which is higher than the prediction probability of median frequency (0.58) or spectral edge frequency (0.59) and the Bispectral Index (0.68) as calculated from the same data set.
A more general approach of the design of spectral parameters leads to a new electroencephalographic spectral parameter that separates consciousness from unconsciousness significantly better than the Bispectral Index.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17721241/

Our aim has been to evaluate sedation of intubated surgical critically ill patients by means of the Ramsay sedation score, the Bispectral index and ENTROPY, and to analyse the correlation between these variables.
Sedation was evaluated every 15 min for a 1 h period in 50 non-paralysed postoperative critically ill, intubated patients, enrolled over a 6 month period. A 5 min steady-state period was allowed before each assessment. Both the Bispectral index and the Entropy parameters Response Entropy (RE) and State Entropy (SE), were collected before assessing the Ramsay scale.
Mean values for SE, RE and BIS were 53 +/- 27, 60 +/- 30, and 62 +/- 24 respectively. The median value for the Ramsay was 6 (range 1-6). Significant correlation was found between the four variables (SE-BIS: r = 0.79, p < 0.001; RE-BIS: r = 0.80, p < 0.001; SE-Ramsay: rho = -0.71, p < 0.001, RE-Ramsay: rho = -0.72, p < 0.001; BIS-Ramsay: rho = -0.78, p < 0.001; RE-SE: r = 0.98, p < 0.001).

We designed this study to evaluate the sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic, and hemodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine administered intranasally in healthy volunteers.
Koch's design for crossover trials (three-treatment and two-period design) was adopted. The study was double-blind and there were three treatment groups: A (placebo), B (intranasal dexmedetomidine 1 microg/kg) and C (intranasal dexmedetomidine 1.5 microg/kg).

These were repeated during the course of the study.
Intranasal dexmedetomidine was well tolerated. Both 1 and 1.5 microg/kg doses equally produced significant sedation and decreases in bispectral index, SBP, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate when compared with placebo (P < 0.05). The onset of sedation occurred at 45 min with a peak effect at 90-150 min. The maximum reduction in SBP was 6%, 23%, and 21% for Groups A, B, and C respectively. There was no effect on pain pressure threshold, oxygen saturation or respiratory rate. Anxiolysis could not be evaluated as no subjects were anxious at baseline.
The intranasal route is effective, well tolerated, and convenient for the administration of dexmedetomidine. Future studies are required to evaluate the possible role of the noninvasive route of administration of dexmedetomidine in various clinical settings, including its role as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17646493/

We report the case of a 290-kg super-obese patient scheduled for open bariatric surgery. A propofol-remifentanil TCI (target controlled infusion) was chosen as the anaesthetic technique both for sedation during awake fibreoptic nasotracheal intubation and for maintenance of anaesthesia during surgery. Servin's weight correction formula was used for propofol. Arterial blood samples were taken at fixed time points to assess the predictive performance of the TCI system. A significant difference between measured and predicted plasma propofol concentrations was found. After performing a computer simulation, we found that predictive performance would have improved significantly if we had used an unadjusted pharmacokinetic set. However, in conclusion (despite the differences between measured and predicted plasma propofol concentrations), the use of a propofol-remifentanil TCI technique both for sedation during awake fibreoptic intubation and for Bispectral Index-guided propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia resulted in a rapid and effective induction, and operative stability and a rapid emergence, allowing rapid extubation in the operating room and an uneventful recovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17635437/

If BIS could predict sedation depth in ICU patients, patient disturbances could be reduced and oversedation avoided. Twenty ventilator-dependent ICU patients aged 27 to 80 years were randomised to sedation with isoflurane via the AnaConDa or intravenous midazolam. BIS (A-2000 XP, version 3.12), electromyogram activity (EMG) and Signal Quality Index were measured continuously. Hourly clinical evaluation of sedation depth according to Bloomsbury Sedation Score (Bloomsbury) was performed. The median BIS value during a 10-minute interval prior to the clinical evaluation at the bedside was compared with Bloomsbury. Nurses performing the clinical sedation scoring were blinded to the BIS values. End-tidal isoflurane concentration was measured and compared with Bloomsbury. Correlation was poor between BIS and Bloomsbury in both groups (Spearman's rho 0.012 in the isoflurane group and -0.057 in the midazolam group). Strong correlation was found between BIS and EMG (Spearman's rho 0.74). Significant correlation was found between end-tidal isoflurane concentration and Bloomsbury (Spearman's rho 0.47). In conclusion, BIS XP does not reliably predict sedation depth as measured by clinical evaluation in non-paralysed ICU patients sedated with isoflurane or midazolam. EMG contributes significantly to BIS values in isoflurane or midazolam sedated, non-paralysed ICU patients.

Forty-five patients were divided into three groups to receive epidurally administered saline (Group S), 1.5% (w/w) lidocaine (Group L), or 0.5% (w/w) ropivacaine (Group R). Propofol infusion was started to produce blood concentration of 4 mug/ml. Once the BIS value reached 40~50, endotracheal intubation was facilitated by 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium. Measurements included the time to LOC, effect-site propofol concentrations, total propofol dose, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), and heart rate (HR) at different study time points.
During induction of anesthesia, both Groups L and R were similar for the time to LOC, effect-site propofol concentrations, total propofol dose, MABP, HR, and BIS. The total doses of propofol administered until 1 min post-intubation were significantly less in patients of Groups R and L compared with Group S. MABP and HR were significantly lower following propofol induction compared with baseline values in the three groups, or MABP was significantly increased following intubation as compared with that prior to intubation in Group S but not in Groups R and L while HR was significantly increased following intubation in the three groups.

Review of the literature using the MEDLINE database and review of the experience in pediatric intensive care units.
The continuous administration of analgesics and sedatives prevents the development of undersedation and is less demanding in terms of care than intermittent administration. Midazolam is the most commonly used drug for continuous sedation of critically ill children. Opioid derivatives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the most widely used analgesics in critically ill children. Opioids combined with benzodiazepines, given in continuous infusion, are the drugs of choice in mechanically ventilated children, especially morphine and fentanyl. The use of protocols and monitoring through clinical scores and objective methods (e.g. bispectral index) allow adjusting medication more appropriately, preventing oversedation, undersedation, and the withdrawal syndrome. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as music therapy, noise control, adequate use of light, massage, conversation with the patient, are ancillary measures that help children to adapt to the adverse hospital environment.
Sedation should be tailored to each child for each specific situation. Protocols that facilitate the correct selection of drugs, their appropriate administration and careful monitoring improve the quality of sedation and analgesia and avoid their adverse effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17530139/

During the implantation procedure for the electrodes, the patient emerges from anesthesia repeatedly to facilitate neurological testing. We investigated whether Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring would be beneficial in patients receiving ""sleep-awake-sleep"" anesthesia with respect to time of arousal, consumption of propofol, and cardiopulmonary stability (i.e., heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and end-tidal carbon dioxide).
We investigated 21 patients scheduled for implantation of DBS electrodes. Depth of propofol anesthesia was controlled either with BIS guidance in 10 patients (BIS group) or without in 11 patients (non-BIS group). In the BIS group, a BIS score of 40-60 was targeted during sleep periods, whereas in the non-BIS group, a value of 1 (= no response to tactile stimulation [unconsciousness]) on the Observers' Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale was targeted. For analgesia, the sites for the burr holes and for the pins of the stereotactic ring were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine; no opioids were used. For periods during which an awake patient required neurological testing, propofol was discontinued.
We found no difference between groups with respect to times of arousal, total amount of propofol consumption, and cardiopulmonary stability.

The aim of this study was to compare the haemodynamic effects of remifentanil pTCI and eTCI during induction of anaesthesia in ASA III patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
28 ASA III patients, scheduled for cardiac surgery, were randomized in two groups: Group pTCI received remifentanil to achieve an effect-site target of 15 ng ml(-1) by limiting Cp to 15 ng ml(-1) and group eTCI received remifentanil to achieve an effect-site target of 15 ng ml(-1) without limiting remifentanil Cp.

Auditory-evoked potentials were collected before induction of anaesthesia, 10 min after intubation, 30 min after sternotomy, during cardiopulmonary bypass at the time of cross-clamping of the aorta and during stable mild hypothermia, after de-clamping of the aorta, and after the operation.
At the pre-determined time points, bispectral index values showed comparable depth of hypnosis in both groups. The latency of the Nb component of midlatency auditory-evoked potentials was significantly increased in the isoflurane group after intubation (P < 0.001) and that of both the Nb and the Pa components after sternotomy (P < 0.001) compared with the propofol group. No differences between the groups were detected with respect to haemodynamic variables. No patient reported recall of intraoperative events.

Induction of MAC was produced by bolus doses of midazolam 0.03 mg/kg(-1) and fentanyl 0.5 microg/kg(-1) followed by intravenous infusion of midazolam 0.015 to 0.06 mg/kg(-1)/hr(-1) with fentanyl supplementation 0.2 microg/kg(-1). In addition, group I patients received magnesium sulfate 30 mg/kg(-1) intravenously as a bolus dose followed by a continuous infusion of 10 mg/kg(-1) /hr(-1) beginning 15 minutes before induction of sedation. The midazolam infusion rate and additional fentanyl doses were adjusted by verbal analog scale (VAS) measurements, observer assessment sedation score (OAA/S), and achieving a target bispectral index (BIS) in a range of 70 to 90. At the end of SWL, the total midazolam and total fentanyl consumptions were recorded, and the serum magnesium concentration was measured.
Magnesium caused significant decreases in the total consumption of midazolam (P = 0.001) and fentanyl (P = 0.001). The VAS values at the 15th, 20th, and 25th minute in group I were significantly lower than in group II. In group I, hemodynamic and arterial oxygen parameters were better than in group II.
A magnesium bolus and infusion can be utilized to reduce analgesic requirements under MAC during SWL.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17338610/

We tested whether the two monitors would reflect hypnosis equally during propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia.
During laparoscopy or breast/surface surgery, 55 non-paralyzed patients were monitored simultaneously with the BIS and the CSM. Trend curves for the indexes [BIS and cerebral state index (CSI)] were compared for congruence. The difference between the two indexes for the entire course was quantified, and the ability of the two monitors to separate awake from asleep during induction was described.
In the majority of the patients, 87%, there was a good fit between the indexes. There were major deviations in seven patients, in whom CSI indicated that the patients were awake during parts of the course despite clinical sleep, correctly identified with the BIS. Both indexes separated awake from asleep during induction in the individual patient, but the overlap in values between patients was more pronounced for CSI.
CSM and BIS show some important differences in measuring hypnotic state during clinical propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17330331/

A group of 34 patients undergoing implantology were divided at random into 2 groups of 17. They were evaluated physically, clinically and psychologically. The psychomotor activity was measured by the Newman's test. Preoperative anxiety was treated with chlordemethyldiazepam (CHDDZ) per os, administered before induction of conscious sedation. In the first group, conscious sedation was accomplished by induction with titrated doses of i.v. diazepam, and in the second group with 0.1 mg/kg of intranasal midazolam. BIS values were analysed as Area Under the Curve (AUC).
The AUC BIS values after CHDDZ presedation were overlapping in both groups. AUC after midazolam decreased after induction of the conscious sedation (P<0.05), during anesthesia (P<0.01) and during intervention (P<0.01) compared to the diazepam treatment. In the midazolam group the BIS values were on average lower than 90, while in the diazepam group they were on average higher than 95 (P<0.01). The psychomotor recovery was more impaired after midazolam.
The study shows that nasal route ensures the quick absorption of midazolam as revealed during the first 3 min from drug administration. The depressant effect of midazolam increased as a function of time, reaching the highest levels during intervention. The results suggest that midazolam is endowed with sedative effects which may compromise the state of consciousness of the patient and be incompatible with the definition of conscious sedation in dentistry.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17327813/

Because hypoxaemia is the most common cause of critical deterioration during anaesthesia and sedation, improved understanding of the effects of anaesthetics on pulmonary function is essential. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different levels of propofol anaesthesia on functional residual capacity (FRC) and ventilation distribution.
In 20 children without cardiopulmonary disease mean age (SD) 49.75 (13.3) months and mean weight (SD) 17.5 (3.9) kg, anaesthesia was induced by a bolus of i.v. propofol 2 mg kg(-1) followed by an infusion of propofol 120 microg kg(-1) min(-1) (level I). Then, a bolus of propofol 1 mg kg(-1) was given followed by a propofol infusion at 240 microg kg(-1) min(-1) (level II). FRC and lung clearance index (LCI) were calculated at each level of anaesthesia using multibreath analysis.
The FRC mean (SD) decreased from 20.7 (3.3) ml kg(-1) at anaesthesia level I to 17.7 (3.9) ml kg(-1) at level II (P < 0.0001). At the same time, mean (SD) LCI increased from 10.4 (1.1) to 11.9 (2.2) (P = 0.0038), whereas bispectral index score values decreased from mean (SD) 57.5 (7.2) to 35.5 (5.9) (P < 0.0001).

Previous studies have shown that opioids reduce the clinical requirements of sedatives needed to provide adequate anesthesia. Processed electroencephalographic parameters, such as the Bispectral Index (BIS; Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) and Auditory Evoked Potential Index (AAI; Alaris Medical Systems, San Diego, CA), can be used intraoperatively to assess the depth of sedation. The aim of this study was to characterize how the addition of opioids sufficient to change the clinical level of sedation influenced the BIS and AAI.
Twenty-four adult volunteers received a target-controlled infusion of remifentanil (0-15 ng/ml) and inhaled sevoflurane (0-6 vol%) at various target concentration pairs. After reaching pseudo-steady state drug levels, the modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score, BIS, and AAI were measured at each target concentration pair. Response surface pharmacodynamic interaction models were built using the pooled data for each pharmacodynamic endpoint.
Response surface models adequately characterized all pharmacodynamic endpoints. Despite the fact that sevoflurane-remifentanil interactions were strongly synergistic for clinical sedation, BIS and AAI were minimally affected by the addition of remifentanil to sevoflurane anesthetics.
Although clinical sedation increases significantly even with the addition of a small to moderate dose of remifentanil to a sevoflurane anesthetic, the BIS and AAI are insensitive to this change in clinical state. Therefore, during ""opioid-heavy"" sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthetics, targeting a BIS less than 60 or an AAI less than 30 may result in an unnecessarily deep anesthetic state.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17325505/

In 66 patients, anaesthesia was maintained at two different levels using bispectral index. Doses of sufentanil and midazolam were adjusted to achieve a bispectral index in the range of 45-55 in 33 patients (BIS 50 group) and 35-44 in another 33 patients (BIS 40 group). Simultaneously, state entropy and response entropy were recorded.
The targeted values of bispectral index were achieved in both groups and the bispectral index values differed significantly during whole anaesthesia. Median response entropy and state entropy fell to 19-26 during anaesthesia in both groups. Response entropy and state entropy values in the two groups differed significantly only after induction of anaesthesia and did not differ during further anaesthesia. There was no explicit intraoperative recall in both groups. Patients in Group BIS 40 received significantly (P<0.05) more sufentanil than the BIS 50 group (704+/-181 microg vs. 490+/-107 microg, respectively) and midazolam (18.5+/-6.1 mg vs. 15.6+/-3.8 mg, respectively). After cardiopulmonary bypass, significantly (P<0.05) more patients in Group BIS40 needed inotropic support with dobutamine (79%) than in the BIS50 group (52%). Time to extubation did not differ between the two groups.
In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, no relationship was found between bispectral index levels and state entropy and response entropy at two different stages of a sufentanil-midazolam anaesthesia.

Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, has sedative, analgesic and anxiolytic properties without respiratory depression. These characteristics make it potentially suitable as a sedative agent during diagnostic procedures in children. We report our experience using dexmedetomidine in 20 children aged 3 months to 10 years undergoing cardiac catheterization.
Following a midazolam premedication, intravenous access was secured facilitated by the inhalation of sevoflurane in oxygen. A loading dose of 1 microg x kg(-1) dexmedetomidine was administered over 10 min followed by an initial infusion rate of 1 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1). Nasal cannulae were applied, allowing endtidal CO2 monitoring with the patients breathing spontaneously. Hemodynamic parameters, Bispectral Index Score (BIS) and sedation score were measured every 5 min. Patient movement or evidence of inadequate sedation were treated with propofol (1 mg x kg(-1)). The dexmedetomidine infusion rate was titrated to the level of sedation to a maximum of 2 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) to maintain a sedation score of 4-5 and a BIS value <80.
Five patients (25%) had some movement on local infiltration or groin vessel access. This did not necessitate restraint or result in difficulty securing vascular access. No patients failed sedation that required the addition of another sedative agent or conversion to GA; eight patients were sedated with dexmedetomidine alone; however, 12 (60%) patients did receive a propofol bolus at some time during the procedure due to movement, increasing BIS value or in anticipation of stimulation. There were no incidences of airway obstruction or respiratory depression. In all cases the heart rate and blood pressure remained within 20% of baseline. No patient required treatment for profound bradycardia or hypotension. The average infusion rate for dexmedetomidine following the loading dose was 1.15 (+/-0.29)microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) (range 0.6-2.0 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)).

Literature searches were conducted through MEDLINE for case series/reports, retrospective studies, and randomized trials that evaluate the validity and applications of BIS monitoring in the PED and PICU.
Most of the studies are case series or retrospective studies in children. There are several prospective studies assessing validation of the monitor in children. Only a few studies have been performed that assess the influence of monitoring on outcomes in these environments.
Bispectral values correlate fairly well with commonly used clinical sedation scores, but more variability in the scores has been observed at lighter levels of sedation.

Dreaming may be related to light anesthesia and represent near-miss awareness. However, few studies have assessed the relation between dreaming and depth of anesthesia, and their results were inconclusive. Therefore, the authors tested the hypothesis that dreaming during anesthesia is associated with light anesthesia, as evidenced by higher Bispectral Index values during maintenance of anesthesia.
With approval, 300 consenting healthy patients, aged 18-50 yr, presenting for elective surgery requiring relaxant general anesthesia with a broad range of agents were studied. Patients were interviewed on emergence and 2-4 h postoperatively. The Bispectral Index was recorded from induction until the first interview. Dream content and form were also assessed.
Dreaming was reported by 22% of patients on emergence. There was no difference between dreamers and nondreamers in median Bispectral Index values during maintenance (37 [23-55] vs. 38 [20-59]; P=0.68) or the time at Bispectral Index values greater than 60 (0 [0-7] vs. 0 [0-31] min; P=0.38). Dreamers tended to be younger and male, to have high home dream recall, to receive propofol maintenance or regional anesthesia, and to open their eyes sooner after surgery. Most dreams were similar to dreams of sleep and were pleasant, and the content was unrelated to surgery.
Dreaming during anesthesia is unrelated to the depth of anesthesia in almost all cases. Similarities with dreams of sleep suggest that anesthetic dreaming occurs during recovery, when patients are sedated or in a physiologic sleep state.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17197843/

General anesthesia was induced and maintained with target-controlled infusion of propofol at an effect-site concentration of 5 microg/mL. Muscle relaxation was obtained with 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, and endotracheal intubation was performed 4 min after vecuronium injection. We first investigated the optimal time point for landiolol to be administered before intubation in 43 normotensive patients.

Landiolol at 0.1 mg/kg was most effective against intubation-induced tachycardia when infused 4 min before intubation in normotensive patients. However, 0.2 mg/kg landiolol was necessary to prevent tachycardia after intubation in hypertensive patients. Landiolol had no significant effects on arterial blood pressure or bispectral index at any dose throughout the study period.

Patient movement, coughing, stridor or laryngospasm at LMA placement may result in transient hypoxia, injury to the patient and prolong time spent in the anesthetic room. The Bispectral Index Score (BIS) is a relatively new tool that has not yet established its place in routine clinical pediatric anesthesia practice. One potential use may be to predict an adequate depth of anesthesia for successful intraoperative interventions such as LMA placement in children.
A total of 116 children aged between 1 and 16 years due to have an LMA placed under general anesthesia were enrolled into this prospective, blinded observational study. Complication or success of LMA placement was then analyzed in relation to the BIS value at the time of placement. Other clinical variables were also considered.
The difference in BIS values in children with complicated compared with successful LMA placement was small and BIS therefore appears not to be a reliable predictor for either. Inexperience of the anesthetist and a history of recent upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) may be better indicators for complications.
Bispectral Index Score appears, from this study, not to be a useful tool to help predict complications of LMA placement or to help reduce airway complications during LMA placement. Other markers may be more useful predictors of adverse airway events.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17121554/

Many studies showed that premedication with melatonin is associated with preoperative anxiolysis and sedation without impairment of cognitive and psychomotor skills and without prolonging recovery. We hypothesized that melatonin decreases the amount of propofol required to produce an adequate depth of hypnosis at induction time.
After approval from the research committee of the anaesthesia department, informed written consent was taken from 45 adult patients undergoing different surgical procedures. They were allocated randomly into three groups according to the premedication. At 100 min preoperatively, premedication was given in the form of oral melatonin 3 mg (M3 group), oral melatonin 5 mg (M5 group) or no premedication (P group). After preoxygenation an anaesthesiologist who was blinded to the premedication injected propofol 10 mg over 5 s every 15 s until the bispectral index (BIS) score fell to 45. The total dose of propofol required to achieve a BIS score of 45 was recorded. Response to verbal commands and eyelash reflex was evaluated and correlated to the BIS score and propofol dosage. When a BIS score of 45 was reached, tracheal intubation was accomplished after administration of a narcotic and muscle relaxant.

17065885,No sex differences in memory formation during general anesthesia.,Anesthesiology,2006,"Stonell CA, Leslie K, He C, Lee L","Women respond differently to anesthesia than men, initially recovering more rapidly, but having more postoperative morbidity. Studies on surgical patients report evidence of memory formation during anesthesia. However, sex differences in memory formation have not been explored. Therefore, the authors investigated sex differences in the implicit and explicit memory formation during general anesthesia.
With ethics committee approval, 120 consenting adult patients scheduled to undergo surgery during general anesthesia were recruited. Intraoperatively, 16 target words were presented to patients via headphones, and the Bispectral Index was recorded. Postoperatively, memory for presented words was tested using a word stem completion test. The test was divided into inclusion and exclusion parts, to delineate implicit and explicit memory contributions.
Target and distracter hit rates were similar in men and women. For the whole study group, there was a significant difference between inclusion target hit rate (0.42) and base hit rate (0.39) (P = 0.01). Buchner's model suggested that this memory formation was attributable to both implicit and explicit memory. A Bispectral Index value greater than 50 was the only significant predictor of inclusion target hit rate. None of the patients were able to consciously recall the words presented during surgery.
Patients showed greater memory performance for words presented during general anesthesia than for words not presented. However, sex differences in memory formation were not observed. A relation between hypnotic state and memory during sevoflurane anesthesia was also established, suggesting that memory formation is possible even at hypnotic depths considered to be adequate anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17065885/

Patients underwent simultaneous measurement of lorazepam concentration and sedation assessments using the Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) and Bispectral Index (BIS). Lorazepam administration was classified as either continuous intravenous infusion (CIVS) or bolus.
A total of 124 observations were made in 13 patients. The median concentration was 59 ng/ml, interquartile range 23 - 93 ng/ml, range 0 - 1,072 ng/ml. Clearance was preserved at 92 +/- 71 ml/min. Higher concentrations were associated with deeper sedation determined by both SAS and BIS. Two patients were managed with CIVS and received more lorazepam than those managed without (288 +/- 53.5 versus 55 +/- 25.2 mg, p-value < 0.005). CIVS administration was associated with higher concentrations (629 +/- 36 versus 49 +/- 15 ng/ml, p-value < 0.001) and deeper sedation by both SAS and BIS.
Lorazepam clearance was preserved with a wide range of concentrations. Higher concentrations were associated with deeper sedation and use of CIVS. Elevated concentrations during CIVS were attributable to administration of larger doses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17063976/

Forty patients were randomized into one of two groups, a target BIS 25 (n =21) or a target BIS 40 (n =19). Patients received premedication with midazolam 20 microg/kg and fentanyl 0.5 microg/kg. Sevoflurane induction of anaesthesia was initiated and titrated to reach the target BIS value and maintained within the target range for two minutes. The trachea was then intubated, with intubating conditions being assessed using a standardized scale. The BIS 25 group had a superior median intubating score of 4 (range 3-9,[IQR 4-5]) vs the BIS 40 group with a median of 7 (5-10, [6-9], P<0.001). The time to reach target BIS values was not statistically different (BIS 25 group 6.6 min, BIS 40 group 5.1 min, P=0.054). End-tidal sevoflurane concentration upon reaching the target BIS was higher in the BIS 25 group (5.3% +/- 1.2%) vs the BIS 40 group (3.5% +/- 0.95) (P<0.001). There was no statistical difference in haemodynamic parameters between groups. A target BIS value of 25 provides good to excellent intubating conditions and better intubating conditions than a target BIS of 40 during sevoflurane induction of anaesthesia without the use of neuromuscular blocking agents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17061635/

Bispectral index (BIS) and middle-latency auditory-evoked potentials (Alaris AEP index, AAI) were reported to be accurate indicators for the level of sedation and loss of consciousness. We assessed these monitors during sedation with special emphasis on preventing over-sedation. One-hundred patients scheduled for elective eye surgery were sedated with target-controlled propofol infusion and randomly allocated to BIS-guided, AAI-guided, BIS/AAI-guided, or clinically guided groups (n = 25 each). The initial target concentration was 0.5 microg x mL(-1) in patients >70 yr and 1.0 microg x mL(-1) in all other patients. The concentration was increased every 3 min by 0.1 or 0.2 microg x mL(-1), respectively until the patient had reached a BIS value of 75 (range 70-90) or an AAI of 40 (range 35-60). The surgeon who was blinded to group allocation assessed treatment quality after the procedure. Sedation was converted into general anesthesia in four patients because of excessive head movements. BIS was out of range 7% of the time vs 58% for AAI. No significant differences in treatment quality were observed among the four groups. We conclude that propofol sedation, guided by BIS or AAI monitoring, did not enhance ophthalmic surgical operating conditions over sedation guided by clinical observation only.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17056953/

Electrophysiologic monitoring may offer an approach to solving this problem. Since electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to different sedation regimens vary, we assessed electrophysiologic responses to two sedative drug regimens in 10 healthy volunteers. Dexmedetomidine/remifentanil (dex/remi group) and midazolam/remifentanil (mida/remi group) were infused 7 days apart. Each combination of medications was given at stepwise intervals to reach Ramsay scores (RS) 2, 3, and 4. Resting EEG, bispectral index (BIS), and the N100 amplitudes of long-latency auditory-evoked potentials (ERP) were recorded at each level of sedation. During dex/remi, resting EEG was characterized by a recurrent high-power low-frequency pattern which became more pronounced at deeper levels of sedation. BIS Index decreased uniformly in only the dex/remi group (from 94 +/- 3 at baseline to 58 +/- 14 at RS 4) compared to the mida/remi group (from 94 +/- 2 to 76 +/- 10; P = 0.029 between groups). The ERP amplitudes decreased from 5.3 +/- 1.3 at baseline to 0.4 +/- 1.1 at RS 4 (P = 0.003) in only the mida/remi group. We conclude that ERPs in volunteers sedated with dex/remi, in contrast to mida/remi, indicate a cortical response to acoustic stimuli, even when sedation reaches deeper levels. Consequently, ERP can monitor sedation with midazolam but not with dexmedetomidine. The reverse is true for BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17056949/

This study tested the hypothesis that sevoflurane affect BIS values, rSO(2), and the pharmacokinetics of propofol during propofol/ N(2)O anesthesia.
General anesthesia was administered to 15 ASA I-II patients with a continuous infusion of propofol to maintain a BIS value of 45 +/- 5. After recording baseline values, patients were assigned to receive sevoflurane (2.0%, 20 min). BIS values, rSO(2) using near-infrared spectroscopy, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded for 60 min. Cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) were evaluated using impedance cardiograph methods. Propofol concentration was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography.
Sevoflurane (2.0%, 20 min) decreased the BIS score from 47.4 +/- 8.2 to 27.3 +/- 5.9 (P < 0.01, n = 15) without affecting rSO(2). Sevoflurane decreased systolic blood pressure from 112.1 +/- 14.0 mmHg to 96.5 +/- 13.2 mmHg (P < 0.001, n = 15) without affecting heart rate. Both CO and SV were significantly decreased during sevoflurane application. Propofol concentration was increased from 2.71 +/- 0.51 microg/ml to 3.30 +/- 0.57 microg/ml (P < 0.05) after sevoflurane application, and was returned to baseline after sevoflurane washout.
We have shown that sevoflurane decreases BIS values during propofol/N(2)O anesthesia without affecting rSO(2) and that this change is accompanied by an increase in serum propofol concentration. Changes in propofol concentration may be due to, at least in part, hemodynamic changes such as decreased CO produced by sevoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17006727/

State Entropy (SE) reflects the level of hypnosis. Response Entropy (RE), computed from electroencephalogram and facial muscle activity, reflects the response to nociceptive stimulation. We evaluated the effect of rocuronium on Bispectral Index (BIS) and entropy responses to laryngoscopy.
A total of 25 patients were anaesthetized with propofol using a target-controlled infusion. At steady state, they randomly received 0.6 mg kg(-1) rocuronium (R) or saline (S). After 3 min, a 20 s laryngoscopy was applied. BIS, RE and SE were recorded continuously and averaged over 1 min during baseline, at steady state, 2 min after R or S administration (R/S+2) and 0, 1, 2 and 3 min after laryngoscopy (L0, L1, L2, L3).
At R/S+2, the RE-SE gradient was higher in Group S than in Group R. Laryngoscopy provoked an increase in BIS, RE and SE. Comparing R/S+2 and L0 values in Groups R and S, BIS increased from 43 (6) to 49 (8) and 42 (9) to 51 (15), SE increased from 43 (7) to 50 (8) and 41 (10) to 55 (12), and RE increased from 46 (8) to 54 (9) and 47 (12) to 66 (15), respectively. BIS and SE did not differ between groups. At L0, RE and RE-SE were higher in Group S [66 (15) and 11 (4), respectively] than in Group R [54 (9) and 4 (2), respectively].

In the present study we evaluated the relationship between EEG bicoherence and sevoflurane concentration. Sixteen ASA physical status I-II patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were enrolled in the study. Anesthesia was induced with 5% sevoflurane and maintained with sevoflurane and oxygen (50%). Just before surgery, IV fentanyl (2 microg/kg) was given and then continuously infused (2 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)). Using software we developed, EEG bicoherence, BIS, and 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) were recorded at end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations of 0.5%, 0.8%, 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.3%. Under light anesthesia, EEG bicoherence values were low. With increasing sevoflurane concentrations, 2 peaks of bicoherence emerged along the diagonal line (f1 = f2). Both the first (at around 4 Hz) and second (at around 10 Hz) grew higher (37.7% +/- 7.5% and 35.1% +/- 9.0%, respectively) as the sevoflurane concentration increased to 1.4%. However, the first peak leveled off whereas the second tended to decrease slightly with further increases in sevoflurane concentration. The BIS value decreased as the sevoflurane concentration increased and leveled off at 1.4% and higher concentrations of sevoflurane. The SEF 95 also decreased as the sevoflurane concentration increased up to 2.3%. Thus the distribution pattern of the two bicoherence peaks is likely to be better than BIS of the anesthetic effect of sevoflurane during surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16931674/

This study aimed at determining if caudal blockade decreases the level of arousal, as measured by Bispectral Index (BIS) in unstimulated children, and to determine if this effect differed between age groups.
Hospital ethics committee approval and parental consent was obtained. Children (age between 24 months and 5 years) and infants (between 6 and 24 months of age) were recruited if they were scheduled for below umbilical surgery that would usually require caudal local anesthesia blockade. Before the procedure, subjects within each age group were randomized to either caudal group (1 ml.kg(-1) 0.25% bupivacaine), or control group (no caudal). In all groups, anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and maintained at a constant endtidal concentration of 1.5% sevoflurane without N(2)O. Five minutes after induction a baseline BIS was recorded (BIS(1)). In the caudal groups, a caudal block was then performed while in the control groups no block was performed.

As this can result in an inadequate depth of anaesthesia, we determined the predicted effect site concentration (C(e)) of propofol necessary to obtain a bispectral index (BIS) of 50 in 50% (EC(e50)) of children and adults.
Twenty adults (aged 33-44 years) and 20 children (aged 3-11 years) undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia were studied. All were monitored with a BIS monitor, and a target controlled infusion of propofol aiming for a constant C(e) value was started. After 10 min, patients were evaluated using a sedation scale, and the last 5 min was used to determine the mean BIS for this C(e) value. The C(e) value of propofol was defined using the up-and-down method of Dixon and Massey. The first patient in each group received C(e)= 6 microg/ml; thereafter, it was modified in 0.5 microg/ml decrements/increments with positive or negative responses, respectively. A positive response was BIS < 50 and a negative response was BIS > or = 50. The EC(e50) value was compared using unpaired Student's t-test. The prediction probability (P(K)) was used to study the association between BIS and the sedation score.
The mean EC(e50) (95% confidence interval) values were 3.75 microg/ml (2.97-4.75 microg/ml) in adults and 3.65 microg/ml (3.36-3.96 microg/ml) in children (not significant). All patients with BIS < 50 were unarousable with tactile stimulation. The P(K) value was 0.99 in both groups.

Oral clonidine significantly decreased SAI scores, OAA/S, EMG, and Blink, but did not cause statistically significant BIS or DSST reductions. Subjects preferred oral clonidine pretreatment prior to venipuncture compared to placebo. Questionnaires also indicated that clonidine provided minimal sedation, considerable anxiolysis, and some analgesia. Fingertip versus forearm skin temperature differentials were decreased. Reduced fingertip versus forearm temperature differentials suggest increased peripheral cutaneous blood flow prior to venous cannulation.

Anesthesiologists should be aware that the BIS monitor may not be sensitive enough to provide an adequate measure of the depth of sedation and hypnosis when using N2O alone for sedation. It may be better to monitor sedation clinically (e.g., with the OAA/S scale) to determine the dose requirement and the adequacy of depth of sedation and hypnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16861421/

This sedation/analgesia should allow the patient to communicate while also remaining calm. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring could be useful in achieving this. The primary end-point of our study was to compare the percentage time with optimal sedation, defined as Sedation Agitation Scale (SAS) grade 4, between a BIS-guided remifentanil/propofol regimen and a clinically guided regimen in 54 randomly allocated patients. The mean +/- sd percentage time with optimal sedation was significantly longer (P = 0.004) in the BIS group (76.6% +/- 14.7%) than in the SAS group (63.8% +/- 16.4%). There was a significant difference in the weighted mean infusion rates of remifentanil (P = 0.0067) and propofol (P = 0.0075) in the BIS group (0.066 +/- 0.027 microg.kg(-1) . min(-1) 1.59 +/- 0.44 mg.kg(-1) . h(-1)) compared with the SAS group (0.091 +/- 0.036 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) 1.92 +/- 0.43 mg.kg(-1).h(-1)), respectively. BIS values exhibited a temporal correlation to SAS scores (r2 = 0.72). In conclusion, a BIS-guided regimen was more effective than a SAS-guided regimen. The use of BIS resulted in fewer remifentanil and propofol doses. The targeted BIS range of 80-85 provided a sufficient functional level of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16861420/

However, it is not known whether any parameter can identify the occurrence of awareness in individual patients. We have compared the performance of bispectral index and a new composite index derived from auditory evoked potentials and the electroencephalogram (AAI 1.61) in predicting consciousness, explicit and implicit memory during moderate sedation with propofol.
Twenty-one patients with spinal anaesthesia received intraoperatively propofol at the age-corrected C(50) for loss of consciousness and were presented test words via headphones. Bispectral index and AAI 1.61 (auditory evoked potentials, AEP-Monitor2) were recorded in parallel as well as the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation-score. Postoperatively, testing for explicit and implicit memory formation was performed.
Bispectral index and AAI 1.61 correlated well with loss of consciousness defined by an Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation-score of 2 (identical P(K) of 0.87), but did not allow a prediction of postoperative explicit or implicit recall.

Furthermore, spinal anaesthesia alone has a sedative effect. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is presumed to be decreased afferent stimulation of the reticular activating system after sympatholysis. We hypothesized that this mechanism is equally active in infants undergoing spinal anaesthesia.
In total, 20 unpremedicated former preterm infants underwent surgery under spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% 1 mg kg(-1) with epinephrine 10 microg kg(-1). No additional sedatives or anaesthetics were administered. Sedation was evaluated using the bispectral index (BIS) score and the 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF(95)).
After spinal anaesthesia, mean (SD) BIS began to decrease significantly from baseline 97.0 (1.1) to 83.9 (14.4) after 15 min (P=0.006). BIS decreased further, reaching the lowest values after 30 min [62.2 (14.0); P<0.00001]. Mean (SD) SEF(95) declined from baseline 26.1 (1.8) Hz to 24.3 (3.1) after 5 min (P=0.02) and further to 9.9 (3.8) after 30 min (P<0.00001). Mean arterial pressure also decreased significantly from 66.5 (4.7) mm Hg within 10 min to 56.1 (5.6) after spinal anaesthesia (P=0.0002), while heart rate remained stable.
These results suggest that sedation after spinal anaesthesia in infants is at least as pronounced as in adults.

The Cerebral State Index is calculated using a fuzzy logic combination of four subparameters of the electroencephalographic signal. The performance of the Cerebral State Index was compared with that of the Bispectral Index and the A-Line ARX Index.
This study applied raw data from two previously published clinical protocols. The patients in protocol 1 were given a continuous propofol infusion, 300 ml/h, until 80% of burst suppression occurred. In protocol 2, a stepwise increased target-controlled infusion of propofol was administered to patients until loss of response to noxious stimuli while the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation was registered every 4 min. The Cerebral State Index was calculated off-line from the recorded electroencephalographic data. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between electronic indices and the effect site concentration of propofol was calculated along with the prediction probability of each index to predict the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation level.
The Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the Cerebral State Index, Bispectral Index, and A-Line ARX Index and the propofol effect site concentration were -0.94, -0.89, and -0.82, respectively, in protocol 1, whereas the prediction probability values between the Cerebral State Index, Bispectral Index, and A-Line ARX Index and the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score in protocol 2 were 0.92, 0.93, and 0.91, respectively.

Levels of sedation were assessed using the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (MOAAS). EEG-measurements were performed during wakefulness, deep propofol sedation (MOAAS 2-3, mean BIS=68), and a recovery period. Between deep sedation and recovery period, the infusion rate of propofol was increased to achieve unconsciousness (MOAAS 0-1, mean BIS=35); EEG measurements of recovery period were performed after subjects regained consciousness.
During deep sedation, the physical MMN was markedly reduced, but still significant. No ERAN was observed in this level. A clear P3a was elicited during deep sedation by those deviants, which were task-relevant during the awake state. As soon as subjects regained consciousness during the recovery period, a normal MMN was elicited. By contrast, the P3a was absent in the recovery period, and the P3b was markedly reduced.
Results indicate that the auditory sensory memory (as indexed by the physical MMN) is still active, although strongly reduced, during deep sedation (MOAAS 2-3). The presence of the P3a indicates that attention-related processes are still operating during this level. Processes of syntactic analysis appear to be abolished during deep sedation. After propofol-induced anesthesia, the auditory sensory memory appears to operate normal as soon as subjects regain consciousness, whereas the attention-related processes indexed by P3a and P3b are markedly impaired.
Results inform about effects of sedative drugs on auditory and attention-related mechanisms. The findings are important because these mechanisms are prerequisites for auditory awareness, auditory learning and memory, as well as language perception during anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16807099/

SpEn and BIS were obtained continuously by Datex Ohmeda M-entropy module S/5 (Helsinki, Finland) and Aspect Medical System BIS (Newton), respectively. Total intravenous anesthesia was performed in all patients by Fresenius Vial infusion system (Brezins, France) to maintain a plasma concentration of propofol of 2.5 to 5 microg mL(-1) and sufentanil of 0.2 to 0.4 etag mL(-1). SpEn, BIS, the estimated propofol effect-site concentrations (Ce), the mean arterial pressure (MAP), and the heart rate (HR) were recorded during 12 specific events: induction of anesthesia, patient stop counting, loss of blinking reflex, intubation, mayfield pinning, craniotomy, termination of propofol infusion, recovery of blinking reflex, coughing, limb movement, order execution, and extubation. Stated that prediction probability or P(K) represents an indicator probability to predict correctly the rank order of an arbitrary pair of distinct observed indices of depth of hypnosis (ie, clinical settings and SpEn indices, or BIS, Ce, MAP, HR), PK of BIS, SE, RE, and Ce provided a better depth of hypnosis than MAP and HR; RE being the best for rapidity, SE for sensitivity, and BIS for specificity.

120 adult female patients, ASA physical status I or II, scheduled for ambulatory surgery under general anesthesia.
Patients were randomized to receive either isoflurane or sevoflurane as the maintenance anesthetic. BIS values were titrated to remain between 50 and 60 during the maintenance of anesthesia by adjusting the inspired concentration of the inhaled agent. Administration of the inhaled agent was discontinued abruptly at the end of the procedure.
The times to achieving several recovery end points were recorded. The main outcome parameter was the time to home-readiness. In the postoperative care unit, sedation was evaluated with the digit-symbol substitution test. The degree of pain and nausea was evaluated on the visual analog scale.

The elimination of implicit memory should be a necessary aim of clinical general anaesthesia. However, implicit memory cannot be tested during anaesthesia yet. We propose bispectral index (BIS) and auditory evoked potential index (AEPI), as predictors of implicit memory during anaesthesia.
Thirty-six patients were equally divided into 3 groups according to the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Score: A, level 3; B, level 2; and C, level 1. Every patient was given the first auditory stimulus before sedation. Then every patient received the second auditory stimulus after the target level of sedation had been reached. BIS and AEPI were monitored before and after the second auditory stimulus presentation. Four hours later, the inclusion test and exclusion test were performed on the ward using process dissociation procedure and the scores of implicit memory estimated.
In groups A and B but not C, implicit memory estimates were statistically greater than zero (P < 0.05). The implicit memory scores in group A did not differ significantly from those in group B (P > 0.05). Implicit memory scores correlated with BIS and AEPI (P < 0.01). The area under ROC curve is BIS > AEPI. The 95% cutoff points of BIS and AEPI for predicting implicit memory are 47 and 28, respectively.
Implicit memory does not disappear until the depth of sedation increases to level 1 of OAA/S score. Implicit memory scores correlate well with BIS and AEPI during sedation.

Pharmacologic studies of hypnotic agents have previously focused on combinations of either volatile or intravenous anesthetics. This study examined the combination of inhaled sevoflurane and intravenous propofol at these two clinically relevant anesthetic end points.
Thirty-six elective surgical patients were initially enrolled. Conditions approximating steady state were obtained for sevoflurane and target-controlled propofol infusions. Patients were sequentially evaluated for LOC (loud voice plus mild prodding) and immobility to surgical incision. The study was designed using the Dixon up-down method.
The observed propofol effect target with 50% response plus sevoflurane (0.46% end-tidal concentration) was 1.2 microg/ml (95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.3 microg/ml). It was not significantly different from that predicted (1.5 microg/ml; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.7 microg/ml) by simple additivity. The effective plasma concentration of propofol that suppressed movement to skin incision in 50% of patients was 5.4 microg/ml (95% confidence interval, 4.8-6.0 microg/ml) plus sevoflurane (0.86%) and was not significantly different from that predicted by additivity (5.4 microg/ml; 95% confidence interval, 4.8-5.9 microg/ml). Both analyses had adequate power (90%) to detect a significant change (+/-19 to 25%) from predicted value. Repeated-measures analysis of variance identified a Bispectral Index value of 70 as the break point between those who responded at LOC or did not.
Propofol and sevoflurane interact in a simple additive manner to produce LOC and immobility to surgical incision, suggesting a common mechanism or a single site of action. These clinical observations are consistent with a single site of interaction at the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16732087/

Direct comparison of different drugs' propensities for UAO may improve selection of appropriate sedating agents. The authors used the application of negative airway pressure to determine the pressure that causes UAO in healthy subjects sedated with midazolam or propofol infusions.
Twenty subjects (12 male and 8 female) completed the study. After achieving equivalent levels of sedation, the subjects' ventilation, end-tidal gases, respiratory inductance plethysmographic signals, and Bispectral Index values were monitored for 5 min. Negative airway pressure was then applied via a facemask in steps of 3 cm H(2)O from -3 to -18 cm H(2)O. UAO was assessed by cessation of inspiratory airflow and asynchrony between abdomen and chest respiratory inductance plethysmographic signals.
Equivalent levels of sedation were achieved with both drugs with average (+/- SD) Bispectral Index levels of 75 +/- 5. Resting ventilation was mildly reduced without any changes in end-tidal pressure of carbon dioxide. There was no difference between the drugs in the negative pressure resulting in UAO. Five female subjects and one male subject with midazolam and four female subjects and one male subject with propofol did not show any UAO even at -18 cm H(2)O. Compared with males, female subjects required more negative pressures to cause UAO with midazolam (P = 0.02) but not with propofol (P = 0.1).
At the mild to moderate level of sedation studied, midazolam and propofol sedation resulted in the same propensity for UAO. In this homogeneous group of healthy subjects, there was a considerable range of negative pressures required to cause UAO.

Clinical scoring systems, although simple and inexpensive, are often inadequate in evaluating the patient level of consciousness. Among instrumental tools for sedation monitoring, Bispectral Index (BIS) is now widely used due to its reliability and applicability. Nevertheless some doubts still exist regarding its usefulness in ICU.
Sedation, obtained with propofol or midazolam, was monitored with Ramsay scale and BIS in 40 patients admitted in ICU for postoperative monitoring after major abdominal or vascular surgery. A correlation between Ramsay score and BIS values was searched using Pearson test.
A good correlation between Ramsay score and BIS values was observed. At the deeper levels of sedation a wide range of BIS values corresponds to Ramsay score 6, indicating various levels of central nervous system depression that are not identified by clinical evaluation.

Clinical anaesthesiology,2006,"Tonner PH, Paris A, Scholz J","Sedation and analgesia are important components of care for critically ill patients. Avoiding over-as well as undersedation is of utmost importance as both states carry considerable risks and may influence outcome. The management of sedation has changed dramatically over the past two decades from providing a dosage level by which the patient was kept in a deep stage of anaesthesia to a current dosing strategy allowing the administration of drugs in line with individual need, resulting in most cases in a slightly sedated, cooperative patient. The importance of monitoring the level of sedation and analgesia has only recently been realised. Most importantly, regularly determining the appropriate level of sedation and analgesia as well as monitoring the desired level of sedation will help to minimise the adverse effects of sedation. Clinical sedation scales are, however, subjective, and most lack proper validation. Thus, an objective measure of sedation, such as the use of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters is desirable. Processed EEG algorithms such as the bispectral index were initially introduced into clinical practice as a tool to assess the depth of anaesthesia objectively in the operating room. However, patients under general anaesthesia differ from those in an intensive care unit. Accordingly, most results from studies evaluating the performance of processed EEG parameters in critically ill patients have not been satisfactory. At present, monitoring sedation with processed EEG parameters cannot generally be recommended. However, in special situations such as deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade, in which clinical sedation scales are prone to failure, the bispectral index may help to assess the level of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16634425/

Clinical anaesthesiology,2006,Johansen JW,"Since 1997, bispectral index (BIS; Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Natick, MA) has been in clinical practice and a wealth of experimental research has accumulated on its use. Originally, the device was approved only for monitoring hypnosis and has now received an indication for reducing the incidence of intraoperative awareness during anesthesia. Numerous studies have documented the ability of BIS to reduce intermediate outcomes such as hypnotic drug administration, extubation time, postoperative nausea and shortened recovery room discharge. Two recent large-scale outcome studies using BIS (one randomized controlled trial and one prospective, nonrandomized historical cohort study) identified an approximately 80% reduction in the incidence of recall after anesthesia. BIS provides clinicians with unique information that can be used to tailor hypnotic drug doses to individual patient requirements. BIS does not predict movement or hemodynamic response to stimulation, nor will it predict the exact moment consciousness returns. This review will also discuss other BIS applications including use in pediatrics, intensive care and for procedural sedation. Some limitations exist to the use of BIS and it is not useful for some individual hypnotic agents (ketamine, dexmedetomidine, nitrous oxide, xenon, opioids). BIS technology is moving out of the operating room and into diverse environments where conscious and deep sedation are provided. Anesthesiologists need to be actively involved in promoting patient safety and helping transition this technology into broader use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16634416/

Anesthetic depth was initially adjusted using the bispectral index to 40+/-5, and NMB was adjusted to 40%-50% of one twitch of train of four (T1) after recovery from intubation. MEPs with train of five square-wave pulses were elicited using screw electrodes placed in the skull over C3-C4. After craniotomy, the inhalational agent was introduced at 0.5 MAC and then 1.0 MAC (20 minutes each), and the effects on MEPs, NMB, and hemodynamic variables were studied. A decrease in BIS and systolic blood pressure was observed with all agents. Both SEV and ISO at 1.0 MAC significantly decreased train-of-four ratio from 38.4+/-18.1 at control to 19.0+/-9.7 and from 35.3+/-12.4 to 26.1+/-13.7, respectively (P<0.001), but not HAL at 1.0 MAC. The amplitudes of tcMEPs were significantly reduced by all agents at 1.0 MAC, with the effect being less in HAL at 0.5 MAC.

In contrast, aminophylline (3 mg.kg(-1)) was associated with an increase in BIS from 41.6 +/- 2.1 to 48.3 +/- 9.2 at five minutes after injection (P < 0.05) without affecting rSO(2).
Midazolam or isoflurane-induced decreases in the BIS during propofol anesthesia were not accompanied by a decrease in rSO(2). Aminophylline significantly increased the BIS score during propofol anesthesia, suggesting that aminophylline can antagonize, at least in part, the sedative actions of propofol.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16575034/
16571966,Spectral entropy as a measure of hypnosis in children.,Anesthesiology,2006,"Klockars JG, Hiller A, Ranta S, Talja P, van Gils MJ, Taivainen T","The Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Entropy Module (Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium Corp., Helsinki, Finland), using time-frequency balanced Spectral Entropy, is a novel tool for monitoring the hypnotic state during anesthesia. The Entropy Module produces two values, State Entropy (SE) and Response Entropy (RE), and in adults, it has been shown to measure reliably the hypnotic effects of various drugs. In children, Spectral Entropy has been only preliminary studied. The authors' aim was to study Spectral Entropy as a marker of hypnotic state during general anesthesia in infants and children.
Twenty infants (aged 1 month-1 yr) and 40 children (aged 1-15 yr) were anesthetized for surgery using standardized sevoflurane-nitrous oxide-based anesthesia. The relationships between SE, RE, or Bispectral Index (BIS) and (1) a modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale, (2) non-steady state end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane, (3) steady state end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane, and (4) hemodynamic values were calculated using prediction probability, nonlinear regression, and correlation coefficients, as appropriate. The performances of SE, RE, and BIS were compared.
The prediction probability values (+/- SEM) of SE, RE, and BIS versus the modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale in the induction phase were 0.83 +/- 0.06, 0.88 +/- 0.06, and 0.87 +/- 0.08 for children and 0.76 +/- 0.08,0.79 +/- 0.08, and 0.73 +/- 0.10 for infants; values in the emergence phase were 0.68 +/- 0.05, 0.74 +/- 0.04, and 0.64 +/- 0.05 for children and 0.64 +/- 0.07, 0.69 +/- 0.06, and 0.72 +/- 0.06 for infants, respectively. SE, RE, and BIS values were inversely proportionally related to the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane for children, but for infants, the correlation was much less clear. No significant correlations were found between SE, RE, or BIS values and the hemodynamic values.
Spectral Entropy may be a useful tool for measuring the level of hypnosis in anesthetized children and seems to perform as well as BIS. In infants, the clinical usefulness of both these electroencephalogram-derived methods must be evaluated in further controlled studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16571966/

One hundred sixty-four patients scheduled to undergo elective minor or major surgery were prospectively randomized in a multicenter study into the closed-loop (n = 83) or manual target control infusion group (n = 81). The goal was to reach a BIS target of 50 during induction and to maintain it between 40 and 60 during maintenance. For both groups, remifentanil target control infusion was adjusted manually, and ventilation was without nitrous oxide.
Closed-loop control was able to provide anesthesia induction and maintenance for all patients. During induction, propofol consumption was lower in the closed-loop group (1.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.6 mg/kg; P < 0.0001), but the duration was longer (320 +/- 125 vs. 271 +/- 120 s; P < 0.0002). Adequate anesthesia maintenance, defined as the BIS in the range of 40-60, was significantly higher in the closed-loop group (89 +/- 9 vs. 70 +/- 21%; P < 0.0001), with a decrease of the occurrence of BIS less than 40 (8 +/- 8 vs. 26 +/- 22%; P < 0.0001). Time from discontinuation of propofol infusion to tracheal extubation was shorter in the closed-loop group (7 +/- 4 vs. 10 +/- 7 min; P < 0.017). Unwanted somatic events and hemodynamic instability were similar.

We conducted an observational study comparing performance characteristics of bispectral index (BIS) and entropy monitoring systems in these patients.
Thirty-one patients of the World Federation of Neurosurgeons grades 1 and 2, undergoing embolization of cerebral artery aneurysms following acute subarachnoid haemorrhage, were recruited to have both BIS and entropy monitoring during general anaesthesia. BIS and entropy indices were matched to clinical indicators of anaesthetic depth. Anaesthetists were blinded to the anaesthetic depth monitoring indices. Analysis of data from monitoring devices allowed calculation of prediction probability (P(K)) constants, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to be performed.
BIS and entropy [response entropy (RE), state entropy (SE)] performed well in their ability to show concordance with clinically observed anaesthetic depth. P(K) values were generally high (BIS 0.966-0.784, RE 0.934-0.663, SE 0.857-0.701) for both forms of monitoring. ROC curve analysis shows a high sensitivity and specificity for all monitoring indices when used to detect the presence or absence of eyelash reflex. Area under curve for BIS, RE and SE to detect the absence or presence of eyelash reflex was 0.932, 0.888 and 0.887, respectively. RE provides earlier warning of return of eyelash reflex than BIS.

In this randomized, double-blind, controlled study we sought to demonstrate that 1% ropivacaine peribulbar (PB) block in conjunction with general anesthesia (GA) improves operative conditions and postoperative analgesia compared with GA combined with subcutaneous normal saline injection into the inferior eyelid. Thirty-one patients were included in each group. Anesthesia was performed with target-controlled infusion propofol and continuous remifentanil infusion adjusted to maintain bispectral index values between 40 and 50. Postoperative analgesia included fixed-dose IV infusion of propacetamol and IV injection of nefopam via a patient-controlled analgesia device. Tramadol was infused IV as rescue medication. Demographic data were comparable between the groups and bispectral index values were maintained at the objective target. In the PB group, fewer patients presented an oculocardiac reflex (6 versus 17; P < 0.01); bleeding interfering with the surgical field was reduced (1 versus 11 patients; P < 0.01); mean time to first nefopam request was longer (148 +/- 99 versus 46 +/- 58 min; P < 0.01); mean nefopam consumption was diminished during the first 6 h after tracheal extubation (18.9 +/- 13.9 versus 28.5 +/- 14.7 mg; P < 0.05); immediate postoperative pain scores were lower; and fewer patients required rescue medication (5 versus 23; P < 0.01).

The Bispectral Index System (BIS) is an EEG monitor that measures the anesthesia level. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of monitoring the BIS to not monitoring the BIS on time from discontinuation of GA to extubation and to discharge.
Twenty-nine children were enrolled. BIS was monitored from admission until discharge. Each child received 0.7 mg/kg of oral Versed. In the operating room, GA with sevoflurane (IH), rocuronium 1 mg/kg (IV), fentanyl 1 microg/kg (IV), and ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg (IV) was administered. Randomly, in half the patients, the anesthesiologist maintained the level of anesthesia and BIS by adjusting sevoflurane. In the rest, the anesthesiologist did not know BIS. The time from turning off sevoflurane to discharge was compared.
Group 1 patients were extubated 5+/-2 minutes sooner than group 2 patients (P=.04). The post-anesthesia care unit stay for group 1 patients was 47+/-17 minutes compared to 63+/-17 minutes in group 2. (p=0.02).

All currently available indices have different time lags to react to a change in the level of anesthesia. The aim of this study was to determine the latency of three frequently used indices: the Cerebral State Index (Danmeter, Odense, Denmark), the Bispectral Index (Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Newton, MA), and the Narcotrend Index (MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany).
Artificially generated signals were used to produce up to 14 constant index values per monitor that indicate ""awake state,"" ""general anesthesia,"" and ""deep anesthesia"" and smaller steps in between. The authors simulated loss of and return to consciousness by changing between the artificial electroencephalographic signals in a full-step and two stepwise approaches and measured the time necessary to adapt the indices to the particular input signal.
Time delays between 14 and 155 s were found for all indices. These delays were not constant. Results were different for decreasing and increasing values and between the full-step and the stepwise approaches. Calculation time depended on the particular starting and target index value.
The time delays of the tested indices may limit their value in prevention of recall of intraoperative events. Furthermore, different latencies for decreasing and increasing values may indicate a limitation of these monitors for pharmacodynamic studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16508396/

After craniofacial surgery, 22 of the 44 evaluated infants (aged 3-17 months) in the pediatric intensive care unit received propofol (2-4 mg . kg-1 . h-1) during a median of 12.5 h, based on the COMFORT-Behavior score. COMFORT-Behavior scores and Bispectral Index values were recorded simultaneously. Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling was performed using NONMEM V (GloboMax LLC, Hanover, MD).
In the two-compartment model, body weight (median, 8.9 kg) was a significant covariate. Typical values were Cl = 0.70 . (BW/8.9)0.61 l/min, Vc = 18.8 l, Q = 0.35 l/min, and Vss = 146 l. In infants who received no sedative, depth of sedation was a function of baseline, postanesthesia effect (Emax model), and circadian night rhythm. In agitated infants, depth of sedation was best described by baseline, postanesthesia effect, and propofol effect (Emax model). The propofol concentration at half maximum effect was 1.76 mg/l (coefficient of variation = 47%) for the COMFORT-Behavior scale and 3.71 mg/l (coefficient of variation = 145%) for the Bispectral Index.
Propofol clearance is two times higher in nonventilated healthy children than reported in the literature for ventilated children and adults. Based on the model, the authors advise a propofol dose of 30 mg/h in a 10-kg infant to achieve values of 12-14 on the COMFORT-Behavior scale and 70-75 on the Bispectral Index during the night.

A computer search of English-language articles in MEDLINE (1966-July 2005), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1971-July 2005), and Scientific Citation Index Expanded (1980-July 2005) was conducted. A manual search of abstracts was also performed using the key search terms BIS, sedation, and critical care.
Case series, letters, editorials, and clinical studies that evaluated BIS in ICU patients were considered for inclusion.
Nineteen studies comparing the BIS with sedation scales were evaluated, revealing that the BIS trends lower with increasing sedation. The BIS appeared to correlate better when sedation scores were grouped rather than individual values. However, correlations between BIS and subjective scales were low in most studies (r(2) 0.21-0.93). Additionally, there was poor correlation between drug dosage and the BIS. Randomized, controlled trials demonstrating improved outcomes with BIS monitoring have not been reported.
Interpreting literature on the usefulness of the BIS in the ICU is difficult for reasons that include heterogeneous populations, different methods of collecting BIS data, and use of different versions of BIS software and hardware. Outcomes data are lacking. The 2002 Society of Critical Care Medicine Sedation Guidelines recommendation that more data are needed before the BIS should be used routinely in the ICU remains unchanged. We recommend that further studies be conducted to determine the optimal method of obtaining BIS data and evaluate the impact of the BIS on relevant patient outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16492796/

Following the approval of Institutional Review Board and informed parental consent, 28 children with ages ranging between 4 and 16 years with ASA physical status I and II , undergoing elective lower abdominal and genitourinary surgery were included in this study. Patients were randomized and separated into two subgroups. Before induction of anesthesia, patients were monitored for BIS. Epidural injection of 30 microg.kg(-1) morphine in 1 ml.kg(-1) saline for the first group (group M) and the same volume of (0.25%) bupivacaine for second group (group B) were administered via the sacral hiatus. We analyzed serum cortisol and glucose concentrations for evaluation of the stress response in the patients. Blood samples for cortisol and glucose were withdrawn at the beginning of induction (first samples), 40 min after surgical incision (second samples), and 40 min after end of the surgery (third samples). BIS scores of the patients were kept between 40 and 60 during the surgical procedure.
Group B had significantly lower levels of cortisol than group M in the second samples. There was a significant increase in serum glucose level in group M compared with group B during the intraoperative and postoperative periods.

Nine human volunteers received three escalating drug concentrations: 0.2, 0.4 and 1.0 MAC end-tidal inhalation. During waking, baseline and the three levels of sedation, aO PET scan was performed.
Isoflurane decreased the bispectral index (BIS) values dose-dependently. Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were maintained constant over time. No significant change in global CBF was observed. Throughout all three MAC levels of sedation, isoflurane caused an increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the anterior cingulate and decreased rCBF in the cerebellum. Initially, isoflurane (0 vs. 0.2 MAC) significantly increased relative rCBF in the medial frontal gyrus and in the nucleus accumbens. At the next level (0.2 vs. 0.4 MAC), relative rCBF was significantly increased in the caudate nucleus and decreased in the lingual gyrus and cuneus. At the last level (0.4 vs. 1 MAC), relative rCBF was significantly increased in the insula and decreased in the thalamus, the cuneus and lingual gyrus. Compared with flow distribution in awake volunteers, 1 MAC of isoflurane significantly raised relative activity in the anterior cingulate and insula regions. In contrast, a significant relative flow reduction was identified in the thalamus, the cerebellum and lingual gyrus.
Isoflurane, like sevoflurane, induced characteristic flow redistribution at doses of 0.2-1.0 MAC. At 1 MAC of isoflurane, rCBF decreased in the thalamus.

Bispectral index monitoring has been separately examined and validated during both mild and moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. However, the effect on bispectral index of these two differing cardiopulmonary bypass temperature regimes has not previously been compared, particularly with the use of volatile anaesthetic agents.
Following Institutional Ethics Committee approval and informed consent, 30 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting had additional bispectral index monitoring. Sixteen patients had mild hypothermic bypass (32-34 degrees C), and 14 had moderate hypothermic bypass (28-30 degrees C). Anaesthesia was standardized, and was maintained with enflurane throughout surgery. Scores were recorded at 14 specific event-related time points during surgery.
This study has demonstrated that in this adult population, a relationship exists between bispectral index score and temperature throughout the duration of cardiac surgery, which included mild or moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. It also demonstrated that patients which were categorized as having received moderately hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass had lower bispectral index scores than those patients who received mild hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, at time points corresponding approximately with median steady-state bypass temperature, pre-re-warming and early re-warming periods.
Moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass has lower bispectral index scores when compared to mild hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, at a steady state of inspired enflurane. This may reflect an actual increase in the depth of hypnosis.

Prospective, controlled study in a university hospital affiliated intensive care unit.
Seventeen surgical patients undergoing elective esophagectomy.

Neuromuscular block reduced the BIS during moderate sedation but not during deep sedation although the EMG at both levels of sedation was significantly reduced. No positive effects of neuromuscular block on cerebral hemodynamics were obtained with monitoring of regional cerebral oxygen saturation and middle cerebral artery blood velocity; however, significant effects on systemic hemodynamic parameters were observed only at moderate propofol sedation. The values of BIS and systemic hemodynamic variables with moderate sedation were also very similar to those with deep sedation and neuromuscular block although these values differed without neuromuscular block.
Neuromuscular block altered the BIS score in moderately sedated patients but not in deeply sedated patients although cerebral hemodynamics was not affected by neuromuscular block during either moderate or deep sedation. Muscular relaxant also enhanced cardiovascular stability with moderate sedation.

Traditionally, subjective scales have been used for monitoring sedation. Bispectral index has been proposed, although its utility in the intensive care unit is debated. Our aim was to evaluate the depth of sedation in intubated surgical critically ill patients by means of two sedation scales (Ramsay and Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation) and bispectral index.
Sedation was assessed prospectively in 50 postoperative intubated patients requiring at least 24 h of sedation (35 propofol, 15 midazolam/fentanyl), every 8 h for a 24 -h period. The bispectral index value recorded was the mean value obtained during a 10-min observation period, whenever the quality signal index was above 75% and the electromyographic signal was below 25%.
Most of the patients (78%) were oversedated (bispectral index < 60). The three sedation scores (global data) correlated significantly (P < 0.001). This correlation was lost in the midazolam group in which the patients were also significantly more sedated than the propofol group (P = 0.001). The correlation between the bispectral index and the scales in the midazolam group reappeared when the measurements with a Ramsay = 6 or an Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation = 1 were excluded.

In this study we compared 3 sedation tools in children from birth to 18 yr of age and determined their relative value in detecting deep levels of sedation. Bispectral index monitoring (BIS), Modified Maintenance of Wakefulness Tests (MMWT), and the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) were used to assess sedation. Three-hundred-twenty-seven observations were recorded in 39 children. The overall validity of each measure was supported by appropriate changes after sedation administration through the observation period. There were moderate to high correlations between UMSS and BIS (rho = -0.73) and UMSS and MMWT (rho = -0.59; P < 0.01). The correlation between BIS and MMWT was significant but low (r = 0.36; P < 0.01). Measures of exact agreement supported the reliability of the UMSS and MMWT across the sedation continuum. There were significant decreases in BIS across UMSS scores except from scores 2-3. ROC curves suggested that BIS < or = 80 and MMWT < or = 14 min were most sensitive in delineating deep sedation. Our findings demonstrate the overall validity of these observational and objective measures of sedation depth in children <18 yr of age but show ongoing limitations distinguishing moderate from deep sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16428530/

We tested the hypothesis that the BIS score is a valid measure of the depth of pediatric sedation in a study designed to avoid limitations of a previously published report. BIS values from 96 healthy ASA physical status I-II children aged 1-12 yr undergoing sedation were continually recorded and electronically transferred to a computer. Two independent observers blinded as to BIS score evaluated sedation using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) and the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) at 3-5 min intervals. There was a significant correlation between BIS and UMSS and between BIS and OAA/S by both the Spearman's rank correlation test and by prediction probability (P < 0.001). In children <6 yr, there was a significant correlation between BIS and the clinical sedation scores for subgroups undergoing invasive and noninvasive procedures (P < 0.001). There was also good agreement between the 2 independent observers who assessed clinical sedation scores (kappa = 0.51, P < 0.001).

Recent anecdotal reports suggest that incremental sublingual dosing of triazolam may be an effective technique for producing conscious sedation in the dental setting. Although promising, no laboratory or clinical data have been available to evaluate the efficacy or safety of this approach. This study was designed to determine the pharmacokinetics and sedative effects of incremental sublingual dosing of triazolam (total, 1.0 mg) in healthy adults. Ten healthy adult volunteers received sublingual triazolam (0.25 mg) followed by additional doses after 60 (0.50 mg) and 90 (0.25 mg) minutes. Plasma triazolam concentrations, clinical effects (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score), and processed electroencephalogram (bispectral index score) were measured intermittently for 3 hours. Plasma triazolam concentrations (mean +/- SD, 5.1 +/- 1.1 ng/mL) and drug effects (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score, 2 +/- 1; and the bispectral index score, 62 +/- 16) were greatest in all subjects at the end of the 3-hour evaluation period. Eight of the subjects had Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scores consistent with the definition of deep sedation or general anesthesia (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score, <3) at some of the later time points in the 180 minutes of data collection. In comparison, 4 of the subjects had bispectral index scores less than 60 during these later time points of data collection.

We evaluated the variation of pulse plethysmography amplitude induced by an electrical tetanic stimulus (PPG variation) as a potential measure for analgesia and predictor of haemodynamic responsiveness during general anaesthesia.
Ninety-five patients, ASA I or II, were randomly assigned to five groups [Group 1: bispectral index (BIS) (range) 40-50, effect site remifentanil concentration 1 ng ml(-1);Group 2: BIS 40-50, remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1); Group 3: BIS 40-50, remifentanil 4 ng ml(-1); Group 4: BIS 25-35, remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1); Group 5: BIS 55-65, remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1)]. A 60 mA tetanic stimulus was applied for 5 s on the ulnar nerve. From the digitized pulse oximeter wave recorded on a laptop computer, linear and non-linear parameters of PPG variation during the 60 s period after stimulation were computed. The haemodynamic response to subsequent orotracheal intubation was recorded. The PPG variation was compared between groups and between responders and non-responders to intubation (anova). Variables independently predicting the response were determined by logistic regression.
The probability of a response to tracheal intubation was 0.77, 0.47, 0.05, 0.18 and 0.52 in Groups 1-5, respectively (P<0.03). The PPG variability was significantly higher in responders than in non-responders but it did not improve the prediction of the response to tracheal intubation based on BIS level and effect site remifentanil concentration.

However, its clinical effect remains unknown. We investigated whether an increased dosage of propofol reduces responses to LMA insertion. Sixty adult patients were divided into 3 groups according to induction dosage of propofol (2.0 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg). The patient's responses including body movement and the upper airway reflex were observed. The bispectral index (BIS) score as the index of the sedation level was monitored. There were no significant differences among the three groups in responses to LMA insertion, and no correlation was seen between the BIS score and the responses. These results suggest that propofol alone at clinical dosage levels does not completely control responses to LMA insertion. It is also suggested that the monitoring of BIS score is not effective in predicting responses to LMA insertion. Combination of propofol and analgesics such as fentanyl may be useful in reducing responses to LMA insertion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21302218/

In the Control group (n = 25), sevoflurane and fentanyl were titrated according to standard clinical practice. In the BIS-directed group (n = 25), sevoflurane was titrated to maintain a BIS value between 50 and 60, and supplemental fentanyl, 25 mug iv boluses were administered to treat tachypnea. The intraoperative anesthetic and analgesic requirements, as well as the times to eye opening, removal of the laryngeal mask airway device, response to simple commands, orientation to person and place, and postanesthesia care unit discharge eligibility (fast-track score of 14) were assessed at specific time intervals.

Our aim was to investigate the role of using the bispectral index (BIS) in recovery from anesthesia and altering drug administration in patients undergoing craniotomy. Fifty American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) physical status I-II patients undergoing craniotomy were included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, and all patients received standard induction drugs, and 0.8%-1.5% sevoflurane was used for maintenance of anesthesia. In the BIS-guided group, the concentration of sevoflurane was titrated to maintain BIS at 40-60. In the control group, the anesthesiologist was blind to BIS, and the concentration of sevoflurane was changed according to the patients' hemodynamic changes. The hemodynamic data, BIS values, and sevoflurane concentrations were recorded every 15 minutes. In addition, the BIS value was recorded by the primary anesthetist in the BIS-guided group and by another independent anesthetist in the control group. At the end of the study, recovery criteria and Aldrete recovery scores were recorded every 15 minutes. Neurologic assessments were performed when the Aldrete score was 9-10. BIS values were higher, and sevoflurane concentrations (P < 0.05) and total doses of fentanyl (P < 0.01) were lower, in the BIS-guided group. Times to first spontaneous breathing, eye opening, and extubation (P = 0.035, P = 0.001, and P = 0.0001, respectively) were significantly shorter in the BIS-guided group. Time to an Aldrete score of 9-10 and adequate neurologic assessment were similar between the groups.

We performed a subset analysis comparing recovery characteristics from general anesthesia combined with neuromuscular blocking drugs of female and male patients, at risk of awareness, enrolled in a large trial testing the effectiveness of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. We used multivariate statistical methods to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics, duration and extent of surgery, and anesthetic drug administration in 1079 patients (584 male, 495 female). Female patients had higher BIS values than male patients despite similar amounts of anesthetic drug administration (time-averaged mean [sd] BIS: male 44.6 [7.1] versus female 46.4 [6.6]; P = 0.005). Time to eye opening after anesthesia and time to eligibility to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit were less in women than men (male 13.9 [13.2] min versus female 10.6 [11.6] min; P < 0.001; male 133 [209] min versus female 78 [106] min; P < 0.001, respectively). These differences persisted after multivariate adjustment (both P < or = 0.001). Gender has an independent effect on recovery times in patients undergoing general anesthesia combined with neuromuscular blocking drugs, with women recovering faster than men. Higher BIS values during maintenance of anesthesia in women, despite similar amounts of anesthetic drug administration, suggests that women are less sensitive to the hypnotic effect of anesthetic drugs than men and may help explain faster recovery times in women.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16368846/

We designed this clinical study to test the hypothesis that use of the spectral entropy (Entropy) module is associated with less frequent intraoperative interference with the displayed indices than the bispectral index (BIS) monitor when used during general anesthesia with propofol and desflurane. Thirty consenting patients scheduled for major laparoscopic surgery procedures were enrolled in this prospective study. The elapsed time to obtain a baseline index value was recorded, as well as the simultaneous state entropy (SE), response entropy (RE), and BIS values at specific time intervals during the induction, maintenance, and emergence periods in patients administered a standardized general anesthetic technique. During the maintenance period, the changes in these indices were evaluated after a bolus dose of propofol (20 mg IV) and a 2% increase or decrease in the inspired concentration of desflurane. As expected, the baseline SE values were less than the RE and BIS values (88 +/- 2 versus 96 +/- 3 and 96 +/- 4, respectively). However, the SE and RE values correlated with the BIS value during the induction (r = 0.77 and 0.78, respectively) and emergence (r = 0.86 and 0.91, respectively) periods. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detection of consciousness also indicated a similar performance of the SE (0.93 +/- 0.04) relative to the RE (0.98 +/- 0.04) and BIS (0.97 +/- 0.04). During the maintenance period, the responses to changes in propofol and desflurane concentrations were consistent with all three indices. Finally, the entropy indices were less interfered with by the electrocautery unit during the operation (12% versus 62% for the BIS monitor). Because the average selling prices of the Entropy and BIS disposable electrode strips (14.25 dollars versus 14.95 dollars USD, respectively) are comparable, we conclude that the Entropy module is a cost-equivalent alternative to the BIS monitor.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16368823/

Dexmedetomidine, an alpha2 receptor agonist, has analgesic and sedative properties that might be helpful in the management of ED. We studied the effects of a continuous perioperative infusion of 0.2 microg.kg(-1).h(-1) dexmedetomidine on the incidence of ED in 50 children aged 1-10 years scheduled for sevoflurane-based GA.
Following inhalation induction of GA, the children were randomly assigned into dexmedetomidine or placebo Groups D and S, respectively. The infusion of 0.2 microg.kg(-1).h(-1) dexmedetomidine or equal volume of saline was started after securing the airway. Depth of anesthesia was maintained by adjusting the concentration of sevoflurane to achieve a Bispectral Index Score of 40-60. Intraoperative hemodynamics were recorded every 5 min and the trachea was extubated at the end of the procedure. Perioperative pain management was determined by the blinded anesthesia team, and the study drug infusion was maintained for 15 min following the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) admission.

One hundred twenty-one patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery (89 coronary patients, 24 valve replacement patients, and 8 valve replacement and coronary surgery).
Patients were divided into 3 groups. An observing anesthesiologist recorded on a special form (""parallel"" anesthesia record) data from the devices of the workstation and the BIS monitor. Conditions in which BIS monitoring was subjectively considered that might have been useful in anesthetic decision making were recorded as ""events."" In group A (36 patients), the responsible anesthesiologist had continuous access to BIS information. In group B (44 patients), intraoperative anesthetic management was ""blinded"" to BIS values, whereas in group C (41 patients), the anesthesiologist observing the BIS monitor was free to inform the attending anesthesiologist about the BIS score. The number of events was considered as negatively reflecting the quality of the clinical course of a patient. The reduction of events was considered as improvement in decision making. All patients received the same anesthetic regimen (propofol + remifentanil). Monitoring was equal in all cases. Mild hypothermic CPB was applied in 73 patients. Statistical analysis used 1-way analysis of variance, Student 2-tailed t test, and chi2 analysis.
Patient demographic data, underlying pathology, operation performed, hypothermia application, times of anesthesia, duration of operation, and CPB were similar in the 3 groups. In group B, the BIS value was considered by the observer as useful to know in 220 events (5.00 +/- 1.58 per patient). In group C, the BIS value was considered by the observer as useful to know in 143 events (3.49 +/- 1.31 per patient, P < 0.001) and, at the same time, the attending anesthesiologist was informed about BIS. In 112 (78.3%) cases, measures were taken. Titration of anesthetic drugs was done in 79 (70.5%) patients, whereas titration of vasoactive drugs was done in 9 (8.0%) patients, titration of both in 13 (11.6%) patients, and other diagnostic or corrective actions in 11 (9.8%) patients. Distributions of BIS values did not differ statistically (39.19 +/- 10.32, 37.38 +/- 10.21, and 38.29 +/- 10.01 in group A, group B, and group C, respectively). ""Zenith"" and ""nadir"" BIS values after induction also did not differ statistically. Awakening and extubation times were similar in both groups.
Subjectivity, although reduced as much as possible, can play a confining role in the value of our results. The usefulness of BIS monitoring is shown by the fact that BIS data resulted in corrective measures.

The objective of this study was to assess the degree of correlation between the COMFORT scale and the BIS monitor.
A prospective study in a tertiary level PICU.
A total of 75 children were enrolled in the study, resulting in 869 valid paired observations of BIS values and COMFORT scores. The median age was 10 months, with a range of 1 month to 12 yrs. The median COMFORT score was 11 (range, 8-40). The median BIS value was 52 (range, 0-98). In a repeated-measures analysis, the correlation coefficient between COMFORT scores and BIS values averaged over time was 0.61 (p < .0001).
The BIS monitor may be a valid and useful monitor of the level of sedation of children in the PICU. We cannot expect perfect correlation between BIS values and observational scales because they measure different variables. The BIS monitor may be the best objective monitor currently available for children receiving neuromuscular blockade because it does not rely on subjective measures such as those used in the COMFORT scale. The ability of the BIS monitor to distinguish between very deep levels of sedation may be useful to prevent over-sedation of children in PICUs and to help clarify the appropriate target level of sedation for each child.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16276329/

Thereafter, propofol or sevoflurane was started again (loss of consciousness), and surgery was performed. Return of consciousness was observed after surgery. The electroencephalogram and AEP from immediately before and after the transitions were selected. Logistic regression was calculated to identify models for the separation between consciousness and unconsciousness. For the top 10 models, 1,000-fold cross-validation was performed. Backward variable selection was applied to identify a minimal model. Prediction probability was calculated. The digitized electroencephalogram was replayed, and the Bispectral Index was measured and accordingly analyzed.
The best full model (prediction probability 0.89) contained 15 AEP and 4 electroencephalographic parameters. The best minimal model (prediction probability 0.87) contained 2 AEP and 2 electroencephalographic parameters (median frequency of the amplitude spectrum from 8-30 Hz and approximate entropy). The prediction probability of the Bispectral Index was 0.737.
A combination of electroencephalographic and AEP parameters can be used to differentiate between consciousness and unconsciousness even in a very challenging data set. The minimal model contains a combination of AEP and electroencephalographic parameters and has a higher prediction probability than Bispectral Index for the separation between consciousness and unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16249666/
16249665,Investigation of implicit memory during isoflurane anesthesia for elective surgery using the process dissociation procedure.,Anesthesiology,2005,"Iselin-Chaves IA, Willems SJ, Jermann FC, Forster A, Adam SR, Van der Linden M","This prospective study evaluated memory function during general anesthesia for elective surgery and its relation to depth of hypnotic state. The authors also compared memory function in anesthetized and nonanesthetized subjects.
Words were played for 70 min via headphones to 48 patients (aged 18-70 yr) after induction of general anesthesia for elective surgery. Patients were unpremedicated, and the anesthetic regimen was free. The Bispectral Index (BIS) was recorded throughout the study. Within 36 h after the word presentation, memory was assessed using an auditory word stem completion test with inclusion and exclusion instructions. Memory performance and the contribution of explicit and implicit memory were calculated using the process dissociation procedure. The authors applied the same memory task to a control group of nonanesthetized subjects.
Forty-seven patients received isoflurane, and one patient received propofol for anesthesia. The mean (+/- SD) BIS was 49 +/- 9. There was evidence of memory for words presented during light (BIS 61-80) and adequate anesthesia (BIS 41-60) but not during deep anesthesia (BIS 21-40). The process dissociation procedure showed a significant implicit memory contribution but not reliable explicit memory contribution (mean explicit memory scores 0.05 +/- 0.14, 0.04 +/- 0.09, and 0.05 +/- 0.14; mean automatic influence scores 0.14 +/- 0.12, 0.17 +/- 0.17, and 0.18 +/- 0.21 at BIS 21-40, 41-60, and 61-80, respectively). Compared with anesthetized patients, the memory performance of nonanesthetized subjects was better, with a higher contribution by explicit memory and a comparable contribution by implicit memory.
During general anesthesia for elective surgery, implicit memory persists even in adequate hypnotic states, to a comparable degree as in nonanesthetized subjects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16249665/

Due to the possible presence of residual postoperative neuromuscular blockade after surgery, a processed electroencephalograph (EEG) was applied prior to starting sedation. This was markedly abnormal in all three cases, and not in keeping with the residual anesthesia. The patients were immediately transported for a CT scan. In all three cases there was severe neurological injury incompatible with survival and end of life decisions were made. Although the utility of quantitative EEG technology, like the Bispectral index (BIS) or Patient State Analyzer (PSA), is becoming better defined in the operating room, the role in the ICU is less clear. We propose that the ICU use of the PSA 4000 may have affected our decision weighing the risk versus benefit of transporting a fresh postoperative case to the radiology suite, expedited the neurological diagnosis, and may have reduced overall ICU resource utilization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16244845/

We compared the performance of the CSI to the bispectral index (BIS) in measuring depth of anaesthesia during target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol.
Twenty Chinese patients undergoing general anaesthesia were recruited. CSI and BIS, and predicted effect-site concentration of propofol were recorded. The level of sedation was tested by Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAAS) every 20 s during stepwise increase (TCI, 0.5 microg ml(-1)) of propofol. The loss of verbal contact (LVC) and loss of response (LOR) were defined by MOAAS values of 2-3 and less than 2, respectively. Baseline variability and the prediction probability (P(K)) were calculated for the BIS and CSI. The values of BIS(05) and CSI(05), BIS(50) and CSI(50), BIS(95) and CSI(95) were calculated at each end-point (LVC and LOR).
Baseline variability of CSI was more than that of BIS. Both CSI and BIS showed a high prediction probability for the steps awake vs LVC, awake vs LOR, and LVC vs LOR, and good correlations with MOAAS values.
Despite larger baseline variation, CSI performed as well as BIS in terms of P(K) values and correlations with step changes in sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16210310/

A total of 110 women undergoing hysterectomy were randomly allocated to receive either music or no music. Propofol was administered using target-controlled infusion and the concentration adjusted gradually to achieve an observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score of 3 intra-operatively. The haemodynamic and bispectral index values during the sedation phase were recorded. Interleukin-6 was evaluated before, immediately after and 1 h following intervention. The music group had a significant reduction in mean (SD) induction time of sedation: 12 (12) min vs. 18 (12) min, p < 0.01; propofol target concentration: 1.6 (0.3) microg.ml(-1) vs. 2.4 (0.4) microg.ml(-1), p < 0.0001; intra-operative amount of propofol: 171 (98) mg vs. 251 (92) mg, p < 0.0001; and significantly higher levels of satisfaction with their peri-operative care: 9.6 (0.6) compared to the control group: 8.1 (1.0), p < 0.0001.

Actually MAC is the first choice in 10-30% of all the surgical procedures. The 3 fundamental elements and purposes of a conscious sedation during a MAC are: a safe sedation, the control of the patient anxiety and the pain control. The patients undergoing conscious sedation are able to answer to orders appropriately and to protect airways. Last but not least, another purpose of any MAC is to get the patient appropriately satisfied, allowing him to get his discharge as faster as possible. There are many surgical procedures which can be performed using a MAC. The patient consciousness evaluation is of extreme importance during the surgical procedure performed with MAC: to this purpose the clinical and electroencephalographic evaluations such as Bispectral Index are very useful. MAC can be obtained with the association of fast half-life drugs or drugs getting a clinical effect which can vary according to the surgical requirements, using an infusion regiment. Apart from the pharmacological choice, this procedure can be performed with patient controlled sedation techniques or with continued intravenous infusion or with target controlled infusion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16166913/

Anxiety (as measured by the Stait-Trait Anxiety Inventory), arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were assessed before and after the intervention and a Bispectral Index monitor was used to continuously monitor hypnotic sedation levels. Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that parents in the acupressure group reported significantly less anxiety at 20 min post-intervention as compared with parents in the sham group (37 +/- 10 versus 45 +/- 13, P = 0.03). Bispectral Index values, heart rate, and arterial blood pressure, however, did not differ between the two study groups (P = not significant).

We evaluated 15 children with negative clinical findings and a normal electroencephalogram (EEG) as part of their follow-up for prior episodes of epilepsy, recording the BIS and EEG in a waking state, in the various stages of sleep and on reawaking. For each stage, the mean value, the standard deviation, and the range of BIS values were calculated. The results showed that the BIS decreased progressively as sleep became deeper.

Forty-one healthy, unpremedicated pediatric patients scheduled for elective operations received either halothane or sevoflurane titrated as appropriate for surgical stimulation.
During maintenance sevoflurane anesthesia (n=20), the mean BIS values and percent end-tidal concentrations were 44+/-14 and 2.1+/-0.6, respectively, whereas for the halothane group (n=21) the corresponding values were 61+/-7 and 1.1+/-0.4, respectively.

Sixty patients undergoing right colic resection were studied. Patients were randomized to receive prior to general anesthesia a 2-mL intrathecal (IT) injection of 300 microg of clonidine or saline, or 10 mg of bupivacaine. General anesthesia was achieved using a target concentration propofol infusion and monitored using bispectral index. Postoperative analgesia was provided by morphine IV given through a patient-controlled analgesia device. Postoperative analgesia was assessed by morphine requirements and visual analog scale pain scores at rest, cough, and movement during the first 72 h. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured by von Frey filaments. Patients were questioned regarding residual pain at 2 wk,1, 6, and 12 mo. The patient-controlled analgesia morphine requirements were significantly smaller in the IT clonidine group (31.5 +/- 12 versus 91 +/- 25.5 and 43 +/- 15 mg, respectively, in groups clonidine, saline, and bupivacaine: P < 0.05 at 72 postoperative hours). The area of hyperalgesia at 72 h was 3 +/- 5 cm(2) in the clonidine group versus 90 +/- 30 and 35 +/- 20 cm(2) in the saline and bupivacaine groups (P < 0.05). At 6 mo, fewer patients in the clonidine group experienced residual pain than in the saline group (0 of 20 versus 6 of 20, P < 0.05). We conclude that both intraoperative spinal clonidine and bupivacaine improve immediate postoperative analgesia. IT clonidine was, however, more potent than IT bupivacaine to reduce postoperative secondary hyperalgesia.
Spinal clonidine contributes to the reduction of secondary hyperalgesia in patients recovering from abdominal surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16037177/

Meanwhile, a number of studies indicate that with total IV anesthesia, BIS and Narcotrend have comparable effects on drug consumption and recovery times whereas comparative clinical data for volatile anesthetics are still missing. Therefore, we designed the present prospective, randomized, and double-blinded study to compare the effects of BIS and Narcotrend monitoring during desflurane-remifentanil anesthesia and versus a standard anesthetic practice protocol. One-hundred-twenty adult patients scheduled for minor orthopedic surgery were randomized to receive a desflurane-remifentanil anesthetic controlled either by Narcotrend or by BIS or solely by clinical variables. Anesthesia was induced with 0.4 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) remifentanil and 2 mg/kg propofol. After tracheal intubation, remifentanil was infused at a constant rate of 0.2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) whereas desflurane in 1.5 L/min O(2)/air was adjusted according to clinical variables or the following target values: during maintenance of anesthesia to a value of ""D(0)"" (Narcotrend) or ""50"" (BIS), 15 min before the end of surgery to ""C(1)"" (Narcotrend) or ""60"" (BIS), whereas in the standard protocol group, desflurane was controlled according to clinical variables, e.g., heart rate, arterial blood pressure, movements. Recovery times and desflurane consumption were recorded by a blinded investigator. The desflurane vaporizer was weighed before and after anesthesia and consumption per minute was calculated. Data are mean +/- sd. The groups were comparable for demographic data, duration of anesthesia, and mean remifentanil dosages. Compared with standard practice, patients with Narcotrend or BIS monitoring needed significantly less desflurane (standard practice 443 +/- 71 mg/min, Narcotrend 374 +/- 124 mg/min, BIS monitoring 416 +/- 99 mg/min desflurane [both P < 0.05]). However, recovery times were not significantly different between the groups, e.g., opening of eyes 4.7 +/- 2.2 versus 3.7 +/- 2.0 versus 4.2 +/- 2.1 min. During desflurane-remifentanil anesthesia, Narcotrend and BIS monitoring seem to be equally effective compared with standard anesthetic practice: BIS and Narcotrend allow for a small reduction of desflurane consumption whereas recovery times are only slightly reduced.
Monitoring the electroencephalogram with Narcotrend or Bispectral Index during desflurane-remifentanil anesthesia only slightly reduces recovery times when compared with a standard practice protocol.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16037157/

In this study, we induced 30 surgical patients with 4 mg/kg thiopental IV, and 30 patients with 2 mg/kg propofol IV. Thereafter, the occurrence of yawning was continuously assessed, as the only clinical end-point, for 1 min. The electroencephalographic bispectral index was monitored throughout the observation period. The criterion for an arousal response was a transient increase during a continuing decrease in the bispectral index value. On the basis of this criterion, the sensitivity and specificity of the yawning response as an arousal sign were 77% and 80%, respectively. If a patient exhibited a yawning response, the chance of arousal was 84% (positive predictive value). With no yawning response, the chance of nonarousal was 71% (negative predictive value). According to simple logistic regression, the yawning response was predictive of a transient arousal-shift with an odds ratio of 13.5 (95% confidence interval: 3.8-48; P < 0.001). The occurrence of a yawning response during IV induction may be a clinical indicator of a transient arousal-shift during progressive loss of consciousness.
Yawning elicited by IV anesthetic induction was related to a transient increase during the continuing decrease in the electroencephalographic bispectral index value (sensitivity and specificity, 77% and 80%, respectively).

In this study, we examined the effect of gender on the hypnotic requirement for loss of consciousness (LOC) using either a volatile (sevoflurane) or an IV (propofol) anesthetic. One-hundred-fifteen unpremedicated, ASA physical status I-II patients, aged 18-40 yr old, received either sevoflurane by mask to a predetermined end-tidal concentration (%ET(sevo)) or propofol by target-controlled infusion (effect site) while breathing spontaneously. After sufficient time for equilibration, LOC was assessed by lack of response to mild prodding. The up-down method of Dixon was used to determine the hypnotic target concentration at 50% response (LOC(50)). No statistically significant difference in LOC(50) was noted between men and women for sevoflurane (0.83% +/- 0.1% and 0.92% +/- 0.09% ET, respectively). Men required significantly more propofol than women (2.9 +/- 0.2 versus 2.7 +/- 0.1 microg/mL, respectively). However, there was no difference in the bispectral index (BIS) at LOC for men or women with either hypnotic anesthetic. This investigation identified a small, statistically significant difference in hypnotic requirement at LOC(50) between men and women with propofol but not with sevoflurane. As defined by BIS, men and women had equivalent hypnotic states at LOC(50), indicating that gender had no clinically significant effect on hypnotic requirements. However, BIS at a defined clinical end-point (LOC(50)) was significantly different between the sevoflurane and propofol groups, suggesting that neurophysiological effects of these anesthetics may be different.
Gender affects the dosing requirements for, and response to, many drugs used in anesthetic practice. Loss of consciousness is an early clinical marker of hypnotic drug effect. We found no significant difference to either an inhaled (sevoflurane) or IV (propofol) anesthetic related to patient gender.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16037147/

Changes in BIS values > or = 30% from previous readings were evaluated to determine whether or not concomitant changes of > or = 10% in autonomic variables, in the same direction, coexisted. Forty-seven patients (35 male and 12 female) were enrolled in our study; ages ranged from 10 days to 18 years (mean, 4.2 +/- 6.2 years [+/- SD]). Twenty-five patients were < 1 year of age (53%). All patients were sedated and pharmacologically paralyzed. Overall, 387 BIS readings (15%) showed a > or = 30% change from the previously documented BIS number. These BIS changes were in agreement with heart rate (HR) changes, mean arterial pressure (MAP) changes, and both HR and MAP changes in 10.6%, 23.8%, and 5.7% of the time, respectively. The same analysis of agreement was done for patients < or = 1 year old, and results were no different from those of older patients. Among 21 patients who were not receiving any vasoactive drugs (alpha- and/or beta-adrenergic agonists) during the study period, 157 BIS recordings (15%) showed a > or = 30% change from the previously documented BIS number. The percents of agreement with HR, MAP, and HR and MAP for these patients were 14.6%, 17.2%, and 7.6%, respectively.

Agreement with MAP was significantly better than with HR for this group of patients (p < 0.05; Fisher Exact Test).
While significant changes in BIS are thought to reflect significant changes in depth of sedation, they have a very low rate of agreement with changes in vital signs.

Ten healthy volunteers (aged 21-37 yr) participated on two occasions and in random order received placebo or propofol infusions. Standard monitoring and radial artery blood pressure were combined with measurement of forearm blood flow (plethysmography) and derivation of forearm vascular resistance, recording of peroneal nerve sympathetic activity, and blood sampling for norepinephrine concentrations. A computer-controlled infusion pump delivered placebo or two concentrations of propofol, adjusted to achieve moderate and deep sedation based on the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score (responsiveness component) of 4 and 3. Level of sedation was quantitated using bispectral analysis of the electroencephalogram. Baroreflexes were assessed with a hypotensive challenge via administration of sodium nitroprusside.
Baseline neurocirculatory and respiratory parameters did not differ between sessions. Progressive infusions to achieve moderate and deep sedation resulted in average Bispectral Index values of 70 and 54, respectively. Propofol significantly reduced sympathetic nerve activity at both levels of sedation and decreased norepinephrine and forearm vascular resistance at deep sedation. These effects resulted in significant decreases in mean blood pressure of 9% and 18% at moderate and deep sedation, respectively. Propofol also reduced reflex increases in sympathetic nerve activity.
These data from healthy subjects indicate that sedation doses of propofol, which did not compromise respiratory function, had substantial inhibitory effects on sympathetic nerve activity and reflex responses to hypotension resulting in vasodilation and significant decreases in mean blood pressure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15983452/

Patients evaluated for surgery to control a seizure disorder undergo Wada testing, during which one hemisphere is rendered functionally inactive after injecting a short-acting barbiturate. We surmised that the BIS values would reflect these functional changes. Eight epileptic patients were enrolled. A full array of 21 EEG electrodes and 2 BIS XP (Quatro) strips over each frontal region of the scalp were applied. The EEG was continuously recorded. BIS values from each hemisphere were recorded every minute. Angiography was performed by advancing a catheter into each internal carotid artery. Amobarbital or methohexital was injected until the patient developed a hemiparesis. The EEG confirmed a significant lateralized cortical effect of the barbiturate. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze the differences between the BIS values from monitor electrode strips placed on the left (left BIS) and the right (right BIS) sides of the head as well as the differences in the left and right BIS values before and after each injection of the barbiturate. Injection of barbiturate into either the left or right internal carotid artery produced a significant change on the 21-electrode EEG. However, there was no difference between left BIS to right BIS values (P = 0.84). With repeated injections of barbiturates, some patients became sedated.

Fifty patients were included in the study. Patients were premedicated with midazolam and were randomly divided into two groups. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (7-15 microg/kg), with either propofol (2 - 2.5 mg/kg, Group I) or midazolam (0.1 - 0.3 mg/kg, Group II) and vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg). Anaesthesia was maintained with fentanyl (15 microg/kg/h) together with either propofol (6 mg/kg/h) or midazolam (0.1 mg/kg/h). Depth of anaesthesia was adjusted according to clinical signs and haemodynamic responses. The level of sedation was monitored with Bispectral index continuously, but these levels were not shown to the attending anaesthetist. Bispectral index values were recorded for nine phases. Twenty-four hours after the operation, the patients were interviewed to determine intraoperative awareness and recall.
In all patients, Bispectral index values were found to decrease after induction (in Group I, p = 0.005, in Group II, p = 0.008) with the mean values remaining below 60 for all phases. The differences between the groups were not statistically significant in inter-group comparison. No patients were noted to recall the sounds presented during the operation and the preoperative events.
BIS monitoring with clinical signs may be used to assess the adequacy of both types of anaesthesia techniques as well as to detect awareness during off-pump CABG surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15957626/

To examine the role of a previously described core algorithm ""COVER ABCD-A SWIFT CHECK"", supplemented by a specific sub-algorithm for awareness, in the detection and management of potential awareness in association with general anaesthesia.
The potential performance of this structured approach for each of the relevant incidents among the first 4000 reported to the Australian Incident Monitoring Study (AIMS) was compared with the actual management as reported by the anaesthetists involved.
Of the first 4000 reports received by AIMS, there were 21 incidents of patient awareness under general anaesthesia, and 20 of patients being paralysed while awake from ""syringe swaps"" before induction of anaesthesia. In 12 of the 21 reports there was an obvious cause, most commonly a low concentration of volatile agent (8 of 12 reports). The AIMS ""core"" crisis management algorithm would have detected the cause of awareness in all of these cases. In nine reports the course of anaesthesia appeared unremarkable, and in these the algorithm would not have been expected to detect or prevent awareness. Volatile agent monitoring would have prevented some cases of awareness, as would bispectral index electroencephalographic (BIS) monitoring. The role of BIS monitoring is still contentious, but it should be considered for high risk patients.

This was a prospective, single-intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with propofol between December 28, 2002, and October 31, 2003. BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status. At 1-minute intervals during the procedural sedation, until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure, a word from a standardized list was read aloud, and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator. The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient's ability to repeat the word were recorded. After the procedure, the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall, and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed.
Seventy-five consenting patients were enrolled; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation. No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations. The mean (+/-standard deviation) time of data collection was 16.4 minutes (+/-7.1; range 5 to 34 minutes). The mean initial (preprocedure) BIS score was 97.1 (+/-2.3; range 92 to 99).

Multiphase clinical trial.
Outpatient treatment center of a university children's hospital.
Pediatric outpatients undergoing painful medical procedures.
Patients were sedated with propofol for the procedures. Patients were monitored with a BIS monitor, and the BIS score was correlated with the patient's clinical level of sedation. The BIS score was then used as a guide to titrate propofol in the last phase of the study.
The study consisted of 3 phases. In a chart review of data for 154 children who underwent 212 procedures, propofol was found to be safe and effective, with consistent dosing among the intensivists administering the medication. The children received a mean bolus dose of propofol of 1.56 mg/kg, with a mean total dose of propofol of 0.33 mg/kg per minute for the duration of the procedure. In the second phase, 21 patients ranging in age from 27 weeks to 18 years, with normal neurologic function, were sedated with propofol. An observer who was blinded to the BIS scores recorded clinical levels of sedation and reactivity (with a modified Ramsay scale and reactivity score) every 1 to 3 minutes. Another observer recorded the BIS scores at the same times. A total of 275 data points were collected and evaluated. All data points from the times at which patients were considered to be sedated adequately were used to construct a normal distribution of BIS scores. The mean BIS score was 62. This distribution was used to predict that a maximal BIS score of 47 was needed to ensure adequate sedation for 90% of the population. In the third phase of the study, an algorithm was devised to determine the target BIS score necessary for adequate sedation of 95% of the patients. We chose an initial BIS score of 50 (at which 85% of the patients in phase 2 were sedated) because of the possibility of data from phase 2 being skewed toward oversedation. Propofol was administered by an intensivist in an attempt to maintain the target BIS score. A blinded observer noted the patient's clinical level of sedation. In this group, there were 2 failures, ie, patients were clinically uncomfortable despite a BIS score of < or =50, representing only 90% success. Therefore, with the algorithm, propofol was titrated to sedate the next patients to a BIS score of 45. These patients required a mean bolus dose of 1.47 mg/kg and a mean total dose of 0.51 mg/kg per minute to maintain a BIS score of 45. They awakened in 12.75 minutes. All patients were sedated adequately, all procedures were successful, and no patients experienced complications from the sedation. To eliminate variability in the way propofol was dosed, the next 10 patients were given propofol according to a standardized protocol. These 10 children received an initial bolus of 1 mg/kg, with incremental bolus doses of 0.5 mg/kg per dose (maximum: 20 mg) to achieve and to maintain a BIS score of 45. With this protocol, all patients were sedated adequately and none experienced complications from the sedation. The patients required a mean bolus dose of 2.23 mg/kg and a mean dose of 0.52 mg/kg per minute to maintain a BIS score of 45. The mean time until awakening was 14.9 minutes. Regarding the total dose over time and the time until awakening, there was no statistical significance between this group and the group sedated to a BIS score of 45 without the dosing protocol.

Although the BIS has been extensively studied in the operating room setting, differences in patient populations, goals of treatment, and the environments themselves necessitate the development of BIS data specific to the intensive care unit. Data have evolved over the last several years, but for many reasons, the results and conclusions have varied. Yet within the data are important consistencies that help define the usefulness of BIS in patients who cannot be evaluated with subjective assessment tools such as the Sedation-Agitation Scale or the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Some of these patients cannot be evaluated with such tools because they lack motor responsiveness due to therapeutic paralysis or because they are receiving deep sedation. Bispectral index scores that are higher than expected in clinically sedated patients can often be traced to electromyographic activity or to the possibility of inadequate sedation and analgesia. The BIS must not be regarded as the sole indicator of level of consciousness, but should be used as part of an integrated approach to the evaluation of carefully selected patients with critical illness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15899745/
15891425,Novel monitoring techniques for use with procedural sedation.,Current opinion in pediatrics,2005,"Levine DA, Platt SL","A variety of pharmacologic agents used for procedural sedation in children to reduce pain and anxiety may produce respiratory depression and hypotension. Although standard monitoring guidelines include oxygen saturation, this measurement is limited as a guide to respiratory function. This review discusses two new monitoring techniques recently introduced to the pediatric emergency department that facilitate procedural sedation and reduce potential adverse effects of the medications administered.
Capnography via an end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor measures carbon dioxide concentrations during ventilation. This measurement is independent of oxygen saturation and thereby aids the clinician in identifying hypoventilation and apnea in the sedated patient at an earlier stage than conventional monitoring. The bispectral index monitor objectively measures the depth of sedation by analyzing electroencephalogram signals from a cutaneous probe. This tool enables the physician to titrate sedative medications to a desired effect and thereby reduce the risks associated with oversedation.
Studies have illustrated the use of both devices as adjuncts to current standard monitoring of children in the outpatient setting. These modalities will facilitate the efficacy of procedural sedation in children and improve safety by enabling early recognition of hypoventilation and by reducing the risk of oversedation in children undergoing procedural sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15891425/

Prospective audit, pilot study.
Single-institution university medical center.
Adult patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (N = 45).
Forty-five patients undergoing aortic valve surgery with an ejection fraction of more than 30% were included in this prospective audit. Induction of anesthesia was done using fentanyl, 2 to 4 mug/kg, propofol, 1 to 2 mg/kg, and endotracheal intubation facilitated by rocuronium; anesthesia was maintained using sevoflurane titrated according to bispectral index (BIS [BIS target: 50]). Perioperative analgesia was provided by high thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA group, bupivacaine 0.125%, 6 to 14 mL/h) or fentanyl, up to 10 microg/kg, followed by patient-controlled analgesia with morphine (OPIOID group).
Success of extubation within 30 minutes after surgery was recorded. Hemodynamic data during surgery were compared by using an analysis of variance test; p < 0.05 was considered as showing a significant difference. Data presented as median (25th-75th percentile). In the TEA group, patients underwent simple aortic valve replacement (N = 21) or combined aortic valve surgery (N = 14), with additional coronary artery bypass grafting (N = 10) and replacement of the ascending aorta (Bentall, N = 4). In the OPIOID group, patients underwent simple aortic valve replacement (N = 5) or combined aortic valve surgery (N = 5), with additional aortocoronary bypass grafting (N = 2), replacement of the ascending aorta (Bentall, N = 2), and reconstruction of the mitral valve (N = 1). All 45 patients were extubated within 15 minutes after surgery. There was no need for reintubation; pain scores were lower in the TEA group than in the OPIOID group immediately after surgery and at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after surgery.

Every EP should approach PSA as a complex procedure requiring high-level skills and knowledge. Initially, understand that PSA represents a spectrum of goals, from anxiolysis and pain relief to deep sedation. Assess the needs of the patient and the concomitant procedure and set goals accordingly. There is a pharmacopia of drugs that provide sedation and analgesia. Become familiar with their pharmacology, advantages and disadvantages, and indications. This will allow for appropriate usage and achievement of sedation goals. Several drugs that are commonly used for general anesthesia are proving themselves to be safe and efficacious for PSA. Both etomidate and propofol have emerged as useful drugs for PSA. Continued research and practice with these agents will add to our understanding and help define their use for PSA. Performing PSA as a procedure itself requires preparedness, diligent monitoring, and risk awareness. Knowing the patient's comorbid state and choosing agents that will not exacerbate their baseline status minimize risk. Following fasting guidelines is appropriate in certain clinical situations, and is prudent when time permits. However, these guidelines are a benchmark for minimizing risk and are not supported by evidence-based medicine. It is important to be cognizant of the guidelines but also to identify the emergency scenario where action must be taken despite the fasting guidelines. Controlling sedation depth also minimizes the risk of aspiration and other complications. The ETCO2 monitor and Bispectral Index may prove to be useful adjuncts for monitoring sedation depth. However, there is nothing yet that measures sedation depth quantitatively that can replace the qualitative assessment of the EP. More and more PSA is falling under the domain of the EP. It is important for the EP to be involved in hospital policy and guidelines associated with this procedure, and to remain aware of new research in this field. EPs can thereby contribute to quality assurance throughout the medical community by setting a standard in the practice of PSA, as they are not the only practitioners using this procedure.

The newer algorithm BIS XP did not perform better than the previous version BIS in patients after major surgery who were mechanically ventilated and sedated on an intensive care unit. This precludes the use of BIS or BIS XP for distinguishing, among deeply sedated ICU patients, those with and without preserved cerebral electrical activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15753750/
15749735,Magnesium sulphate only slightly reduces the shivering threshold in humans.,British journal of anaesthesia,2005,"Wadhwa A, Sengupta P, Durrani J, Akça O, Lenhardt R, Sessler DI, Doufas AG","Hypothermia may be an effective treatment for stroke or acute myocardial infarction; however, it provokes vigorous shivering, which causes potentially dangerous haemodynamic responses and prevents further hypothermia. Magnesium is an attractive anti-shivering agent because it is used for treatment of postoperative shivering and provides protection against ischaemic injury in animal models. We tested the hypothesis that magnesium reduces the threshold (triggering core temperature) and gain of shivering without substantial sedation or muscle weakness.
We studied nine healthy male volunteers (18-40 yr) on two randomly assigned treatment days: (1) control and (2) magnesium (80 mg kg(-1) followed by infusion at 2 g h(-1)). Lactated Ringer's solution (4 degrees C) was infused via a central venous catheter over a period of approximately 2 h to decrease tympanic membrane temperature by approximately 1.5 degrees C h(-1). A significant and persistent increase in oxygen consumption identified the threshold. The gain of shivering was determined by the slope of oxygen consumption vs core temperature regression. Sedation was evaluated using a verbal rating score (VRS) from 0 to 10 and bispectral index (BIS) of the EEG. Peripheral muscle strength was evaluated using dynamometry and spirometry. Data were analysed using repeated measures anova; P<0.05 was statistically significant.
Magnesium reduced the shivering threshold (36.3 [SD 0.4] degrees C vs 36.6 [0.3] degrees C, P = 0.040). It did not affect the gain of shivering (control, 437 [289] ml min(-1) degrees C(-1); magnesium, 573 [370] ml min(-1) degrees C(-1); P=0.344). The magnesium bolus did not produce significant sedation or appreciably reduce muscle strength.
Magnesium significantly reduced the shivering threshold. However, in view of the modest absolute reduction, this finding is considered to be clinically unimportant for induction of therapeutic hypothermia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15749735/
15741580,The utility of the bispectral index in procedural sedation with propofol in the emergency department.,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,2005,"Miner JR, Biros MH, Seigel T, Ross K","The bispectral index (BIS) may be a useful monitor to predict the level of awareness in patients undergoing procedural sedation in the emergency department (ED).
The authors hypothesized that using the BIS during procedural sedation in the ED would increase the recognition of adequately sedated patients, thus reducing oversedation and the corresponding increased rate of respiratory depression (RD). As a result, the occurrence of RD would be reduced.
This was a prospective randomized study of ED procedural sedation with propofol. Sedations were randomized to have the treating physician either blinded or not blinded to information from the BIS monitor. Vital signs, pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)), propofol dosage, and the BIS score were recorded. RD was defined as a change in ETCO(2) greater than 10 mm Hg, an oxygen saturation of less than 90% at any time, or an absent ETCO(2) waveform. The RD rates were compared with chi-square tests.
One hundred five patients were enrolled in the study; five were excluded due to study protocol violations. No serious adverse events were reported. RD was seen in 29 of 100 (29%) patients; 18 of 48 in the BIS-blinded group and 11 of 52 in the BIS-unblinded group had RD (p = 0.06). For patients requiring only a single dose of propofol, three of 15 in the BIS-blinded group and four of 18 in the BIS-unblinded group met the criteria for RD (p = 0.87). For patients requiring multiple doses of propofol, 15 of 33 patients in the BIS-blinded group and seven of 34 patients in the BIS-unblinded group met criteria for RD (p = 0.02). The mean BIS nadir for BIS-blinded patients was 60.9 (95% CI = 56.9 to 65.0) and that for BIS-unblinded patients was 63.2 (95% CI = 57.7 to 65.3) (p = 0.22).
There was a lower rate of RD when physicians had access to the BIS during procedural sedations. This difference was greater in sedations requiring multiple doses of propofol. There was no difference in the rate of RD when only a single dose was given.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15741580/

Forty-five patients were randomly assigned to the control, esmolol, and landiolol groups (n = 15 each). Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in oxygen, with an end-tidal concentration maintained at 1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC). Infusion of saline (control group), esmolol (bolus of 1 mg/kg and then 0.25 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1); esmolol group), or landiolol (bolus of 0.125 mg/kg and then 0.04 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1); landiolol group) was started 5 min after the induction of anesthesia and was continued throughout the study. Tracheal intubation was performed 12 min after anesthesia induction. There were no differences in overall changes of mean arterial blood pressure among the three groups, whereas, at 1-5 min after tracheal intubation, heart rate increased in all groups but was significantly slower in the esmolol and landiolol groups than in the control group (P < 0.05). BIS was between 96 and 98 for all patients at baseline and decreased during the induction of anesthesia. There were no differences in BIS among the three groups before laryngoscopy (39 +/- 5, 39 +/- 5, and 38 +/- 4 in the control, esmolol, and landiolol groups, respectively). BIS increased significantly in the control group (54 +/- 10; P < 0.05) 1 min after intubation, whereas it remained unchanged in the esmolol and landiolol groups (45 +/- 10 and 41 +/- 6, respectively). In conclusion, the increase in both heart rate and BIS after tracheal intubation under 1 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia was suppressed by the concomitant administration of either esmolol or landiolol.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15728061/

Present propofol lipid formulations have well known undesirable properties, for example, pain on injection and increased triglyceride concentrations. We investigated whether GPI 15715 is suitable to achieve and maintain moderate sedation for 2 h. Six male and six female volunteers received a target-controlled infusion of GPI 15715, with an initial propofol target concentration of 1.8 microg/mL and the possibility to adjust the propofol target once after 1 h. Propofol concentrations, the bispectral index, and modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAA/S) scores were monitored. The median MOAA/S score was 4 during the first hour and was 3 during the second hour of infusion. The propofol target had to be changed to 2.4 microg/mL in seven volunteers and to 3.0 microg/mL in two volunteers. A propofol concentration of 1.9 microg/mL had the highest probability to result in an MOAA/S score of 3, which corresponds with moderate sedation. We observed no serious side effects.

However, this approach is prone to error. Inadequate monitoring of sedation and analgesia may contribute to adverse outcomes and complications. With this in mind, data obtained continuously using nonstimulating methods such as bispectral index (BIS) may have benefits in comparison with clinical monitoring of sedation. The aim of this prospective observational trial was to evaluate the use of electroencephalographic (EEG) BIS for monitoring sedation in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients.
Forty paediatric patients (<18 years) were sedated for mechanical ventilation in a cardiac surgical and general PICU. In each paediatric patient BIS and COMFORT score were obtained. The study protocol did not influence ongoing PICU therapy. BIS and corresponding COMFORT score were collected three times for each patient. Measurements with the best starting EEG impedances were analyzed further. Deep sedation was defined as a COMFORT score between 8 and 16, and light sedation as a score between 17 and 26. Biometric and physiological data, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality III scores were also recorded.
There was a good correlation (Spearman's rho 0.651; P = 0.001) between BIS and COMFORT score in the presence of deep sedation and low starting impedance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed best discrimination between deep and light sedation at a BIS level of 83.

15692924,"Preparation, premedication, and surveillance.",Endoscopy,2005,"Lazzaroni M, Bianchi Porro G","In the year since the last review, continuing pressure on endoscopy suites to improve efficiency and reduce costs without compromising patient care has led to growing interest in alternatives to pharmacological sedation and in the use of short-acting sedatives. Relaxation music, acupuncture, and the use of small-caliber endoscopes for unsedated peroral gastroscopy have therefore been suggested as ways of increasing tolerance and reducing discomfort. With regard to ultrathin and superthin endoscopes, the results are interesting, but further data from controlled trials and in studies including larger numbers of patients are still needed. The form of sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy that has attracted greatest interest over the last year is the use by nonanesthetists of intravenous propofol, administered either alone at standard doses to achieve deep sedation, or at lower doses combined with benzodiazepines and opioids to achieve moderate sedation/analgesia. In comparison with benzodiazepines/opioids, the results were in favor of propofol: the mean time to sedation was shorter and the depth of sedation was greater. In addition, patients receiving propofol reached full recovery earlier and were discharged sooner. However, in the survey of patient satisfaction at discharge, it was found that the sedation methods did not have a significant impact on overall patient satisfaction. Some important issues concerning the narrow therapeutic range of propofol and the need for adequate training of endoscopists to deal with any problems related to deep sedation are still open - despite the growing amount of data suggesting that the drug is safe even when administered by registered nurses, an approach that is possibly more cost-effective than delivery by gastroenterologists or anesthetists. The morbidity and mortality associated with cardiopulmonary complications continue to be a significant concern during gastrointestinal endoscopy. Professional societies and national expert peer groups have issued practice guidelines for sedation and analgesia that call for continuous monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic and ventilatory status and consciousness. Direct observation is facilitated by electronic devices (pulse oximetry, capnography), directly indicating the patient's ventilatory status and the depth of sedation. Recently, it has been proposed that the bispectral index (BIS), an electroencephalography-based technique, can be used to monitor the depth of sedation during gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, the results of a recent study cast some doubt on the usefulness of the BIS, in its current version, for titrating boluses of propofol to an adequate level of sedation. Further data therefore appear to be needed to assess whether or not BIS values can help avoid unnecessary propofol dosage and can replace continuous assessment of the ventilatory effort.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15692924/

Anaesthesia was induced with either an intravenous infusion of 30 mg kg(-1)h(-1) of propofol plus 2 microg kg(-1) of fentanyl (Group PF, n = 20) or an intravenous infusion of 30 mg kg(-1) h(-1) of propofol plus normal saline (Group P, n = 20). BIS, AAI and the doses of propofol administered were recorded at the end-point of unresponsiveness to verbal commands. The propofol plasma concentration was also measured.
The propofol dose and plasma propofol concentration required to achieve loss of consciousness were significantly lower in patients pretreated with fentanyl (P < 0.001). The mean BIS value at loss of consciousness was significantly different between the two groups (74.10 in Group PF vs. 60.80 in Group P) (P < 0.001). However, no difference in the AAI was seen between the two groups at loss of consciousness (32.90 in Group PF vs. 31.80 in Group P) (P > 0.05). In both groups, the regression analysis values (r-values) between BIS and plasma propofol concentrations at the onset of unconsciousness were higher than those between AAI and propofol concentrations (0.553 vs. 0.180 in Group P; 0.432 vs. 0.308 in Group PF).
These results show that a fentanyl bolus is effective in augmenting the hypnotic effect of propofol during anaesthesia induction. AAI appears to be able to measure the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness at similar values, regardless of whether or not fentanyl pretreatment is used whereas the BIS values were not independent of fentanyl pretreatment. This suggests that AAI may be a better indicator of conscious status during propofol/fentanyl anaesthesia, where it appears to be independent of the anaesthesia regimen.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15678736/

This study was conducted to assess changes in bispectral index (BIS) caused by increasing the target propofol effect-site concentration during a target-controlled infusion (TCI) in major burns.
Eighteen patients, ASA physical status 2 or 3, aged from 20 to 55 years old, weighing 50-70 kg, with major burns, scheduled for elective early escharectomy less than a week after injury were recruited. A further 18 ASA physical status class 1 or 2, non-burns, age, sex- and weight-matched adult patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia were recruited as controls. During anesthesia induction, target propofol effect-site concentrations were increased by increments of 0.5 microg ml(-1) up to 4.5 microg ml(-1). The BIS responses to each target concentration using TCI were compared in both groups.
In the burns group, significantly greater BIS values relating to increasing propofol TCI were noted at deeper anesthesia when compared with controls; at > or =3.5 microg ml(-1); mean BIS remained at a plateau of about 50. Patients with burns had higher cardiac indices, and lower hemoglobin and albumin concentrations than the controls. They consumed more vecuronium to maintain the same degree of neuromuscular blockade than the controls.
In major burns, the final biphasic BIS responses appeared to be determined by numerous other variables such as BIS algorithm, TCI performance, and altered propofol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. According to our results the importance of an individually tailored approach, including careful anesthetic titration, based upon the patient's clinical condition and responses can not be overemphasized.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15675988/

The Entropy algorithm quantifies the degree of disorder in the EEG. During anaesthesia the disorder of the EEG, or entropy, falls. Entropy is independent of absolute frequency or amplitude of the EEG. This may make it suitable for paediatric anaesthesia. In this prospective observational blinded study we recorded the Entropy and Bispectral Index in 23 children undergoing general anaesthesia with isoflurane and nitrous oxide, supplemented with peripheral nerve blockade. We recorded Entropy at several times during anaesthesia, pre-awakening and 1-minute post-awakening. Entropy pre-awakening and 1 minute after awakening was compared to a value during anaesthesia in three age groups; less than one-year-old (infants), one to five years (toddlers) and five to twelve years (children). The correlation between BIS and Entropy was also calculated. Entropy post-awakening was higher than during anaesthesia for all age groups. Entropy pre-awakening was higher than during anaesthesia for the children and toddlers. This was not as apparent in infants. There was a strong correlation between BIS and Entropy for children and toddlers. The correlation was less for infants. This study demonstrates that, in children, Entropy is lower during anaesthesia when compared to awake values.

Target concentrations of blood propofol were randomly set at 0.5 microg/ml, 1.0 microg/ml, 1.5 microg/ml, and 2.0 microg/ml, with a fixed fentanyl infusion rate between 0.5 microg.kg(-1).h(-1) and 1.5 microg.kg(-1).h(-1).
Depth of sedation was subjectively assessed with the Ramsay Sedation Score. The aepEX was recorded using an auditory evoked potentials system. The bispectral index and SEF95% were measured using an Aspect A-1000 monitor.
The aepEX, bispectral index, and SEF95% correlated with the Ramsay Sedation Score, the Pk value being greatest for the aepEX, followed by the bispectral index. All three variables could predict opening of the eyes in response to verbal commands or a glabellar tap, the aepEX being a better predictor than the bispectral index or SEF95%. All three EEG variables had Pk values >0.5 in predicting coughing or movement in response to tracheal suction, but they were unable to predict increases in heart rate or systolic blood pressure.
The aepEX was the best predictor, followed by bispectral index. Although in most intensive care patients subjective sedation scales are sufficient to assess levels of sedation, the aepEX and bispectral index were potential alternatives to subjective scales when they do not work well in the setting of neuromuscular blockade or may not be sufficiently sensitive to evaluate very deep sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15650862/

Hypnotic state fluctuations, stress, and variable amnesic qualities of commonly used anesthetics could account for this effect.
The authors replicated the trauma investigation in 90 elective surgical patients to enable anesthetic titration to a bispectral index value of 50-55 during auditory presentation of word stimuli. Patients were randomly assigned to maintenance with propofol (n = 48) or isoflurane (n = 42). Before surgery, state anxiety and trait anxiety were assessed using self-report measures. Postoperative memory assessment relied on the process dissociation procedure using a word stem completion task.
There were no differences between groups for relevant demographic, preoperative, or supplemental drug variables. Ninety-eight percent of words were presented within a bispectral index range of 40-60, with values averaging 48.8 (SD = 5.7) during word presentation. Neither the process dissociation procedure nor standard measures of conscious recall and recognition memory showed evidence of explicit or implicit memory. Preoperative stress levels did not correlate with postoperative memory test scores in either study group.
In contrast to the results of their previous study, the authors found no evidence of memory function with close control of hypnotic state. This suggests that hypnotic state fluctuations are important to memory activation under anesthesia. Other variables may contribute to preserved memory function as well.

SE, RE, BIS, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and sedation level were recorded every 20 s during stepwise increase (target-controlled infusion, 0.5 microg/ml) of propofol until the patients lost response. Five minutes after loss of response, remifentanil infusion (0.4 microg . kg(-1) . min(-1)) was started. Spearman correlation coefficient and prediction probability were calculated for sedation levels with SE, RE, BIS, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate. The ability of the investigated parameters to distinguish between the anesthesia steps awake versus loss of response, awake versus anesthesia, anesthesia versus first reaction, and anesthesia versus extubation was analyzed with the prediction probability.
SE correlates best with sedation levels, but no significant differences of the prediction probability values among SE, RE, and BIS were found. The prediction probability for all investigated steps of anesthesia did not show significant differences among SE, RE, and BIS. SE, RE, and BIS were superior to mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate.
SE, RE, and BIS revealed similar information about the level of sedation and allowed the authors to distinguish between different steps of anesthesia. Both monitors provided useful additional information for the anesthesiologist.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15564934/

Similarly, at MAC-awake, 50% of subjects respond appropriately to command. The bispectral index (BIS) nominally measures the effect of anesthetics on wakefulness or consciousness. We postulated that the use of halothane with a larger MAC-awake/MAC ratio than sevoflurane would produce higher BIS values at comparable levels of MAC. We studied 33 unpremedicated patients anesthetized by inhalation, 18 with sevoflurane and 15 with halothane. We measured BIS before and during anesthesia at 1 MAC, both before and after tracheal intubation facilitated by fentanyl and rocuronium and then at 1.5 MAC. BIS measurements were made after meeting steady-state conditions. No surgery was performed during this study. BIS values in awake patients did not differ between the sevoflurane and halothane groups (96 +/- 2 and 96 +/- 2, mean +/- sd, respectively). At 1 MAC without and with neuromuscular blockade and at 1.5 MAC, BIS values for patients anesthetized with halothane (54 +/- 7, 56 +/- 7, and 49 +/- 7, respectively) exceeded those for patients anesthetized with sevoflurane (34 +/- 6, 34 +/- 6, and 29 +/- 5, respectively) (P < 0.0001). This finding adds to other evidence indicating that BIS is drug specific.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15562061/

However, no study has evaluated the effect of local anesthetics on all three components of balanced anesthesia, i.e., hypnosis, analgesia, and muscle relaxation. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we investigated the effect of epidural bupivacaine on the dose requirement of propofol (as evaluated by using the bispectral index [BIS]), fentanyl, and vecuronium for general anesthesia. This study consisted of 30 adults, ASA physical status I and II, undergoing Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary carcinoma lasting >4 h. An epidural catheter was placed between T9-10. Depending on the group allocation, 10 mL of the study drug was administered as a bolus followed by an infusion at 6 mL/h via the epidural catheter. Patients were divided into 2 groups of 15 each. Patients in the control group received epidural normal saline whereas those in the bupivacaine group received epidural bupivacaine 0.1%. Induction of anesthesia was performed with IV fentanyl 2 mug/kg and propofol titrated to achieve BIS between 40-50. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by the IV administration of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg and patient's lungs were ventilated with 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen. After intubation, infusion of propofol 1% was titrated to maintain BIS between 40-50. Inadequate analgesia was defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure and/or heart rate by >20% of baseline values in response to surgical stimulus and was treated with bolus fentanyl 0.5 mug/kg. Neuromuscular monitoring was used to assess the need for additional doses of vecuronium. Data were analyzed by using the Student's t-test and P </= 0.05 was considered significant. The requirement of propofol for induction and maintenance of anesthesia in the bupivacaine group was 1.3 +/- 0.3 mg/kg and 2.4 +/- 0.9 mg . kg(-1) . h(-1), respectively, compared with 2.4 +/- 0.6 mg/kg and 4.4 +/- 1.6 mg . kg(-1) . h(-1) observed in the control group (P < 0.05). Significant reduction was also observed in the requirement of vecuronium and fentanyl during maintenance in the bupivacaine group (P < 0.05). We conclude that epidural bupivacaine given before induction of anesthesia reduces the requirement of propofol, fentanyl, and vecuronium during general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15562054/

One hundred patients undergoing sedo-analgesia (midazolam and fentanyl) for interventional gastrointestinal procedures were divided into two groups. In group A (n=30) sedation was guided by the RSS with the operator blinded to the BIS recording. In group B (n=70) the operator titrated intravenous sedation to maintain an optimal BIS, predetermined from the results in group A. Recovery time, procedure duration, physiological parameters and unplanned events were recorded in both groups.
There was a significant correlation between the BIS and RSS (p<0.001). BIS values of 87.2 and 80.9 corresponded to an RSS of 3 and 4, respectively. The optimal BIS level was defined as 80-85. Fifty-seven point five percent of readings were within this range in group B compared with 26.5% in group A (p<0.001). Sedation approaching general anaesthesia (BIS<60) occurred in 5.5% of patients in group A but not in group B. Mean recovery time, duration of procedure, midazolam and fentanyl doses were significantly reduced in group B. Unplanned events were reduced from 27 to 17%, but this was not statistically significant (p=0.29).
BIS monitoring enables more effective titration of sedatives to maintain a suitable level of consciousness, whilst reducing procedure time. The BIS offers an objective, safe and reliable measure of sedation, without disturbing either patient or operator. BIS monitoring raises the standard of patient care, and in our view, should be used to augment standard assessment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15556593/

Forty women undergoing elective lower abdominal surgery received a propofol target controlled infusion (TCI) to maintain a modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score of 2 (sedation period). Subsequently anesthesia was induced with propofol TCI 5 mug.mL(-1) and rocuronium 0.9 mg.kg(-1), and propofol continued so as to maintain general anesthesia at a BIS of 50 (general anesthesia period). Intravenous epinephrine at a dose of 10 mug.5 mL(-1) in normal saline (epinephrine group, n = 20) or normal saline 5 mL (control group, n = 20) was administered during both periods. The BIS, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured immediately before, and one, two, three, four, six, eight, and ten minutes after injection. The modified OAA/S scale was evaluated during the sedation period.
There was no significant change in the modified OAA/S scale, BIS, or hemodynamic variables compared to preinjection values during either sedation or general anesthesia in the control group. Intravenous epinephrine increased the BIS and modified OAA/S scale during sedation, but there was no increase in BIS during general anesthesia. Increases in HR and MAP were observed during both periods after iv epinephrine.
Intravenous epinephrine 10 mug resulted in an arousal effect and an increase in BIS during sedation, but did not change the BIS during general anesthesia. These results suggest that the arousal effect of iv epinephrine during propofol anesthesia depends on anesthetic depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15525612/

The authors used five different rates of propofol administration to test the hypothesis that different sedation endpoints occur at the same effect site propofol concentration, independent of the infusion rate. The authors concurrently evaluated the automated responsiveness monitor (ARM) against other sedation measures and the propofol effect site concentration.
With Human Studies Committee approval, 18 healthy volunteers received five consecutive target-controlled propofol infusions. During each infusion, the effect site concentration was increased by a rate of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, or 0.9 microg . ml . min. The Bispectral Index and ARM were recorded at frequent intervals. The times of syringe drop and loss and recovery of responsiveness were noted. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling was performed using NONMEM.
When the correct rate of plasma-effect site equilibration was determined for each individual (plasma-effect site equilibration = 0.17 min, time to peak effect = 2.7 min), the effect site concentrations associated with each clinical measure were not affected by the rate of increase of effect site propofol concentration. ARM correlated with all clinical measures of drug effect. Subjects invariably stopped responding to ARM at lower effect site propofol concentrations than those associated with loss of responsiveness.
: Population-based pharmacokinetics, combined with real-time electroencephalographic measures of drug effect, may provide a means to individualize pharmacodynamic modeling during target-controlled drug delivery. ARM seems useful as an automated measure of sedation and may provide the basis for automated monitoring and titration of sedation for a propofol delivery system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15505446/

This study compared the respiratory effect of dexmedetomidine to that of remifentanil. The authors measured and compared respiratory responses of six healthy male volunteers during (1) a stepwise target-controlled infusion of remifentanil, (2) a stepwise target-controlled infusion of dexmedetomidine, and (3) a pseudonatural sleep session.
Compared with baseline, remifentanil infusions resulted in respiratory depression as evidenced by a decrease in respiratory rate and minute ventilation, respiratory acidosis, and apnea episodes resulting in desaturations. Remifentanil disturbed the natural pattern of breathing and flattened the distribution of ventilatory timing (inspiratory time/ventilatory cycle time). The respiratory effects of dexmedetomidine markedly contrasted with those of remifentanil. When compared with baseline, during dexmedetomidine infusions, the respiratory rate significantly increased, and the overall apnea/hypopnea index significantly decreased. The distribution of inspiratory time/ventilatory cycle time showed an increased peak. In addition, dexmedetomidine seemed to mimic some aspect of natural sleep. While the subjects were breathing a 5% CO2 mixture, hypercapnic arousal phenomena (documented by the Bispectral Index, the electroencephalogram, and sudden increase in the minute ventilation) were observed during dexmedetomidine infusions. Similar phenomena during natural sleep have been reported in the literature.

Nine healthy human volunteers received three escalating doses using 0.4%, 0.7% and 2.0% end-tidal sevoflurane inhalation. During baseline and each of the three levels of anaesthesia one PET scan was performed after injection of . Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were monitored and electroencephalography and bispectral index (BIS) were registered.
Sevoflurane decreased the BIS values dose-dependently. No significant change in global cerebral blood flow (CBF) was observed. Increased regional CBF (rCBF) in the anterior cingulate (17-21%) and decreased rCBF in the cerebellum (18-35%) were identified at all three levels of sedation compared to baseline. Comparison between adjacent levels sevoflurane initially (0 vs. 0.2 MAC) decreased rCBF significantly in the inferior temporal cortex and the lingual gyrus. At the next level (0.2 MAC vs. 0.4 MAC) rCBF was increased in the middle temporal cortex and in the lingual gyrus, and decreased in the thalamus. At the last level (0.4 MAC vs. 1 MAC) the rCBF was increased in the insula and decreased in the posterior cingulate, the lingual gyrus, precuneus and in the frontal cortex.
At sevoflurane concentrations at 0.7% and 2.0% a significant decrease in relative rCBF was detected in the thalamus.

We designed this clinical study to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the patient state index (PSI) with the BIS during the perioperative period when the new electrode sensors were used. Twenty-two consenting patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic procedures were enrolled in this prospective study. The elapsed time to apply electrodes and obtain a baseline index value was recorded, as were the comparative PSI and BIS values at specific time intervals during the induction, maintenance, and emergence periods in patients who were administered a standardized general anesthetic. In addition, the changes in these indices were recorded after a bolus dose of propofol (20 mg IV) or a 2% increase or decrease in the inspired concentration of desflurane during the maintenance period. The total elapsed time to obtain an index value was similar with both devices (66 +/- 32 s versus 72 +/- 41 s for the PSA and BIS, respectively). By using logistic regression models, both the BIS and PSI were found to be equally effective as predictors of unconsciousness (i.e., failure to respond to verbal stimuli). The PSI also correlated with the BIS during both the induction of (R = 0.85) and the emergence from (R = 0.74) general anesthesia. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detection of consciousness also indicated a similar performance with the PSI (0.98 +/- 0.05) and the BIS (0.97 +/- 0.05). During the maintenance period, the PSI values tended to be lower than the BIS value; however, the responses to changes in propofol and desflurane were similar. Finally, the PSI (versus BIS) values showed less interference from the electrocautery unit during the operation (31% versus 73%, respectively). Although the list price of the PSArray(2) disposable electrode strip (USD $24.95) was higher than that of the BIS XP sensor (USD $17.50), the average sale price (USD $14.95) was identical for both electrode systems. Therefore, we conclude that the PSA monitor with the PSArray(2) is a cost-effective alternative to the BIS monitor with the XP sensor for evaluating consciousness during the induction of and emergence from general anesthesia, as well as for titrating propofol and desflurane during the maintenance period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15502043/

The authors compared the performance of the Narcotrend index (software version 4.0) to the Bispectral Index (BIS, version XP; Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA) as electroencephalographic measures of isoflurane drug effect during general anesthesia.
The authors observed 15 adult patients scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy with a combined epidural-isoflurane general anesthesia technique. At least 45 min after induction of general anesthesia, during a phase of constant surgical stimulation, end-tidal isoflurane concentrations were varied between 0.5 and 2.0 multiples of minimum alveolar concentration, and the BIS and the Narcotrend index were recorded. The prediction probability (PK) was calculated for the BIS and the Narcotrend index to predict isoflurane effect compartment concentration for each measure. The correlation analysis of the BIS and the Narcotrend index with the isoflurane effect compartment concentration was obtained by pharmacodynamic modeling based on two sigmoidal curves to account for the discontinuity in both indices with the onset of burst suppression.
The prediction probabilities were indistinguishable (BIS PK = 0.72 +/- 0.07 (mean +/- SD); range, 0.61-0.84; Narcotrend index PK = 0.72 +/- 0.10; range, 0.51-0.87), as were the correlations between the electroencephalographic measures and isoflurane effect compartment concentrations (BIS R = 0.82 +/- 0.12; Narcotrend index R = 0.85 +/- 0.09). The pharmacodynamic models for the BIS and the Narcotrend index yielded nearly identical results.
The BIS and the Narcotrend index detected the electroencephalographic effects of isoflurane equally. Combining two fractional sigmoid Emax models adequately described the data before and after the onset of burst suppression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15448516/

The study verified the 2 previously published BIS/N2O investigations showing no correlation between N2O dosage up to 70% and BIS. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation scores (OAA/S), however, correlated well with increasing doses of N2O from approximately 35 to 70%. A near linear dose-response relationship was established between OAA/S and end tidal (ET) sevoflurane concentrations of 0.4-0.7%. Only at the highest level of end tidal sevoflurane recorded, 0.7%, was statistically significant BIS depression seen. Subjects evaluated the acceptability of the sedative effect of the 2 gases, showing a slight preference for N2O. Comparable partial anterograde amnesia and sedation (OAA/S) were produced by both agents in administered concentrations of 40-70% N2O and 0.6-0.8% sevoflurane. Female subjects exhibited better memory and significantly less amnesia than males. No statistically significant changes occurred in any of the monitored vital signs. EMG readings demonstrated a statistically significant difference from control values only at the highest, 0.7%, ET concentration of sevoflurane.

Maintenance of a level of sedation sufficient to allow treatment while using the minimum dose possible and to induce faster waking is very important. The benefits of bispectral index monitoring have recently been reported for many applications, and it is expected to prove useful in intravenous sedation during dental treatment. However, because the sensor is attached to the forehead, which may be close to the site of operation, and because no neuromuscular blocking drugs are used, monitoring may be excessively interrupted by artifacts such as electromyographic input. Thus, we investigated the usefulness of bispectral index monitoring for patients under intravenous sedation during dental treatment. The incidence of ""good"" electroencephalograms, for which the electromyogram was less than 50 dB, signal quality index was more than 25%, and impedance was less than 10 kOhms, was 82.4% +/- 9.2%.

Automated BIS control with propofol or isoflurane administration via an infusion system has recently been described, a comparable study with isoflurane administration via a vaporizer had not been conducted yet. Our hypothesis was that our new model based closed-loop control system can safely be applied clinically and maintains the BIS within a defined target range better than manual control.
Twenty-three patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists risk class I-III, scheduled for decompressive spinal surgery were randomized into groups with either closed-loop or manual control of BIS using isoflurane. An alfentanil target-controlled infusion was adjusted according to standard clinical practice. The BIS target was set to 50 during the operation. The necessity of human intervention in the control system and events of inadequate sedation (BIS <40 or BIS >60) were counted. The number of phases of inadequate control, defined as BIS >/=65 for more than 3 min, were recorded. The performance of the controller was assessed by several indicators (mean absolute deviation and median absolute performance error) and measured during the skin incision phase, the subsequent low flow phase, and the wound closure phase. Recovery profiles of both groups were compared.
No human intervention was necessary in the closed-loop control group. The occurrence of inadequate BIS was quantified with the mean and median values of the area under the curve and amounted to 0.360 and 0.088 for the manual control group and 0.049 and 0.017 for the closed-loop control group, respectively. In the manual control group nine phases of inadequate control were recorded, compared with one in the closed-loop control group, 10.3% to 0.5% of all observed anesthesia time. During all phases the averages of the performance parameters (mean absolute deviation and median absolute performance error) were more than 30% smaller in closed-loop control than in manual control (P < 0.05 between groups).
Closed-loop control with BIS using isoflurane can safely be applied clinically and performs significantly better than manual control, even in phases with abrupt changes of stimulation that cannot be foreseen by the control system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15329583/

Three groups of 20 patients received an effect-site controlled propofol infusion (Ce(PROP)) starting at 1 microg ml(-1) and increased in steps of 0.5 microg ml(-1) at 4 min intervals. In addition, a remifentanil infusion was maintained at a group-dependent, fixed effect-site target concentration (Ce(REMI)) (0, 2 or 4 ng ml(-1)). The ability of BIS, SE or RE to predict LOR(verbal) and LOR(noxious) were compared with the changes in BIS, SE and RE using logistic regression, prediction probability (P(K)), and sensitivity/specificity.
In all groups, BIS, SE and RE decreased with increasing Ce(PROP). However, BIS decreased more smoothly than SE and RE at deeper levels of sedation.

During surgery, the sevoflurane end-tidal concentration was kept at 0.5%, 1%, or 2% for 5 min before each measurement. Blood pressure, heart rate, and the A-line ARX index (n = 50), and the bispectral index (n = 50) were measured.
Blood pressure and heart rate increased following laryngeal mask airway insertion and blood pressure decreased at 2% sevoflurane in both groups similarly. The A-line ARX index, but not the bispectral index, increased significantly by laryngeal mask airway insertion and skin incision. The A-line ARX index decreased at 2% sevoflurane compared with 0.5%, while the bispectral index remained unchanged.
During sevoflurane-nitrous oxide anesthesia, the A-line ARX index might be a more sensitive indicator of anesthetic depth than the bispectral index.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15315622/

Epinephrine stimulates the alpha-adrenoceptor, and it is known that the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists have a central inhibitory effect. We investigated the effect of intrathecal epinephrine during propofol sedation with spinal anesthesia, using a bispectral index (BIS) monitor.
Twenty adult patients, scheduled for spinal anesthesia, were allocated to the control group ( n = 10) or epinephrine group ( n = 10). Patients in the control group received 14 mg of tetracaine, whereas the epinephrine group received 14 mg of tetracaine and 0.2 mg of epinephrine. Immediately after the pinprick test, propofol was administered at 0.5 mg x kg(-1) by infusion for the initial dose, then continuously at 2 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) in both groups. BIS scores were recorded before subarachnoid block, and then every 5 min for 90 min after subarachnoid block.
There were significant differences in the BIS score between the two groups at 45-55 min and at 60-70 min after subarachnoid block.

15277912,Effects of Bispectral Index monitoring on ambulatory anesthesia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and a cost analysis.,Anesthesiology,2004,Liu SS,"Ambulatory surgery is growing in popularity worldwide. For example, 50-70% of surgical procedures in North America are performed on an ambulatory basis. Use of Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring for titration of general anesthesia may allow use of less anesthetics, reduction in side effects, and faster patient recovery.
MEDLINE and other databases were searched for randomized controlled trials examining the use of BIS monitoring versus standard practice in ambulatory surgery patients. Outcomes were extracted from these articles, and a meta-analysis was performed.
One thousand three hundred eighty subjects from 11 trials were included in the meta-analysis. The use of BIS monitoring significantly reduced anesthetic consumption by 19%, reduced the incidence of nausea/vomiting (32% vs. 38%; odds ratio, 0.77), and reduced time in the recovery room by 4 min. However, these benefits did not result in significant reduction in time until patient discharge from the ambulatory surgery unit. Cost analysis using pooled costs to reflect North America, Europe, and Asia indicated that use of BIS monitoring increased the cost per patient by 5.55 US dollars because of the cost of BIS electrodes.
The use of BIS monitoring modestly reduced anesthetic consumption, risk of nausea and vomiting, and recovery room time. These benefits did not reduce time spent in the ambulatory surgery unit, and cost of the BIS electrode exceeded any cost savings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15277912/

In this study we tested whether different brain regions were affected by propofol and thiopental at similar drug effects. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were identified by using SPM99 analysis of images obtained with positron emission tomography with (15)O water. Ten right-handed male volunteers (age, 35 +/- 10 yr; weight, 74.1 +/- 7.5 kg; mean +/- sd) were randomized to receive thiopental (n = 4) or propofol (n = 6) to target sedative and hypnotic concentrations with bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. Four positron emission tomography images were obtained during various tasks at baseline and with sedative and hypnotic effects. Two participants receiving propofol were unresponsive at sedative concentrations and were not included in the final analyses. Median serum concentrations were 1.2 and 2.7 microg/mL for sedative and hypnotic propofol effects, respectively. Similarly, thiopental concentrations were 4.8 and 10.6 microg/mL. BIS decreased similarly in both groups. The pattern of rCBF change was markedly different for propofol and thiopental. Propofol decreased rCBF in the anterior (right-sided during sedation) brain regions, whereas thiopental decreased rCBF primarily in the cerebellar and posterior brain regions. At similar levels of drug effect, propofol and thiopental affect different regions of the brain. These differences may help to identify the loci of action for the nonsedative effects of propofol, such as amnesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15271714/

Forty-five patients scheduled for elective surgery were allotted to one of three groups. They were given either alfentanil 3 microg kg(-1) min(-1) (n = 15); esmolol 1 mg kg(-1) min(-1) (n = 16) or clonidine 3 microg kg(-1) (n = 14) as a 10 min infusion. The infusions of alfentanil and esmolol, but not of clonidine, were maintained during endotracheal intubation. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam (2 mg) and thiopental as required to suppress the eyelash reflex. Atracurium (0.5 mg kg(-1)) was given to produce neuromuscular block. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and bispectral index were recorded on arrival (baseline), after study drug infusion, after injecting midazolam and thiopental, as well as after endotracheal intubation. ANOVA and chi2-test were used for analysis.
Blood pressure, heart rate and the bispectral index were unaltered by the study drugs, but thiopental requirements were reduced by alfentanil and clonidine (P < 0.014). Mean arterial pressure values (mean +/- standard error of mean) in the alfentanil, esmolol and clonidine groups were: baseline: 107.8 +/- 3.8; 106.6 +/- 3.9; 103.4 +/- 3.7 mmHg; after thiopental: 74.0 +/- 4.2; 85.6 +/- 4.3; 94.2 +/- 4.1 mmHg and after endotracheal intubation: 91.7 +/- 5.3; 114.1 +/- 6.9; 123.6 +/- 5.6 mmHg, respectively (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.001). Mean arterial pressure changed significantly after intubation from baseline (P < 0.001) after alfentanil (-15%) and clonidine (+20%) but not after esmolol (+7%), while the changes between pre- and postintubation values were similar in all groups (24-33% increase). The bispectral index indicated that all patients had an adequate level of hypnosis, but the variability was higher in the esmolol group (P < 0.002).

However, there is no objective physiologic parameter available to monitor a patient's conscious state. The Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor has been validated as an objective measure of depth of anaesthesia. We studied the BIS monitor for this role in procedural sedation.
A prospective, observational study with convenience sampling of adult patients in ED who underwent procedural sedation. Patients were treated according to standard practice and sedated as determined by the treating physician. Treating physicians were blinded to the BIS value. BIS values were recorded and compared to the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAAS). Upon recovery, patients were asked about recall of events while they were sedated.
Twelve patients were enrolled and 110 paired readings from 11 patients (7 male) were obtained. It was not possible to obtain readings from one patient. The mean age was 58 years (range 20-94). The Spearman correlation between BIS and OAAS was 0.027 (95% CI -0.582-0.617). For the three patients who received propofol, the correlation was 1.0. There were no episodes of explicit recall of events during the period of sedation.
BIS monitoring is feasible in the ED. Our small study suggests that there is a poor correlation between BIS values and the OAAS scale. Larger studies are required to further explore this relationship. Further developments in brain monitoring technology are also needed before this form of monitoring becomes clinically useful for procedural sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15239723/

The objective of this study was to establish a relation between the Bispectral Index (BIS) and other variables derived from the analysis of the electroencephalographic signal, with the probability of recovering consciousness in patients in a coma state due to severe cerebral damage.
Twenty-five critically ill, unconscious brain-injured patients from whom sedative drugs were withdrawn at least 24 h before BIS recording were prospectively studied. BIS, 95% spectral edge frequency, burst suppression ratio, and frontal electromyography were recorded for 20 min. The neurologic condition of the patients was measured according to the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). Patients were followed up for assessment of recovery of consciousness for 6 months after the injury. The studied variables were compared between the group of patients who recovered consciousness and those who did not recover. Their predictive ability was evaluated by means of the Pk statistic. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to model the relation between variables and probability of recovery of consciousness. Cross-validation was used to validate the proposed model.
There were statistically significant differences between the group of patients who recovered consciousness and those who did not with respect to BISmax, BISmin, BISmean, and BISrange, frontal electromyography, signal quality index values, and GCSBIS. The Pk (SE) values were 0.99 (0.01) for electromyelography, 0.96 (0.05) for BISmax, 0.92 (0.05) for BISmean, 0.92 (0.06) for BISrange, and 0.82 (0.09) for GCSBIS. The odds ratio for BISmax in the logistic regression model was 1.17 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.35).

Recent evidence suggests that spinal cord anaesthesia modifies reticulo-thalamo-cortical arousal by decreasing afferent sensory transmission. We hypothesized that epidural anaesthesia produces sensory deafferentation-dependent sedation that is associated with impairment of brainstem transmission. We used brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) to evaluate reticular function in 11 volunteers.
Epidural anaesthesia was induced with 2-chloroprocaine 2%. Haemodynamic and respiratory responses, sensory block level, sedation depth and BAEP were assessed throughout induction and resolution of epidural anaesthesia. Sedation was evaluated using verbal rating score (VRS), observer's assessment alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score, and bispectral index score (BIS). Prediction probability (PK) was used to associate sensory block with sedation, as well as BIS with other sedation measures. Spearman's rank order correlation was used to associate block level and sedation with the absolute and interpeak BAEP latencies.
Sensory block level significantly predicted VRS (PK=0.747), OAA/S score (PK=0.748) and BIS. BIS predicted VRS and OAA/S score (PK=0.728). The latency of wave III of BAEP significantly correlated with sedation level (rho=0.335, P<0.01) and sensory block (rho=0.394, P<0.01). The other BAEP parameters did not change during epidural anaesthesia. Haemodynamic and respiratory responses remained stable throughout the study.
Sedation during epidural anaesthesia depends on sensory block level and is associated with detectable block-dependent alterations in the brainstem auditory evoked responses. Sensory deafferentation may reduce CNS alertness through mechanisms related to brainstem neural activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15220178/

Eighty female patients undergoing partial mastectomy were randomly allocated to AAI or BIS (40 per group). Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg x kg(-1) and fentanyl 3 micro g x kg(-1) during the inhalation of oxygen. A laryngeal mask airway (LMA) #3 was inserted. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol 4 mg x kg(-1) x hr(-1), fentanyl 1 micro g x kg(-1) given at the start of surgery, and nitrous oxide 4 L x min(-1) in oxygen 2 L x min(-1). Blood pressure, heart rate, and AAI or BIS were monitored, including recovery time of the index after disturbance by electrocautery.
The AAI but not the BIS increased significantly with LMA insertion and skin incision, while blood pressure and heart rate did not change. The BIS decreased from 87 +/- 7 to 30-60 while the AAI decreased from 75 +/- 8 to 10-25 during anesthesia. The increase of the AAI was larger than that of the BIS at recovery from anesthesia. The variation of the index was smaller in the AAI than in the BIS. Recovery time of the index after electrocautery was significantly longer in the BIS group (21 +/- 9 sec) than that in the AAI group (5 +/- 3 sec).
During propofol-fentanyl-nitrous oxide anesthesia, the AAI responded to LMA insertion or surgical incision, but not the BIS, and the AAI had smaller variations. The AAI recovered faster from the disturbance by electrocautery than the BIS. Thus, the AAI may be a more sensitive and useful detector of arousal than the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15197114/

Aside from its unpleasantness, there is a correlation with intensive care unit (ICU) syndrome/delirium. Reasons for sleep deprivation appear to be multifactorial, including the underlying illness, an acute superimposed disturbance, medications, and the ICU environment itself. There are reasons to believe that alterations of the 'biological clock' might contribute. Melatonin secretion is one reflection of this internal sleep/wake mechanism. Melatonin levels are normally high during the night and low during daytime, being suppressed by bright light.
Melatonin levels in blood and urine were studied over 3 consecutive days in eight critically ill patients during deep sedation and mechanical ventilation. Sedation was assessed with the sedation-agitation (SAS) scale and bispectral index (BIS) monitor.
The circadian rhythm of melatonin release was abolished in all but one patient, who recovered much more quickly than the others. There was no correlation between melatonin levels and levels of sedation.
This study indicates that dyssynchronization of the melatonin secretion rhythm is common in critically ill and mechanically ventilated patients. It could be hypothesized that an impairment of the melatonin rhythm may play a role in the development of sleep disturbances and delirium in intensive care patients, and that melatonin supply could reduce the incidence of these phenomena.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15196098/

The Bispectral Index System (BIS) is an EEG monitor that measures the level of sedation. The authors compared discharge times of patients who had BIS monitoring to those who did not to determine if the use of BIS speeded discharge.
After IRB approval, 20 children were enrolled. BIS was monitored continuously from admission until discharge. Each child received ketamine, midazolam, and glycopyrrolate i.m. Once sedated, the patient was transferred to the operating room, monitored, and i.v. access was established. GA proceeded with sevoflurane, rocuronium, and fentanyl. Randomly, in half the patients, the anesthesiologist knew and maintained the BIS at GA level of sedation by adjusting sevoflurane. In the rest, the anesthesiologist did not know BIS. Time from turning of sevoflurane to discharge was noted and compared.
Patients where the BIS was known and used were discharged 60+/-13 minutes after the end of GA. Patients where BIS was unknown were discharged 90+/-11 minutes after the end of GA (P<.001).

Infants and children requiring mechanical ventilation underwent a continuous infusion of either midazolam (starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg/h) or dexmedetomidine (starting dose of either 0.25 or 0.5 microg/kg/h) with intermittent morphine, as needed. The efficacy of sedation was assessed using the Ramsay sedation scale, pediatric intensive care unit sedation score, and the tracheal suctioning score as well as bispectral monitoring.
There were 10 patients in each group. Sedation as assessed by the clinical sedation scores and the bispectral index was equivalent in the 3 groups. There were 36 morphine boluses administered to the midazolam group versus 29 and 20 morphine boluses administered respectively to the 0.25 and 0.5 microg/kg/h dexmedetomidine groups (P = 0.02 for midazolam versus 0.5 microg/kg/h dexmedetomidine). Total morphine use (mg/kg/24 h) was 0.74 +/- 0.5, 0.55 +/- 0.38, and 0.28 +/- 0.12 in the midazolam and the two dexmedetomidine groups respectively (P = not significant for midazolam versus 0.25 dexmedetomidine, P = 0.01 for midazolam versus 0.5 dexmedetomidine). In the two dexmedetomidine groups, 5 of 6 patients who at some point had a Ramsay score of 1 were less than 12 months of age while only 1 was more than 12 months of age (P < 0.05).
At a dose of 0.25 microg/kg/h, dexmedetomidine was approximately equivalent to midazolam at 0.22 mg/kg/h. At 0.5 microg/kg/h, dexmedetomidine provided more effective sedation as demonstrated by the need for fewer bolus doses of morphine, a decrease in the 24-hour requirements for supplemental morphine, as well as a decrease in the total number of assessment points with a Ramsay score of 1 (inadequate sedation) and the number of patients who had a Ramsay score of 1.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15180019/

Our purpose was to compare BIS values with objective assessments of the level of hypnosis in children. We postulated that BIS predicted the level of anesthesia during induction and emergence in children.
In a prospective observational study, we evaluated the BIS monitor in 87 children (ages: 0.3 to 14 yr) ASA physical status I-II undergoing general surgery under sevoflurane and nitrous oxide. Clinical signs of inhalational anesthesia (CSA), the motor response to surgical incision and signs of arousal were used as indicators of the depth of anesthesia. CSA and BIS measurements were paired every minute during induction and emergence until arousal.
CSA scores decreased during induction and increased during emergence (P < 0.001) and correlated with changes in sevoflurane concentrations (r = -0.46; P < 0.001). BIS was associated with changes in CSA scores during induction (r = 0.49; P < 0.01) and emergence (r = 0.62; P < 0.01), but the ranges of individual BIS values overlapped several levels of hypnosis. A BIS value greater than 50 had a positive predictive value of 25% for distinguishing between responders and non-responders to surgical incision. A BIS score equal or greater than 72 had a predictive value of 63% for discriminating between pre-arousal and arousal.
BIS correlates with several levels of hypnosis during inhalational induction and emergence in children, but individual BIS values show large inter-individual variability. The BIS monitor identified the physiological changes associated with arousal and distinguished the effects of preoperative sedation during emergence. The use of movement as an endpoint of hypnosis during surgical stimulation does not correlate with BIS values in children. The large inter-individual variability of BIS at different levels of anesthetic depth may limit the applicability of BIS to pediatric anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15128633/

However, a new emulsion of 1% propofol (Ampofol) containing 50% less lipid has recently become available for clinical investigation. This study was designed to compare the pharmacodynamic properties of Ampofol with those of a standard formulation (Diprivan) when administered for intraoperative sedation.
Sixty healthy outpatients undergoing minor operations with local anesthesia were randomly assigned to receive either Ampofol (n = 31) or Diprivan (n = 29) for intravenous sedation. The sedation was initiated with an intravenous loading dose of propofol, 0.75 mg/kg, followed by an initial infusion rate of 50 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) to achieve an Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score of 3. The targeted level of sedation was maintained with a variable-rate propofol infusion during the operation. The onset times to achieving a sedation score of 3, the severity of pain on injection of the loading dose, intraoperative hemodynamic variables, and electroencephalographic Bispectral Index values were recorded. In addition, recovery times, postoperative pain and nausea, and patient satisfaction with the sedative medication were assessed.
There were no significant differences between Ampofol and Diprivan with respect to onset times, dosage requirements, Bispectral Index values, hemodynamic variables, recovery times, or patient satisfaction scores. The incidence of moderate pain on injection was higher in the Ampofol group (26%vs. 7% with Diprivan; P < 0.05).

The auditory event-related potentials P1, mismatch negativity (MMN), and early right anterior negativity (ERAN) originate from different cortical areas and reflect different stages of auditory processing. The P1 originates mainly from the primary auditory cortex. The MMN is generated in or in the close vicinity of the primary auditory cortex but is also dependent on frontal sources. The ERAN mainly originates from frontal generators. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of increasing propofol sedation on different stages of auditory processing as reflected in P1, MMN, and ERAN.
The P1, the MMN, and the ERAN were recorded preoperatively in 18 patients during four levels of anesthesia adjusted with target-controlled infusion: awake state (target concentration of propofol 0.0 microg/ml), light sedation (0.5 microg/ml), deep sedation (1.5 microg/ml), and unconsciousness (2.5-3.0 microg/ml). Simultaneously, propofol anesthesia was assessed using the Bispectral Index.
Propofol sedation resulted in a progressive decrease in amplitudes and an increase of latencies with a similar pattern for MMN and ERAN. MMN and ERAN were elicited during sedation but were abolished during unconsciousness. In contrast, the amplitude of the P1 was unchanged by sedation but markedly decreased during unconsciousness.
The results indicate differential effects of propofol sedation on cognitive functions that involve mainly the auditory cortices and cognitive functions that involve the frontal cortices.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15108977/

Ninety females scheduled for mastectomy were divided into three groups. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl to insert a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and was maintained by adding nitrous oxide. EEG was monitored by either BIS, spectral edge frequency by pEEG, or A-AEP index by A-AEP. We recorded the number of patients with impedance low enough to extract good EEG signals at the first electrodes application (success rate), the number with an index outside of the range considered appropriate for general anesthesia (inappropriateness rate), changes of the index by LMA insertion or surgical incision (responsiveness), and time to return to good EEG signals after signal disturbance by electric cautery (recovery time). The success rate was larger in BIS > or = A-AEP > pEEG. The inappropriateness rate was smaller in A-AEP < or = BIS , or = pEEG. The A-AEP group showed the largest responsiveness. The recovery time was shorter in pEEG < A-AEP < BIS. In summary, the BIS had the largest success rate, the A-AEP had the least inappropriateness rate and the largest responsiveness, and the pEEG had the fastest recovery time.
We compared the usefulness of three electroencephalogram monitors. The Bispectral Index was the easiest for obtaining low impedance, the auditory evoked potential index had the least inappropriateness rate for general anesthesia and had the largest responsiveness, and the spectral edge frequency was the fastest in stabilizing measurement after electric cautery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15105212/

However, the exact algorithm used to synthesize the parameters to BIS values is not known. The relationship between BIS and EEG parameters was evaluated during nitrous oxide/isoflurane anesthesia. Twenty patients scheduled for elective ophthalmic surgery were enrolled in the study. After EEG recording with a BIS monitor (A-1050) was begun, general anesthesia was induced and maintained with 0.5%-2% isoflurane and 66% nitrous oxide. Using software we developed, we continuously recorded BIS, spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF95), and EEG parameters such as relative beta ratio (BetaRatio), relative synchrony of fast and slow wave (SynchFastSlow), and burst suppression ratio. BetaRatio was linearly correlated with BIS (r = 0.90; P < 0.01; n = 253) at BIS more than 60. At a BIS range of 30 to 80, SynchFastSlow (r = 0.60; P < 0.01; n = 3314) and SEF95 (r = 0.75; P < 0.01; n = 3339) were linearly correlated with BIS. The correlation between BIS and SEF95 was significantly better than the correlation between BIS and SynchFastSlow (P < 0.01). At BIS less than 30, the burst suppression ratio was inversely linearly correlated with BIS (r = 0.76; P < 0.01; n = 65). At BIS less than 80, burst-compensated SEF95 was linearly correlated with BIS (r = 0.78; P < 0.01; n = 3404). In the range of BIS from 60 to 100, BIS can be calculated from BetaRatio. At surgical levels of anesthesia, BIS and SynchFastSlow (a parameter derived from bispectral analysis) or burst-compensated SEF95 (derived from power spectral analysis) are well correlated. However, our results show that SynchFastSlow has no advantage over SEF95 in calculation of BIS.

15087615,Does the use of electroencephalographic bispectral index or auditory evoked potential index monitoring facilitate recovery after desflurane anesthesia in the ambulatory setting?,Anesthesiology,2004,"White PF, Ma H, Tang J, Wender RH, Sloninsky A, Kariger R","Analogous to the Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor, the auditory evoked potential monitor provides an electroencephalographic-derived index (AAI), which is alleged to correlate with the central nervous system depressant effects of anesthetic drugs. This clinical study was designed to test the hypothesis that intraoperative cerebral monitoring guided by either the BIS or the AAI value would facilitate recovery from general anesthesia compared with standard clinical monitoring practices alone in the ambulatory setting.
Sixty consenting outpatients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned to one of three study groups: (1) control (standard practice), (2) BIS guided, or (3) AAI guided. Anesthesia was induced with 1.5-2.5 mg/kg propofol and 1-1.5 microg/kg fentanyl given intravenously. Desflurane, 3%, in combination with 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen was administered for maintenance of general anesthesia. In the control group, the inspired desflurane concentration was varied based on standard clinical signs. In the BIS- and AAI-guided groups, the inspired desflurane concentrations were titrated to maintain BIS and AAI values in targeted ranges of 50-60 and 15-25, respectively. BIS and AAI values, hemodynamic variables, and the end-tidal desflurane concentration were recorded at 5-min intervals during the maintenance period. The emergence times and recovery times to achieve specific clinical endpoints were recorded at 1- to 10-min intervals. The White fast-track and modified Aldrete recovery scores were assessed on arrival in the PACU, and the quality of recovery score was evaluated at the time of discharge home.
A positive correlation was found between the AAI and BIS values during the maintenance period. The average BIS and AAI values (mean +/- SD) during the maintenance period were significantly lower in the control group (BIS, 41 +/- 10; AAI, 11 +/- 6) compared with the BIS-guided (BIS, 57 +/- 14; AAI, +/- 11) and AAI-guided (BIS, 55 +/- 12; AAI, 20 +/- 10) groups. The end-tidal desflurane concentration was significantly reduced in the BIS-guided (2.7 +/- 0.9%) and AAI-guided (2.6 +/- 0.9%) groups compared with the control group (3.6 +/- 1.5%). The awakening (eye-opening) and discharge times were significantly shorter in the BIS-guided (7 +/- 3 and 132 +/- 39 min, respectively) and AAI-guided (6 +/- 2 and 128 +/- 39 min, respectively) groups compared with the control group (9 +/- 4 and 195 +/- 57 min, respectively). More importantly, the median [range] quality of recovery scores was significantly higher in the BIS-guided (18 [17-18]) and AAI-guided (18 [17-18]) groups when compared with the control group (16 [10-18]).

An end-tidal concentration of 0.5 MAC isoflurane in 50% nitrous oxide (N(2)O) during cesarean delivery resulted in bispectral index (BIS) values >60, the threshold below which consciousness is unlikely. Our aim was to determine the BIS values achieved with the equivalent end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane and to determine if a larger concentration would consistently maintain BIS values <60. Twenty ASA physical status I-II parturients were randomized to receive an end-tidal concentration of either 1% sevoflurane or 1.5% sevoflurane delivered in 50% N(2)O throughout surgery. Thiopental 4 mg/kg was used for anesthetic induction. Morphine 0.1-0.15 mg/kg was administered only after delivery. Mean BIS values in the period between skin incision and neonatal delivery were 61 (95% confidence interval, 57-64) in the 1% sevoflurane group, versus 42 (95% confidence interval, 37-47) in the 1.5% sevoflurane group. BIS values were significantly different between groups at skin incision, uterine incision, delivery, and 10 min after delivery, but not thereafter. Indices of maternal and neonatal outcome were similar between groups.
Bispectral index (BIS) values <60 are consistent with a high probability of unconsciousness. An end-tidal concentration of 1.5% sevoflurane maintained BIS values <60 during cesarean delivery, whereas 1% did not. Adverse effects were not seen with the use of larger concentrations of sevoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15041614/
15039474,Dexmedetomidine overdose in the perioperative setting.,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,2004,"Jorden VS, Pousman RM, Sanford MM, Thorborg PA, Hutchens MP","To report 3 cases of accidental dexmedetomidine overdose in the perioperative setting and review the pathophysiology of alpha2-agonist overdose. case summaries: Three patients accidentally received overdoses of dexmedetomidine, one intraoperatively (192 microg over 20 min) and 2 postoperatively (4 and 2 rather than 0.4 and 0.2 microg/kg/h; 0.5 microg/kg/min rather than 0.5 microg/kg/h). Hemodynamic parameters remained stable for all 3 patients. The most notable sign was oversedation diagnosed either clinically or using a bispectral index monitor; Naranjo criteria suggest possible or probable association of the reactions with dexmedetomidine. In all 3 cases, oversedation resolved within one hour of drug discontinuation. There were no other sequelae, and the remainder of each patient's hospital course was unremarkable.
As of this writing, dexmedetomidine dosing in excess of the label recommendation has been reported, but accidental dexmedetomidine overdose in clinical practice has not been described. Excessive levels of sedation were the only significant finding in all 3 patients. Dexmedetomidine's short redistribution half-life of 6 minutes should lead to rapid resolution of oversedation induced by overdoses if the overall duration of infusion is short (< or =8 h). While the patients reported here were hemodynamically stable, dexmedetomidine may engender significant hemodynamic changes either because of sympatholysis at normal doses or vasoconstriction at higher than recommended doses. The absence of a significant hypertensive response to high dexmedetomidine concentrations suggests that dexmedetomidine-induced hypertension may be multifactorial, not simply related to plasma drug concentrations.
Practitioners presented with dexmedetomidine overdose should be prepared to manage oversedation. While hemodynamic alterations may be seen with dexmedetomidine use, hypertension from high dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations is not a consistent response. Practitioners using dexmedetomidine should carefully note that dosing for this agent is described by the manufacturer in microg/kg/h, not microg/kg/min.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15039474/

Measurements of BIS were later paired with sedation assessments. Despite being statistically significant (p=.002), the correlation between BIS and VAS in our 147 paired readings was fair (Pearson's rho=-0.37) and displayed wide variability. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of BIS demonstrated no discriminatory power in predicting sedation adequacy (area under curve 0.53).

The purpose of this study was to assess the depth of sedation administered to children in four locations using the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS).
Eighty-six children under the age of 12 years undergoing procedures with conscious or deep sedation were enrolled. The study included patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, computerized tomography imaging, gastrointestinal endoscopy, and dental procedures. Sedation for each procedure was based on departmental protocols and preferences; the study did not dictate choice or dose of drugs. An independent observer applied the UMSS sedation scale at 10 min intervals for 1 h. The observer and the personnel administering sedation were blinded to the BIS score, which was recorded continuously.
The goal of either conscious or deep sedation was attained in 53% (BIS) and 72% (UMSS) of patients. Depth consistent with general anaesthesia was observed in 35% (BIS) and 0% (UMSS), and an awake state was observed in 12% (BIS) and 28% (UMSS). About 8% of patients experienced desaturation and airway events associated with deeper levels of sedation.
Our data demonstrate wide variations in depth of sedation attained in the hospital. The goal of either conscious or deep sedation was not achieved in a significant number of children.

Anesthesia was induced with sufentanil 0.1 microg/kg (or fentanyl 1 microg/kg) and propofol 2 mg/kg IV and maintained with a variable-rate propofol infusion, 120-200 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). Onset times to loss of the eyelash reflex and dropping a syringe were recorded. Severity of pain on injection, speed of induction, intraoperative hemodynamic variables, and electroencephalographic bispectral index values were assessed. Recovery times to opening eyes and orientation were noted. The results demonstrated that there were no significant differences between Ampofol and Diprivan with respect to onset times, speed of induction, anesthetic dose requirements, bispectral index values, hemodynamic variables, recovery variables, or patient satisfaction. However, the incidence of pain on injection was more frequent in the Ampofol group (26% versus 6%, P < 0.05). We conclude that Ampofol is equipotent to Diprivan with respect to its anesthetic properties but was associated with a more frequent incidence of mild pain on injection.
The pharmacodynamic profile of a lower-lipid containing emulsion of propofol (Ampofol) was compared with Diprivan when administered for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia.

Fifty-seven patients scheduled for elective abdominal, orthopaedic (Groups 1 and 2) or cardiac surgery (Group 3) under general anaesthesia were enrolled in the study. Anaesthesia was performed using remifentanil/ sevoflurane (Group 1, 19 patients), remifentanil/propofol (Group 2, 19 patients) or sufentanil/propofol/isoflurane (Group 3, 19 patients).

A secondary data analysis was used to test the hypothesis that BIS monitoring provides a more objective form of sedation assessment that will lead to a decrease in overall rates of propofol administration and fewer incidences of oversedation. Data were abstracted from a quality improvement study of propofol use adjusted to BIS values in patients whose sedation levels were previously adjusted to a goal Ramsay score.

It has been validated in the operating room as an objective measure of sedation depth with nondissociative general anesthesia; however, its usefulness in the pediatric emergency department (ED) for procedural sedation and analgesia has not been established. We determine the ability of the bispectral index to monitor depth of nondissociative procedural sedation and analgesia in children.
This was an observational study conducted in a children's hospital ED. Procedural sedation and analgesia was performed in the standard manner, with the addition of bispectral index monitoring and simultaneous clinical sedation scoring (modified Ramsay Sedation Scale [range 1 to 8; 1=alert, 8=unresponsive]). Paired bispectral index and Ramsay Sedation Scale scores were assigned every 5 minutes during the sedation. Ramsay Sedation Scale scores were assigned by a single study investigator blinded to the bispectral index score. An emergency physician independently administered all medications for procedural sedation and analgesia. The correlation between the paired bispectral index/Ramsay Sedation Scale scores was determined by using a repeated-measures regression analysis. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the ability of the bispectral index to discriminate various thresholds of sedation depth.
A convenience sample of 20 patients was enrolled, providing 217 paired bispectral index/Ramsay Sedation Scale measurements. Median age was 4.6 years (range 0.4 to 16.7 years). Fourteen patients received midazolam with fentanyl; the remainder received pentobarbital. Bispectral index scores ranged from 40 to 98 (mean 81.6+/-16.1). Ramsay Sedation Scale scores ranged from 1 to 8 (median 3; interquartile range 2 to 4). The simple Pearson correlation between paired bispectral index and Ramsay Sedation Scale scores was -0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.83 to -0.72; P<.001). After adjustment for the nonindependence of intrapatient data with bivariate repeated-measures analysis, the correlation was -0.67 (95% CI -0.90 to -0.43; P<.001). The linear regression coefficient between bispectral index and Ramsay Sedation Scale scores was estimated to be between -5.7 and -12.7. ROC curve analysis demonstrated moderate to high discriminatory power of bispectral index scores in predicting level of sedation throughout the sedation continuum, with areas under the curve at least 0.87 for all Ramsay Sedation Scale score thresholds. Bispectral index scores between 60 and 90 predicted with moderate accuracy traditional clinical levels of sedation typically encountered during procedural sedation and analgesia in the pediatric ED.

Bispectral index monitoring was used to adjust depth of hypnosis, and hemodynamic variables were used to determine analgesia administration. Consented patients underwent either laparoscopic bariatric or one-level lumbar disk surgery. After endotracheal intubation and application of headphones, baseline heart rate and arterial blood pressure were established. Isoflurane was titrated to maintain sedation on the basis of a target bispectral index range of 40-60, and 25-microg increments of fentanyl were administered in response to increases in heart rate and systolic arterial blood pressure. Bariatric patients who listened to Hemi-Sync required one-third less fentanyl than the control group (mean [SD]: 0.015 [0.01] vs 0.024 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) [0.01]) (P = 0.009). It is interesting to note that lumbar patients in the experimental and control groups required similar amounts of fentanyl (0.012 [0.01] vs 0.015 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) [0.01]). End-tidal isoflurane concentration was similar for Hemi-Sync and blank-tape patients (bariatric, 0.74% (0.14) vs 0.77% (0.21); lumbar, 0.36% [0.16] vs 0.39% [0.12]). The bariatric patients in this study demonstrated that Hemi-Sync may be an innovative intraoperative supplement to analgesia.

Listening to music and therapeutic suggestions were also studied, but mostly in awake patients, and these have a positive effect on postoperative recovery and the need for analgesia. In this study, we evaluated the effect of listening to music under general anesthesia on the neurohormonal response to surgical stress as measured by epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) blood levels. Thirty female patients scheduled for abdominal gynecological procedures were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups: group NM (no music) and group M (music). In group M, music was played from after the induction of anesthesia until the end of surgery. In the NM group, the patients wore the headphones but no music was played. We established three sample times for hormonal dosage during the procedure and one in the recovery room. Hemodynamic data were recorded at all times, and postoperative consumption of morphine in the first 24 h was noted. There was no group difference at any sample time or in the postoperative period in terms of mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, isoflurane end-tidal concentration, time of the day at which the surgery was performed, bispectral index (BIS) value, doses of fentanyl, or consumption of postoperative morphine. There was no difference between the two groups with regard to plasmatic levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, cortisol, or ACTH at any sample time, although the blood level of these hormones significantly increased in each group with surgical stimulation. In conclusion, we could not demonstrate a significant effect of intraoperative music on surgical stress when used under general anesthesia.

The MMWT value was recorded at each observation following the procedure. Subsequently, blinded observers recorded average BIS values for the 5 min before each UMSS observation.
There were moderate correlations between the BIS, MMWT, and UMSS scores (r = 0.68-0.78; P < 0.01). Revised criteria correctly identified children who were awake and alert (BIS value >/= 90) in 88% of the cases. Only 55% of the children had returned to baseline BIS values when discharged by the nurse, compared with 92% when revised criteria were met (P < 0.05). It took longer to meet revised criteria compared with standard criteria (75.3 +/- 76.2 min vs. 16.4 +/- 13.1 min; P = 0.001).
The incorporation of specific, objective discharge criteria (i.e., UMSS score of 0 or 1, MMWT duration >/= 20 min) may ensure a status closer to baseline (BIS value >/= 90) compared with nursing judgment using standard criteria. However, such assurance may delay the discharge of sedated children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14739792/

of this study is to verify, in caesarean delivery if the bupivacaine subarachnoid anaesthesia, with or without intrathecal fentanyl dose, produces a sedative effect, to define the entity and to identify the mechanism that most likely causes it.
The clinical investigation is divided into Part I (non-randomized trial) and Part II (randomized trial) and is set in the University hospital's delivery-unit. Part I: 45 pregnant women were recruited and enrolled in 3 groups: women having natural delivery (n=15), women receiving caesarean delivery with subarachnoid anaesthesia (n=15) and with general anaesthesia (n=15). Self-rating depression scale (SDS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), state anxiety inventory (SAI) and trait anxiety inventory (TAI) psychometric tests were patient-completed for pre-delivery anxiety evaluation. Part II: 23 pregnant women undergoing caesarean delivery were single-blind randomized to receive subarachnoid anaesthesia with single 12.75 mg 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (n=10) or with 12.75 microg 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 15 mg fentanyl (n=13). Bispectral index (BIS), observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale, self-sedation visual analogic scale (VAS) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were perioperatively monitored.
Part I: it was found, using SAI, a higher level of state anxiety in the pregnant women undergoing caesarean delivery than those having natural delivery (p<0.05). Part II: pregnant women receiving subarachnoid anaesthesia for caesarean delivery had a decrease of the level of alertness from 10 to 70 min after the execution of lumbar puncture (p<0.05), with a sedative peak from 35 to 45 min (p<0.01), as measured by OAA/S scale and self-sedation VAS but not by BIS. Women who received bupivacaine-fentanyl spinal anaesthesia had a more consistent sedative effect from 35 to 70 min (p<0.05).
Pregnant women undergoing caesarean delivery had a more elevated level of state anxiety, assessed by SAI, as seen in Part I. Subarachnoid anaesthesia in caesarean delivery is associated with a reduction of alertness level. A double mechanism might cause a clinically valuable sedative effect, observed by OAA/S scale and self-sedation VAS: decrease of the afferent spinal inputs and an anxiolytic psychophysiologic effect, induced by good outcome of the birth and mother-baby contact. Intrathecal bupivacaine-fentanyl dose produces a larger alertness decrease than single bupivacaine, because the anaesthetic block density increases. BIS was not a sensitive measure to detect the light sedation occurring in Part II of this study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14735021/

Twenty red and 19 non-red hair subjects were studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over design. Subjects were studied during placebo and midazolam at 30 ng.mL(-1) target effect site concentration. Sedation was assessed using the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale, the drowsiness visual analogue scale (VAS), and the bispectral index; cognition was assessed using the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status; and mood was assessed using the bipolar form of the Profile of Mood States (POMS).
Red hair volunteers showed significantly higher OAA/S (P < 0.01) and lower drowsiness VAS (P < 0.05) scores compared to non-red hair subjects during midazolam infusion. Visuospatial score was significantly higher in subjects with red compared to non-red hair during placebo and midazolam trials.

Sixty patients were enrolled in this study. Propofol, 2 mg/kg, was given to Group I for induction. Propofol was administered for induction until loss of response to verbal commands and until BIS values were around 50 to Groups II and III. After induction, the smallest BIS value was different in Group I. Decreases in total propofol dose were 36% and 43% in Groups II and III respectively as compared with Group I. The dose of propofol assessed by BIS analysis results in an important reduction of propofol requirement without side effects.
Hypotension during induction of anesthesia with propofol is common.

The Alaris AEP monitor includes the ""Click Detection"" (CD) (generating the message ""NO AEP"" or ""LOW AEP"") to detect the loss of auditory stimuli. We investigated the accuracy of the CD in 17 patients awake (AWAKE) and during anesthesia (ANESTHESIA) with accurately placed headphones (HP) and after disconnected HP (No HP) over 5 min each, respectively. Alaris AEP ARX index, CD, and Bispectral Index were recorded each minute. Changes were evaluated with the Friedman and Wilcoxon test. Sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) and receiver operating characteristic curve were analyzed for the accuracy of the CD. During AWAKE after disconnection of the HP, Alaris AEP ARX index decreased significantly (P < 0.05). The CD was able to detect No HP after 2 min with a SEN of 88% and a SPE of 97%. During ANESTHESIA, no changes were found after HP disconnection. CD detected No HP with a SEN of 100% and a SPE of 20%. The CD of the Alaris AEP monitor is not able to detect unnoticed disconnection of HP during ANESTHESIA.
Signal transmission of auditory evoked potentials can be suppressed by anesthetics, but also by disconnection of headphones.

Forty adult patients undergoing elective surgery were studied. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with an end-tidal isoflurane concentration (F(ET)ISO) of 1.0% for 20 min, then a 10-mL dose of either vecuronium 0.05 mg*kg(-1), 0.1 mg*kg(-1), 0.2 mg*kg(-1) or saline was administered in a randomized, double-blind design.

However, there is controversy regarding the impact of the alleged anesthetic-sparing effects of cerebral monitoring on the recovery process and patient outcome. We designed this prospective double-blinded, sham-controlled study to evaluate the impact of intraoperative monitoring with the electroencephalogram bispectral index (BIS) or auditory evoked potential (AEP) device on the usage of desflurane and the time to discharge from the recovery room, as well as on patient satisfaction with their anesthetic experience and recovery. Ninety healthy patients undergoing laparoscopic general surgery procedures using a standardized anesthetic technique were randomly assigned to one of three monitoring groups: standard clinical practice (control), BIS-guided, or AEP-guided. Both the BIS and AEP monitors were connected to all patients before induction of general anesthesia. In the control group, the anesthesiologists were not permitted to observe the BIS or AEP index values during the intraoperative period. In the BIS-guided group, the volatile anesthetic was titrated to maintain a BIS value in the range of 45-55. In the AEP-guided group, the targeted AEP index range was 15-20. The BIS and AEP indices, as well as end-tidal desflurane concentration, were recorded at 3-5 min intervals. Recovery times to awakening, tracheal extubation, fast-track score >or=12, and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge criteria were recorded at 1-10 min intervals. In addition, patient satisfaction with anesthesia and quality of recovery were evaluated on 100- and 18-point scales, respectively, at 24 h after surgery. The AEP- and BIS-guided groups were administered significantly smaller average end-tidal desflurane concentrations than the control group (3.8 +/- 0.9 and 3.9 +/- 0.6 versus 4.7 +/- 1.7, respectively) (P < 0.01). Although the emergence times to eye opening, tracheal extubation, and obeying commands were consistently shorter in the AEP and BIS groups (6 +/- 4 and 6 +/- 5 versus 8 +/- 8 min; 6 +/- 5 and 6 +/- 4 versus 11 +/- 10 min; and 8 +/- 4 and 7 +/- 4 versus 12 +/- 9 min, respectively), only the extubation times were significantly different from the control group (P < 0.05). More importantly, the length of the PACU stay was significantly shorter in both the AEP- and BIS-guided groups (79 +/- 43 and 80 +/- 47 versus 108 +/- 58 min, respectively) (P < 0.05). The patients' quality of recovery was also significantly higher in the two monitored groups (15 +/- 2 versus 13 +/- 3 in the control group, P < 0.05). We concluded that cerebral monitoring with either the BIS or AEP devices reduced the maintenance anesthetic (desflurane) requirement, resulting in a shorter length of stay in the PACU and improved quality of recovery after laparoscopic surgery. However, there were no significant outcome differences between the two cerebral monitored groups.
Compared with standard monitoring practices, use of an auditory evoked potential or bispectral index monitor to titrate the volatile anesthetic led to a significant reduction in the anesthetic requirement. The anesthetic-sparing effect of cerebral monitoring resulted in a shorter postanesthesia care unit stay and improved quality of recovery from the patient's perspective.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14633540/

We designed this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to test the hypothesis that the technique used for maintaining hemodynamic stability during general anesthesia can influence recovery after ambulatory surgery. Forty-five healthy consenting women undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy procedures were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: Group 1 (control, n = 15) received normal saline 5 mL and 1 mL, followed by a saline infusion at a rate of 0.005 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1); Group 2 (n = 15) received esmolol 50 mg and saline 1 mL, followed by an esmolol infusion 5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1); and Group 3 (n = 15) received esmolol 50 mg and nicardipine 1 mg, followed by an esmolol infusion 5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). The study drugs were administered after the induction of anesthesia with fentanyl 1.5 microg/kg, and propofol 2 mg/kg I.V. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium 0.12 mg/kg I.V. Anesthesia was initially maintained with desflurane 2% end-tidal and N(2)O 67% in oxygen in all 3 groups. During surgery, the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained within +/-15% of the baseline value by varying the study drug infusion rate and the inspired concentration of desflurane. In addition to MAP and heart rate values, electroencephalogram bispectral index values were recorded throughout the perioperative period. Recovery times and postoperative side effects were assessed. Compared with the control group, adjunctive use of esmolol and nicardipine attenuated the increase in heart rate (in Group 2) and MAP (in Group 3) after tracheal intubation. Furthermore, the use of an esmolol infusion as an adjunct to desflurane to control the acute autonomic responses during the maintenance period significantly decreased emergence times (4 +/- 2 versus 7 +/- 4 min), decreased the need for postoperative opioid analgesics (43% versus 80%), and reduced the time to discharge (209 +/- 89 versus 269 +/- 100 min). We conclude that the adjunctive use of esmolol alone or in combination with nicardipine during the induction of anesthesia reduced the hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation. Furthermore, use of an esmolol infusion as an adjuvant to desflurane-N(2)O anesthesia for controlling the acute hemodynamic responses during the maintenance period improved the recovery profile after outpatient laparoscopic surgery.
The adjunctive use of the beta-adrenergic blocker esmolol to control the acute sympathetic responses during desflurane-based anesthesia provided a more rapid awakening from anesthesia, reduced the postoperative opioid analgesic requirement, and decreased the time to discharge home after ambulatory laparoscopic surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14633533/

Prospective, observational cohort study.
A 42-bed multidisciplinary ICU in a tertiary care medical center.
Twelve consecutive patients with elevated intracranial pressure treated with pentobarbital infusions.
All patients were monitored continuously with the Aspect Medical Systems A-1050 bedside EEG monitor using a bilateral referential montage. Pentobarbital doses were titrated based on the raw EEG to attain a burst-suppression pattern with a goal of 3-5 bursts/minute. Drug dosage, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure values, EEG bursts/minute, BIS version 3.2, and SR were recorded daily.
The 12 patients were monitored for 62 patient-days. Mean +/- SD age was 32 +/- 15 years, seven (58%) patients were male, mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Heath Evaluation II score was 17.0 +/- 5.0, and hospital mortality was 42%. The mean pentobarbital infusion rate was 124 +/- 49 mg/hour or 2.3 +/- 1.3 mg/kg/hour, and mean pentobarbital serum concentration was 29.7 +/- 13 microg/ml. The mean BIS value was 18 +/- 14, mean SR 56% +/- 36%; BIS correlated well with SR (r=-0.99, p<0.001). For patient-days with a burst-suppression pattern, BIS 3.2 (r=0.90, p<0.001) and SR (r=-0.89, p<0.001) strongly correlated with the number of bursts/minute.

Forty-five patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups (0, 2, and 4 ng/ml remifentanil) to receive graded CePROP and predicted effect compartment controlled remifentanil (CeREMI). At every step, the ability to respond to verbal command using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAA/S), eyelash reflex, and electrical tetanic noxious stimulus were compared against BIS, AAI, and CePROP. Prediction probability and sensitivity/specificity were calculated.
Increasing CeREMI increased BIS and AAI values at LORverbal and LORlash and decreased CePROP. Similar findings were found for LORnoxious. The overall prediction probability to measure the hypnotic component of anesthesia remained accurate in the three groups for BIS, AAI, and CePROP. Combined information from CePROP, CeREMI, and BIS or AAI increased the overall prediction probability for predicting the OAA/S scale and LORlash. Less accuracy to LORnoxious was found in all independent variables.
Although BIS, AAI, and CePROP were influenced by remifentanil during propofol administration, their ability to detect OAA/S and LORlash remained accurate. Improved performance is obtained when BIS and AAI are measured in conjunction with drug targeted effect-site concentrations.

Hourly consumption of sufentanil was monitored. Cardiovascular, respiratory and biochemical data were recorded.
There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to cardiovascular, respiratory and biochemical parameters. Magnesium infusion, when added to sufentanil infusion, decreased the consumption of sufentanil at all times accept during the first hour (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in BIS values between the groups (P > 0.05).
This is the first clinical study to demonstrate that magnesium sulphate infusion decreases sufentanil requirements. Because of the limited number of patients included and the short period of observation, our findings must be confirmed by larger clinical trials of magnesium infusion titrated to achieve prespecified levels of sedation. Furthermore, randomized clinical studies are needed to determine the effects of magnesium infusion on opioids.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12974980/

The authors quantified the effects of sevoflurane and propofol as sole anesthetics and in combination with N2O on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2), and blood volume (rCBV) in the living human brain using positron emission tomography.
15O-labeled water, oxygen, and carbon monoxide were used as positron emission tomography tracers to determine rCBF, rCMRO2 and rCBV, respectively, in eight healthy male subjects during the awake state (baseline) and at four different anesthetic regimens: (1) sevoflurane alone, (2) sevoflurane plus 70% N2O (S+N), (3) propofol alone, and (4) propofol plus 70% N2O (P+N). Sevoflurane and propofol were titrated to keep a constant hypnotic depth (Bispectral Index 40) throughout anesthesia. End-tidal carbon dioxide was strictly kept at preinduction level.
The mean +/- SD end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was 1.5 +/- 0.3% during sevoflurane alone and 1.2 +/- 0.3% during S+N (P < 0.001). The measured propofol concentration was 3.7 +/- 0.7 microg/ml during propofol alone and 3.5 +/- 0.7 microg/ml during P+N (not significant). Sevoflurane alone decreased rCBF in some (to 73-80% of baseline, P < 0.01), and propofol in all brain structures (to 53-70%, P < 0.001). Only propofol reduced also rCBV (in the cortex and cerebellum to 83-86% of baseline, P < 0.05). Both sevoflurane and propofol similarly reduced rCMRO2 in all brain areas to 56-70% and 50-68% of baseline, respectively (P < 0.05). The adjunct N2O counteracted some of the rCMRO2 and rCBF reductions caused by drugs alone, and especially during S+N, a widespread reduction (P < 0.05 for all cortex and cerebellum vs. awake) in the oxygen extraction fraction was seen. Adding of N2O did not alter the rCBV effects of sevoflurane and propofol alone.
Propofol reduced rCBF and rCMRO2 comparably. Sevoflurane reduced rCBF less than propofol but rCMRO2 to an extent similar to propofol. These reductions in flow and metabolism were partly attenuated by adjunct N2O. S+N especially reduced the oxygen extraction fraction, suggesting disturbed flow-activity coupling in humans at a moderate depth of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12960544/
12960540,Awareness: Monitoring versus remembering what happened.,Anesthesiology,2003,"Kerssens C, Klein J, Bonke B","Awareness during anesthesia is foremost assessed with postoperative interviews, which may underestimate its incidence. On-line monitors such as the Bispectral Index and patient response to verbal command are not necessarily commonly used. This study investigated response to command during deep sedation (Bispectral Index 60-70) and the ability of prevailing monitoring techniques to indicate awareness and predict recall.
The authors systematically assessed the response to command using the isolated forearm technique while monitoring electroencephalographic and hemodynamic variables. Fifty-six elective surgical patients were repeatedly given verbal instructions to squeeze the observer's hand during target-controlled infusion with propofol and alfentanil. After recovery, conscious recall was assessed with a short structured interview.
Overall, 1,082 commands were given. No response was observed to 887 (82%) commands, an equivocal response was observed to 56 (5%) commands, and an unequivocal response was observed to 139 (13%) commands. Of the 37 patients (66%) with an unequivocal response to command (""awareness""), nine (25%) reported conscious recall after recovery. Their reports provided valuable insights as to how awareness may be adequately addressed. Hemodynamic variables poorly predicted awareness, whereas parameters derived from the encephalogram, especially the Bispectral Index, were highly significant predictors (P < 0.0001). Electroencephalographic parameters did not discriminate between patients with or without conscious recall, whereas heart rate and responsiveness to command did.
The incidence of awareness is underestimated when conscious recall is taken as evidence. Awareness can be monitored on-line with behavioral and modern neurophysiologic measures. Providing feedback during intra-anesthetic awareness helps patients to cope with a potentially stressful situation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12960540/

We designed this dose-finding study to determine the feasibility and safety of patient-controlled sedation (PCS) using propofol during these procedures. Twenty patients were familiarized with the PCS and asked to use PCS whenever they felt uncomfortable or anxious. Analgesia was provided by a single bolus of morphine IV 15 min before the procedure according to their daily intake. The first 10 patients used a fixed bolus of propofol 0.3 mg/kg and a lockout of 5 min. The degree of sedation was measured using bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. Demands versus delivery of propofol boluses were recorded. Within 1 h after the procedure, pain intensity was evaluated and satisfaction scores obtained from patients and nurses performing the dressing changes. In the first 10 patients, there were no respiratory rates <10 breaths/min, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were within 25% of baseline values, and peripheral saturation stayed more than 94% with additional small flow oxygen via nasal insufflation. There were double the demands than actual deliveries of propofol boluses. The BIS did not show significant decreases of <80 in any patient reflecting an insufficient state of sedation. Because the interim analysis of the efficacy of the PCS setup showed an insufficient state of sedation, a different PCS setup was evaluated in a second group of 10 patients (an individualized propofol bolus, titrated to achieve a significant decrease of BIS or a sleepy state, and no lockout period). The second group of patients showed a more effective sedation, with respiratory and hemodynamic variables being not significantly different from the first group of patients. PCS with propofol is feasible in burn patients and can be used safely. To provide an optimal sedation, we suggest to initially titrate the bolus to achieve a significant decrease of BIS or a clinically effective state of sedation and to abolish the lockout interval.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12933412/

Both groups received the intervention in the preoperative area and during the surgical procedure. Subjects underwent a propofol-based anesthetic regimen, and propofol doses required for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia were recorded.

This study compares bispectral index-guided anaesthesia with remifentanil and either propofol or isoflurane.
Eighty consenting patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Following induction with propofol and remifentanil, anaesthesia was maintained with remifentanil/propofol or remifentanil/isoflurane. Remifentanil infusion rates were guided by haemodynamic responses--maintaining mean arterial pressure and heart rate within 20% of baseline. Propofol and isoflurane administration was guided using the bispectral index (45-60). Thirty minutes before the end of surgery, morphine was administered (0.15 mg kg(-1) intravenously). Fifteen minutes before end of surgery, propofol and isoflurane were reduced (bispectral index 60-75). At the end of surgery, the anaesthetic agents were discontinued. Groups were compared for recovery, remifentanil doses and signs of inadequate anaesthesia using the chi2-test and ANOVA (P < 0.05).
The duration of surgery was longer in the propofol/remifentanil group (121 +/- 53 versus 94 +/- 40 min). Recovery data were not different between groups. The remifentanil infusion rate was significantly lower with additional isoflurane (0.18 +/- 0.06 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) than with additional propofol (0.31 +/- 0.20 microg kg(-1) min(-1)). The propofol infusion rate was 123 +/- 48 microg kg(-1) min(-1); isoflurane concentration was 0.66 +/- 0.13%.
Bispectral index-guided anaesthesia with remifentanil plus propofol or isoflurane results in the absence of postoperative recall and a fast recovery with both drug combinations.

Therefore, we used prediction probability (PK) to evaluate the performance of the bispectral index (BIS) of the EEG and automated responsiveness test (ART) to predict sedation depth and loss of subject's responsiveness during propofol sedation, with and without N2O.
Twenty volunteers were studied during propofol administration with (N2O) and without (Air) N2O. The protocol consisted of sequential 15-min cycles. After a control period, propofol was infused to a target effect-site concentration of 0.25 microg/ml (N2O) or 1.5 microg/ml (Air), which was subsequently increased by 0.25 or 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, until loss of responsiveness was detected by loss of response to command [observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score <or= 2].
Deeply sedated patients did not respond to ART indicating that the sensitivity was 1.0 with or without N2O. The specificity of ART was 0.24 with Air and 0.98 with N2O. The BIS was better than ART in predicting OAA/S score (PK = 0.84 vs. 0.77) and loss of responsiveness (PK = 0.87 vs. 0.69) during the Air trial. Nitrous oxide decreased the performance of BIS in predicting OAA/S score (PK = 0.76), but increased the performance of ART to predict loss of responsiveness (PK = 0.85).

After a 15-minute control period, propofol was infused to an initial target effect-site concentration of 0.25 microg x ml-1 (N2O) or 1.5 microg x ml-1 (Air). Subsequently, the target effect-site concentration was increased by 0.25 (N2O) or 0.5 microg x ml-1 (Air) for 15 min This sequence was continued until the volunteers lost consciousness as defined by an Observer's Assessment Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score = 2.
Venous plasma propofol concentrations at the beginning(9 elapsed minutes) and end(15 elapsed minutes) of the pseudo-steady state period differed by only 0.00 +/- 0.16 microg x ml-1 (P = 0.78) during the N2O and 0.00 +/- 0.25 microg x ml-1 (P = 0.91) during the Air trial. OAA/S scores and bispectral index values, as surrogate measures of pharmacodynamic effect, were not different during this time in either trial. The median(25th, 75th percentiles) of the median performance error (%) was -13 (-24, -1) during the N2O and -18 (-26, -9) during the Air trial.

Our aims were: to evaluate variations of BIS in the presence of high EMG activity associated with muscular rigidity after administration of high-dose fentanyl; to compare muscular rigidity, as measured by the EMG variable of the BIS monitor, in patients who were administered two different dosages of fentanyl at induction of cardiac anaesthesia.
26 patients undergoing CABG surgery, after premedication with morphine 0.15 mg/kg, were randomized to receive either fentanyl 50 mcg/kg (group F) or fentanyl 10 mcg/kg plus etomidate 0.2 mg/kg (group EF). The induction dose was administered over 2 minutes. Patients were manually ventilated with O2 via face mask. Five minutes after induction was complete, patients were clinically assessed using the Responsiveness portion of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale (OAAS). Haemodynamic data were recorded and arterial blood samples obtained at the time of OAAS observation. Patients were administered a neuromuscular blocking agent only after the OAAS assessment. BIS (3.4) was recorded from an A-2000 EEG monitor (Aspect Medical Systems) using disposable sensors (BIS Sensor, Aspect Medical Systems) applied per manufacturer's instructions. Data were recorded on a PC for off-line analysis.
At the time of OAAS observation, mean (95% CI) BIS in group F was 85 (77-92) compared to 67 (56-79) in group EF (p = 0.01). Similarly, mean (95% CI) EMG was 50 dB (45-56) in F and 41 dB (35-47) in EF (p = 0.01). Correlation between BIS and EMG was very high (r2 = 0.88). OAAS scores were significantly higher in group F (p = 0.03). Non significant correlation was observed between BIS and OAAS scores (r2 = 0.32, p = 0.1). Backward stepwise multiple regression analysis including EMG, pH, CO2, O2 and OASS scores showed EMG as strong predictor of BIS (p < 0.0001, r2 = 0.7). Regression of EMG against BIS yielded the equation: BIS = 3.7 + (1.6 x EMG).
During fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity BIS recordings reflect EMG variations. When assessing BIS in the absence of neuromuscular blockade, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of EMG on BIS before making conclusions about depth of sedation. Fentanyl-induced rigidity appears to be a dose-related phenomenon which the EMG variable of BIS 3.4 is able to quantify.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12885182/

In this study conducted in patients scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting, propofol and sufentanil, both administered by computer-controlled infusion, were titrated on the Bispectral Index (BIS) values using a predefined algorithm.
After written informed consent, 110 patients, 95 men and 15 women aged 61 (9) yr [mean (SD)], were randomly allocated to receive predicted sufentanil effect site concentrations (Ce) of 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, and 1.5 ng/ml, decreased by a third after sternotomy (groups 1-5). Target induction propofol concentration was 1.5 microg/ml and subsequently adjusted on BIS values. The following parameters were recorded: BIS values, predicted propofol Ce, the number of changes of propofol target, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, the number of bolus injection and doses of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator drugs, time to tracheal extubation, postoperative awareness and satisfaction scores, and cumulative morphine doses for the first postoperative day.
One patient randomized to group 1 required 0.75 ng/ml sufentanil Ce instead of 0.5 ng/ml for increased BIS values on tracheal intubation. BIS values were similar in the five groups. The predicted propofol Ce values were different (P < 0.05; analysis of variance) among the five groups: 1.59 (0.47) to 1.23 (0.25) microg/ml in group 1 and group 4, respectively. Significantly fewer changes of propofol target were required in group 4 as compared to group 1. There were no differences among the five groups for mean arterial pressure, heart rate, time to tracheal extubation, awareness, satisfaction scores, and morphine requirements.
These results suggest the BIS, as part of an algorithm that uses both the absolute BIS value and its increase following tracheal intubation, can be used to effectively titrate both propofol and sufentanil. A predicted sufentanil Ce of 1.25 ng/ml before and 0.8 ng/ml after sternotomy was associated with the lowest predicted propofol Ce and fewer changes of propofol target. Lower sufentanil concentrations required higher propofol concentrations and more frequent changes of the target propofol concentration and were associated with similar hemodynamic tolerance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12883406/

Level of sedation was assessed with the Sedation-Agitation Scale (range 1-7, unarousable to dangerous agitation) and the Bispectral Index (range 0-100, flat line to awake waveform) recorded before and after stimulation. Patients were classified as receiving continuous infusions if an infusion had been administered within 24 hours preceding assessment.
Nineteen patients were evaluated on 80 occasions. Scores on the Sedation-Agitation Scale ranged from 1 to 5 (mean 2.6 and median 2) and correlated highly with values for the Bispectral Index (R2 = 0.48 before and 0.44 after stimulation, P < .001).

Electromyographic activity influences surface electroencephalography and the calculation of BIS. In this study, we sought to determine the effect of spontaneous electromyographic activity on BIS. BIS was monitored in three volunteers by using an Aspect A-1000 monitor. The experiment was repeated in one volunteer. Electromyographic activity was recorded. Alcuronium and succinylcholine were administered. No other drugs were used. In parallel with spontaneous electromyographic activity of the facial muscles, BIS decreased in response to muscle relaxation to a minimum value of 33 and, in the repeated measurement, to a minimum value of 9 when total neuromuscular block was achieved. In two volunteers, no total block was achieved. BIS decreased to a minimal value of 64 and 57, respectively. In turn, recovery of BIS coincided with the reappearance of spontaneous electromyographic activity. During the entire experiment, the volunteers had full consciousness. BIS, assessed by software Version 3.31, correlates with spontaneous electromyographic activity of the facial muscles. BIS failed to detect awareness in completely paralyzed subjects. Thus, in paralyzed patients, BIS monitoring may not reliably indicate a decline in sedation and imminent awareness.
The bispectral index (BIS) is an electroencephalographic variable intended for measuring depth of anesthesia. Electromyographic activity influences the calculation of BIS. We found that the administration of a muscle relaxant to unanesthetized volunteers decreases the bispectral index value. Thus, awareness in totally paralyzed patients cannot be excluded.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12873942/

The authors prospectively investigated 45 patients who were continuously sedated with midazolam and sufentanil to achieve a Sedation-Agitation Scale value equal to 1 and who required administration of muscle relaxant. BIS (BIS version 2.10), electromyography, and acceleromyography at the adductor pollicis muscle were recorded simultaneously before and after neuromuscular blockade. Sixteen of these 45 patients were also studied simultaneously with the new BIS XP.
After administration of a muscle relaxant, BIS (67 +/- 19 vs. 43 +/- 10, P < 0.001) and electromyographic activity (37 +/- 9 vs. 27 +/- 3 dB, P < 0.001) significantly decreased. Multiple regression analysis showed that the decrease of BIS following administration of myorelaxant was significantly correlated to BIS and electromyographic baseline values. Using standard BIS range guidelines, the number of patients under light or deep sedation versus general anesthesia or deep hypnotic state was markedly overestimated before administration of myorelaxant (53 vs. 2%, P < 0.001).
The BIS in sedated intensive care unit patients may be lower with paralysis for an equivalent degree of sedation because of high muscular activity. The magnitude of BIS overestimation is significantly correlated to both BIS and electromyographic activity before neuromuscular blockade.

The peripheral nervous system is vulnerable in the setting of neuro-muscular blockade (NMB), related drug-drug interactions, and drug-clinical state interactions. Optimal assessment of the nervous system is done by means of the clinical neurological examination. In this manner, orientation, arousal, and responsiveness to stimulation provide feedback on focal and global stability of the central nervous system. Where clinical evaluation is compromised, such as with deep sedation and NMB, risk of undetected seizure activity, and/or progression of neurological injury increases dramatically. A patient receiving NMB risks breakthrough awareness and pain. Long-term complications of NMB including prolonged weakness or paralysis as well as post-traumatic stress dramatically increase morbidity and length of stay. Technologies such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and bispectral index (BIS trade mark ) monitoring are effective for assessing cerebral function as well as level of sedation or arousal, respectively, in patients with a compromised neurological assessment. Neuromuscular transmission (NMT) monitoring by means of peripheral nerve stimulation and assessment of the evoked response may be utilized, within the context of clinical assessment, to determine level of chemical paralysis and minimize dosing of NMB agents. This article explores utilization and differentiates technologies such as EEG, BIS, and NMT monitoring. Monitoring parameters are illustrated using a case study approach.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12819456/
12818940,Validation of the bispectral index monitor during conscious and deep sedation in children.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2003,"McDermott NB, VanSickle T, Motas D, Friesen RH","In this study, we tested the validity of the bispectral index (BIS) monitor during conscious and deep sedation of children by comparing it with the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS), a validated observational pediatric sedation scale. Eighty-six children <12 yr of age were enrolled in this observational study. The subjects underwent conscious or deep sedation administered by non-anesthesiologists for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in four departments in a children's hospital. Sedation medications varied among departments and were not controlled by the study protocol. An independent observer derived a UMSS score at 10-min intervals for 1 h during sedation; personnel administering sedation medications and performing the procedures were blinded to the BIS and UMSS scores. Significant correlation between BIS scores and UMSS scores was found (r = -0.704, P < 0.0001), including in subjects <6 mo of age (n = 6) (r = -0.761, P < 0.001). Poor correlation was found when ketamine or an oral combination of chloral hydrate, hydroxyzine, and meperidine were used for sedation. We conclude that BIS correlates well with UMSS scores and may be a valid measure of conscious and deep sedation in children.
We compared bispectral index scores with a validated observational scale of conscious and deep sedation in children and found significant correlation. We conclude that the bispectral index may be a valid measurement of depth of sedation in children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12818940/

This study was designed to assess the effects of bispectral index monitoring on sevoflurane and its recovery profiles.
Sixty ASA I and II patients undergoing open abdominal surgery were randomized into two groups: one monitored using the bispectral index (Group BIS) and the other without its use (controls). After a standardized induction, anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in both groups. In Group BIS, sevoflurane was titrated to maintain the bispectral index in the range 40-60. In the control group, the administered sevoflurane concentration was adjusted according to the signs of anaesthesia. The end-tidal sevoflurane concentration, bispectral index and routine haemodynamic variables were noted every 5 min during surgery. The consumption of sevoflurane was computed. At the conclusion of surgery operations, the time to 'open eyes on verbal command', 'motor response to verbal command' and Aldrete's score were recorded by a blinded anaesthesiologist.
The difference in the consumption of sevoflurane was not significant between the groups. Bispectral index monitoring was associated with a reduction of 4.73% in sevoflurane usage and 2.19 mL h(-1) was saved.

We used bispectral index and an observer scale to assess sedation after two different doses of i.t. clonidine in patients with or without spinal cord injury. Twelve patients with neurological deficit caused by trauma (Spinal Cord Injury, SCI) were compared with patients without neurological disease. They received 10 mg of i.t. bupivacaine with clonidine, with either 50 microg (low dose, n=6) or 150 microg (high dose, n=6) at L(2)-L(3). A further 12 patients, six with spinal trauma lesion and six healthy, received i.t. bupivacaine and 150 micro g of i.m. clonidine.
Sedation and a decrease in BIS occurred only in patients receiving 150 microg of clonidine. Onset of sedation and the decrease in BIS was delayed in most spinal cord injured patients whatever the route of administration (P<0.001). Duration of sedation was not different between the groups. Delayed sedation and decrease of BIS after i.t. clonidine in patients with spinal cord injury are similar than those observed after i.m. clonidine.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the BIS would be useful in predicting electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced seizure times and awakening from methohexital anesthesia. Twenty-five consenting patients with major depressive disorders underwent 100 maintenance ECT treatments. All patients were premedicated with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV, and anesthesia was induced with methohexital 1 mg/kg IV. The BIS was monitored continuously, and the values were recorded at specific end-points, including before anesthesia (baseline), after the induction of anesthesia (pre-ECT), at the end of ECT (peak), after ECT (suppression), and on awakening (eye opening). The pre-ECT BIS value correlated with the duration of both the motor (r = 0.3) and EEG (r = 0.4) seizure activity (P < 0.05). The peak post-ECT BIS value correlated with the duration of the EEG seizure activity (r = 0.5) (P < 0.05). A positive correlation was also found between the EEG seizure duration and the time to eye opening (r = 0.4) (P < 0.05). However, the BIS values on awakening from methohexital anesthesia varied from 29 to 97 and were <60 in 75% of the cases. We conclude that the BIS value before the ECT stimulus is applied could be useful in predicting the seizure time. However, the BIS values on awakening were highly variable, suggesting that it reflects both the residual depressant effects of methohexital and post-ictal depression.
The bispectral index (BIS) value immediately before the electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) stimulus correlates with the duration of the motor and electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure activity during methohexital anesthesia. In addition, the increase in the BIS value during the ECT-induced seizure was proportional to the duration of EEG seizure activity. However, the BIS value on awakening from anesthesia varied widely, from 29 to 97.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12760987/

Prospective, open-label study.
Operating room of a university hospital.
28 patients, aging 20 to 50 years, scheduled for elective, 1- to 4-hour surgeries under general anesthesia.
BIS was continuously monitored from bifrontal montage (At1-Fpz and At2-Fpz) using an Aspect A-1,050 EEG system (Aspect, Natick, MA). Anesthesia was induced with bolus injections of fentanyl 2 microg/kg and propofol 2 mg/kg, and maintained with intermittent injections of fentanyl and constant infusion of propofol. Propofol infusion was stopped at the end of surgery.
Consciousness and orientation were assessed as clinical endpoints once every 2 minutes following the end of the surgery. Blood samples were extracted for plasma propofol and fentanyl concentrations (PCp and FCp, respectively), and BIS values were recorded when patients regained consciousness and orientation. Patients were allocated to one of three groups depending on FCp on awakening: Group 1, FCp > 1 microg/L (n = 8); Group 2, FCp < 1 microg/L and >0.45 microg/L (n = 9); and Group 3, FCp < 0.45 microg/L (n = 11). PCp, BIS, recovery time, and other data were compared between the three groups.
Demographic values, duration of surgery, and consumption of propofol and fentanyl were not different between the three groups. Group 3 patients regained consciousness with significantly higher propofol concentration (mean PCp = 3.2 mg/L) compared with those in Groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.05). However, the BIS values at both recovery endpoints were not different among the three groups.
The plasma levels of fentanyl affect the concentrations of propofol required for patients to regain consciousness. The BIS values for wakefulness are unaltered at the different combinations of propofol and fentanyl concentrations. Thus, the BIS appears to be a useful and consistent indicator for level of consciousness during emergence from propofol/fentanyl intravenous anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12719048/

In a prospective, randomized trial, 100 adult patients received either conscious analgesia/sedation (Sedation group) or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA group). Analgesia/sedation was achieved by infusion of remifentanil (0.20 to 0.25 microg/kg/min) and propofol in titrated doses. TIVA was induced by intravenous administration of fentanyl (2 microg/kg), midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) and propofol (dosage titrated). Cardiorespiratory parameters and bispectral index were monitored and recorded. The quality of the analgesia was assessed with a Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NRS); recovery level and return of psychomotor efficiency were evaluated with, respectively, the Aldrete scale and a Modified Post Anesthesia Discharge Scoring (MPADS) system.
Both groups of 50 patients were comparable with respect to demographic data, initial parameters, and duration of colonoscopy. All patients in the TIVA group found the colonoscopy painless (NRS score 0). In the Sedation group, the average pain intensity score was 0.4 (0.8). There was a marked difference between the Sedation and TIVA groups with respect to the time from the end of the procedure until the maximum MPADS score was reached: respectively, -6.9 (4.0) versus 25.7 (8.4) minutes (p < 0.001). In the TIVA group, changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate and signs of respiratory depression were significant (p < 0.05).

We studied 36 patients with Alzheimer's disease or multiinfarct dementia and 36 control patients aged >75 yr. Both groups were assessed with a Mini-Mental State Test. BIS (version 3.4) was recorded from a frontal derivation using an Aspect A-2000 EEG monitor. Off-line data analysis was also performed with the newer version 4.0 of the BIS algorithm. Fourteen of 36 (38%) dementia patients and 4 of 36 (11%) controls had mean baseline BIS 3.4 <93 (P = 0.006). Eighteen of 36 (50%) dementia patients and 8 of 36 (22%) controls had mean BIS 4.0 <93 (P = 0.026). Mean (95% confidence interval) BIS 3.4 was 92.9 (91-95) in the dementia and 96.1 (95-97) in the control group (P = 0.02). Values with BIS 4.0 were, respectively, 89.1 (86-92) and 94.7 (93-96) (P = 0.002). No significant difference was found in age, sex, activity from the electromyogram, and signal quality index. As expected, the difference in Mini-Mental State Test scores was significant (P < 0.0001). A significant proportion of patients with dementia shows a low baseline BIS. The utility of the BIS monitor in detecting dementia warrants further investigation.

Depth of anesthesia may influence the neuro-hormonal release, including catecholamines. Opioids depress general sympathetic activation in a dose-dependent manner. We investigated the hypothesis that remifentanil would depress the catecholamine response to pneumoperitoneum and laparoscopic surgery differently with a high dose (HD) compared with a low dose (LD).
In a randomized, prospective study we investigated 18 ASA I-II patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication with an intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mmHg. The patients were randomized to receive either a LD (0.13 microg kg-1x min-1) or HD (0.39 microg kg-1 x min-1) of remifentanil with a target-controlled infusion (TCI) technique. Bispectral index of EEG (BIS) was maintained at 40-55 by propofol delivered by a TCI system. Arterial catecholamines were analyzed at different times during the procedure.
Norepinephrine increased equally in both groups during pneumoperitoneum and surgical intervention. Epinephrine stayed low in the HD-group, while increasing during surgery in the LD-group.
High dose of remifentanil depressed the epinephrine response to pneumoperitoneum and surgery, indicating no general activation of the sympathetic nervous system.

This study was designed to evaluate the predictive performance of spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), BIS, and approximate entropy for the response to increasingly intense stimuli under different concentrations of both propofol and remifentanil in the therapeutic range.
Ten healthy male and ten healthy female volunteers were studied during coadministration of propofol and remifentanil. After having maintained a specific target concentration for 10 min, the depth of sedation-anesthesia was assessed using the responsiveness component of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) rating scale, which was modified by adding insertion of a laryngeal mask and laryngoscopy. The electroencephalogram derived parameters approximate entropy, bispectral index, and SEF95 were recorded just before sedation level was assessed.
The prediction probability values for approximate entropy were slightly, but not significantly, better than those for bispectral index, SEF95, and the combination of drug concentrations. A much lower prediction ability was observed for tolerance of airway manipulation than for hypnotic endpoints.

The BIS value was recorded before applying pressure on the extra 1 point, during pressure application every 30 s for 10 min, and after pressure release. Regarding the control point, BIS values were recorded for 5 instead of 10 min during pressure application because acupressure on that point was associated with an unpleasant feeling.

Another group of patients were sedated with a propofol infusion to maintain BIS at 60 +/- 5 and were administered IV saline (placebo group; n = 20), droperidol 1 mg (dro-1 group; n = 20), or droperidol 2 mg (dro-2 group; n = 20) in a randomized order and in a double-blinded fashion. Although BIS remained the same in the conscious and placebo groups, it significantly decreased after administration of droperidol in the dro-1 and dro-2 groups.

We studied 21 women during a two-stage awakening (sevoflurane washout followed by remifentanil washout) after anesthesia for gynecological surgery. All were amnesic, and 19 were unresponsive to verbal command with remifentanil alone. In six patients, BIS decreased paradoxically as the remifentanil concentration decreased; this was caused by a low-amplitude EEG, which was misinterpreted by the Aspect algorithm as burst suppression. Most of the EEG/AEP variables were sensitive to the decrease in sevoflurane and the recovery of consciousness, but not to the effects of decreasing remifentanil concentrations. SVDEN was the only variable that demonstrated significant increases for both the sevoflurane and remifentanil washout phases. With the prediction probability statistic during remifentanil washout, SVDEN = 0.79, spectral entropy = 0.81, A-Line ARX AEP index = 0.63, and BIS = 0.58. Entropy measures appear to be worthy of further clinical evaluation in a larger series of patients. SVDEN may be a useful variable for assessing anesthetic and analgesic effects on the central nervous system.
During the recovery phase from a remifentanil-based anesthetic, the bispectral index is not reliably predictive of the depth of consciousness, because of suppression ratio artifacts. Entropy measures of the electroencephalogram show promise, but there is still no gold standard to estimate anesthetic depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12598252/

Sixty patients after major operations were allocated randomly to receive either desflurane or propofol. The target level of sedation was defined by a bispectral index(TM) (BIS(TM)) of 60. All patients were receiving mechanical ventilation of the lungs for 10.6 (SD 5.5) h depending on their clinical state. The study drugs were stopped abruptly in a calm atmosphere with the fresh gas flow set to 6 litres min(-1), and the time until the BIS increased above 75 was measured (t(BIS75), the main objective measure). After extubation of the trachea, when the patients could state their birth date, they were asked to memorize five words.
Emergence times were shorter (P<0.001) after desflurane than after propofol (25th, 50th and 75th percentiles): t(BIS75), 3.0, 4.5 and 5.8 vs 5.2, 7.7 and 10.3 min; time to first response, 3.7, 5.0 and 5.7 vs 6.9, 8.6 and 10.7 min; time to eyes open, 4.7, 5.7 and 8.0 vs 7.3, 10.5 and 20.8 min; time to squeeze hand, 5.1, 6.5 and 10.2 vs 9.2, 11.1 and 21.1 min; time to tracheal extubation, 5.8, 7.7 and 10.0 vs 9.7, 13.5 and 18.9 min; time to saying their birth date, 7.7, 10.5 and 15.5 vs 13.0, 19.4 and 31.8 min. Patients who received desflurane recalled significantly more of the five words. We did not observe major side-effects and there were no haemodynamic or laboratory changes except for a more marked increase in systolic blood pressure after stopping desflurane. Using a low fresh gas flow (air/oxygen 1 litre min(-1)), pure drug costs were lower for desflurane than for propofol (95 vs 171 Euros day(-1)).
We found shorter and more predictable emergence times and quicker mental recovery after short-term postoperative sedation with desflurane compared with propofol. Desflurane allows precise timing of extubation, shortening the time during which the patient needs very close attention.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12594136/
12548274,A study of the Bispectral Index Monitor during procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department.,Annals of emergency medicine,2003,"Gill M, Green SM, Krauss B","The Bispectral Index Monitor has been validated as an objective measure of sedation depth in the operating room; however, its value for states other than general anesthesia remains unclear. We hypothesized that bispectral index monitoring would reliably correlate with traditional definitions of sedation depth in emergency department patients undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia.
In this prospective observational study we measured the Bispectral Index score and a modified Ramsay Sedation Scale score every 5 minutes in a convenience sample of adult ED patients undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia. Investigators and treating physicians were blinded to Bispectral Index scores, which were later correlated with modified Ramsay Sedation Scale scores. We constructed receiver operating characteristic curves to determine the most discriminatory Bispectral Index score thresholds for sedation depth.
Two hundred seventy paired readings were obtained from 37 patients. Despite being statistically significant (P <.0005), the correlation between the Bispectral Index Monitor and modified Ramsay Sedation Scale scores was only moderate (Spearman rho=-0.690) and displayed wide variability. A modified Ramsay Sedation Scale score consistent with mild-to-moderate sedation corresponded to Bispectral Index scores of 34 (general anesthesia) to 98 (fully awake), whereas a modified Ramsay Sedation Scale score consistent with deep sedation corresponded to Bispectral Index scores of 40 to 98. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated moderate (0.83 to 0.86) discriminatory power at all modified Ramsay Sedation Scale thresholds, with the exception of a modified Ramsay Sedation Scale score of 7 or less, which demonstrated high discriminatory power (0.95). A Bispectral Index score of greater than 83 reliably excluded general anesthesia, and a Bispectral Index score of 70 or less reliably identified general anesthesia.
Bispectral index monitoring reliably predicted patients undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia who were sedated to the point of general anesthesia from those with lesser degrees of sedation but did not discriminate mild-to-moderate sedation or moderate-to-deep sedation, as measured by the Ramsay Sedation Scale score for the patients undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia in our ED.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12548274/

Scoring systems commonly used still show some limitation; the introduction of Bispectral Index (an EEG parameter) could bring potential advantages in monitoring sedation. According to the reports, Bispectral Index correlates with levels of sedation on the Ramsay Scale. We report our personal experience in this topic.
Twenty patients, diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), were involved in the study. For an optimal adaptation to respiratory prothesis, they were sedated (with Propofol by continuous infusion at an initial dose of 2 mg/kg/h, which could be modulated with steps of 0.5 mg/kg/h), in order to maintain a Ramsay score of 4-5. BIS value was continuously recorded, and manually calculated on a mean average of a minute during the measuring of Ramsay score (T0) and every 30' for 24 hours on par with Ramsay score. EEG, SpO2, non invasive arterial pressure, ventilatory module, ETCO2, FIO2 were also recorded. For the statistic analysis, Friedman test and Spearman coefficient were utilized. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.
980 observations were carried out. The variation range of Ramsay Score was between 2 and 6. BIS range varied from 34 to 98. Statistic analysis of the data obtained pointed out some significative correlations, particularly between Ramsay Score and BIS (p < 0.01), and between BIS and dosage of Propofol (p < 0.01).
The results of the study are consistent with those found in the literature on this topic of study. In fact, this study demonstrates the utility of BIS to track levels of consciousness in ICU patients while still maintaining the use of the score systems to care for ICU patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12546259/

Less is known about the relative potency of anesthetic drugs in suppressing cortical and spinal electrophysiological responses in vivo in humans, particularly those, but not only those, connected with motor responses. Therefore, we studied the effects of sevoflurane and propofol in humans using multimodal electrophysiological assessment.
We studied nine healthy volunteers in two sessions during steady state sedation with 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 microg/l (targeted plasma concentration) propofol or 0.2 and 0.4 vol% (end-tidal) sevoflurane. Following a 15-min equilibration period, motor responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation and peripheral (H-reflex, F-wave) stimulation were recorded, while electroencephalography and auditory evoked responses were recorded in parallel.
At concentrations corresponding to two thirds of C(50 awake), motor responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation were reduced by approximately 50%, H-reflex amplitude was reduced by 22%, F-wave amplitude was reduced by 40%, and F-wave persistence was reduced by 25%. No significant differences between sevoflurane and propofol were found. At this concentration, the Bispectral Index was reduced by 7%, and the middle-latency auditory evoked responses were attenuated only mildly (N(b) latency increased by 11%, amplitude P(a)N(b) did not change). In contrast, the postauricular reflex was suppressed by 77%.
The large effect of both anesthetics on all spinal motor responses, compared with the small effect on electroencephalography and middle-latency auditory evoked responses, assuming that they represent cortical modulation, may suggest that the suppression of motor responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation is largely due to submesencephalic effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12459667/

We designed this observational study to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSI with that of the bispectral index (BIS) with respect to their ability to predict the loss of consciousness and emergence from anesthesia, as well as to assess changes in IV (propofol) and inhaled (desflurane) anesthetics during the maintenance period. Twenty consenting patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic surgical procedures were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg IV and fentanyl 1 micro g/kg IV, and tracheal intubation was facilitated with cisatracurium 0.3 mg/kg IV. Desflurane 4% in combination with nitrous oxide 60% in oxygen was administered for the maintenance of anesthesia. Comparative PSI and BIS values were obtained at specific time intervals during the induction, maintenance, and emergence periods. The changes in these indices were recorded after the administration of propofol (20 mg IV) or with 2% increases or decreases in the inspired concentration of desflurane during the maintenance period. With logistic regression models, both the BIS and PSI were found to be effective as predictors of unconsciousness (i.e., failed to respond to verbal stimuli) (P < 0.01). The PSI also correlated with the BIS during both the induction of (r = 0.78) and emergence from (r = 0.73) general anesthesia. However, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detection of consciousness indicated a better performance with the PSI (0.95 +/- 0.04) than the BIS (0.79 +/- 0.04). During the maintenance period, the PSI values were comparable to the BIS in response to changes in propofol and desflurane but displayed greater interpatient variability. Finally, the PSI (versus BIS) values were less interfered with by the electrocautery unit during surgery (16% versus 65%, respectively). In conclusion, the PSI may prove to be a viable alternative to the BIS for evaluating consciousness during the induction of and emergence from general anesthesia, as well as for titrating the administration of propofol and desflurane during the maintenance period. However, further studies with the PSA device are needed to determine its role in anesthesia.
The patient state index could be a useful alternative to the bispectral index for assessing level of consciousness during the induction of and emergence from anesthesia, as well as for titrating IV and volatile anesthetics during surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12456436/

The BIS values were recorded after midazolam premedication; after the induction of anesthesia; at end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations of 1%, 3%, and again at 1%; and after emergence from the anesthetic. Both groups were similar in age and sex distribution, but children in Group I weighed less than those in Group II (P < 0.05). The BIS values were significantly lower in Group I compared with Group II after sedation, at 1% sevoflurane concentrations, and after emergence. No difference was observed between the two groups at anesthesia induction (8%) and at 3% sevoflurane concentration.

Fifty patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy received combined epidural and general anesthesia or general anesthesia alone with isoflurane and alfentanil. Isoflurane was administered by computer-controlled closed-loop feedback to maintain an EEG 95% spectral edge frequency of 17.5 Hz, a target chosen on the basis of a pilot study. In epidural patients, end-tidal isoflurane concentration (FE'(ISO)) was 0.19% smaller (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.32% to -0.06%; P < 0.01), mean arterial blood pressure was 17 mm Hg lower (95% CI, -24 to -9 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), and body temperature was 0.4 degrees C lower (95% CI, -0.7 to 0 degrees C; P < 0.05) than in controls. EEG bispectral index (BIS) was 4 points higher (95% CI, 1 to 7; P < 0.05). EEG median frequency and heart rate were similar in both groups. Epidural patients were 76% more likely (95% CI, 58% to 94%; P < 0.001) to require metaraminol for hypotension and were 28% more likely (95% CI, 3% to 53%; P < 0.05) to require glycopyrrolate for bradycardia. After surgery, the time to eye opening in epidural patients was 2.3 min shorter (95% CI, -4.2 to -0.5 min; P < 0.05).

To maintain similar intraoperative spectral edge frequency, patients receiving combined epidural and general anesthesia require 21% less isoflurane than those receiving general anesthesia alone. This smaller isoflurane dose is associated with faster emergence from anesthesia.
The dose of general anesthetic required to maintain similar intraoperative suppression of brain electrical activity is 21% less in patients with nerve blockade than in those without. This dose reduction results in faster waking times in patients with nerve blockade, which may reflect lighter intraoperative anesthesia.

The assumption is made that patients sleep when their pain is relieved. Some patients complain of persistent pain when they awake. We studied the time-course of sedation and analgesia to understand the determinants of patients' sleep during morphine titration.
Seventy-three patients requiring morphine titration in a post-anaesthetic care unit after major surgery, were studied. Fifty-two patients slept (Sleep group) and 21 did not (Awake group). When a patient slept during titration, morphine was discontinued. Visual analogue pain scale (VAS), Ramsay score (RS), and the bispectral index (BIS) were recorded at the beginning of titration (STonset), at sleep onset (STsleep), then 5, 10, 20, and 30 min afterwards (ST4).
In the Sleep group, mean (SD) RS increased from 1.7 (0.4) to 2.4 (0.6) (P<0.05 vs STonset) and BIS decreased from 95 (5.0) to 89.8 (10.2) between STonset and STsleep (P<0.05), RS remained stable thereafter. Conversely, RS and BIS remained unaltered in the Awake group. The reduction in VAS was comparable between groups (from 78 (17) to 39 (21), and from 64 (16) to 30.4 (11), respectively). Even though mean (SD) VAS was 39 (21) at ST4 in the Sleep group, 13 patients (25%) maintained a VAS above 50 mm.

The average midazolam dose in the midazolam group over the treatment period was 0.01 mg/kg/h, and the average midazolam plus ketamine dose was 0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg/h, respectively. Mean BIS values throughout the sedation study period were 90 for the midazolam group and 94 for the midazolam plus ketamine group. The addition of ketamine did not lower BIS. BIS values did not alter significantly over time except for an expected transient drop after the midazolam bolus induction.
BIS levels remained close to baseline levels, suggesting that BIS would not provided any additional benefit to currently established methods of monitoring patient consciousness during conscious sedation for oral surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12374913/

Although the electrophysiologic (EP) effects of isoflurane- and propofol-based anesthetics have been shown to be similar, a retrospective analysis reported significantly longer RFCA procedural duration with the use of isoflurane. It remains unclear whether the ability to successfully perform RFCA differs between these drugs.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either an isoflurane- or propofol-maintained anesthetic. Drug administration was titrated according to the pharmacodynamic endpoint of depth of sedation using bispectral index score. The ability to induce sustained tachycardia (using a scoring system), procedural durations, and effects on cardiac electrophysiologic properties were evaluated and compared between the groups.
Sixty subjects were included in this study. Sustained supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) was inducible with the assigned drug in all but four subjects. In three of these four subjects, SVT was also not inducible with the alternative study drug. Ability to induce the first sustained SVT was similar between the groups (P = 0.83). Total procedural durations were similar (isoflurane 224 +/- 84 min vs. propofol 221 +/- 86 min, mean +/- SD, P = 0.88). Atrioventricular nodal conduction was slower with propofol compared with isoflurane, but this result did not appear to be clinically relevant. Finally, ventricular repolarization was prolonged by isoflurane versus propofol, the clinical significance of which was not demonstrated.
Isoflurane- and propofol-based anesthesia were equally suitable in children and adolescents undergoing RFCA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12170051/

A third expression of memory (unconscious-controlled memory) was recently observed after moderate to light sedation (BIS, 70-80). The present study investigated memory function during deep sedation (BIS, 60-70). As memory effects are small, the authors studied potential predictors of individual differences in memory performance.
Memory function and speed of information processing were assessed in 56 outpatients before surgery. During propofol anesthesia supplemented with alfentanil, patients heard a series of words while anesthesia was titrated to BIS, 60-70. In between words, response to command was assessed using the Isolated Forearm Technique. The authors tested memory with a word stem completion task and process dissociation procedure to distinguish explicit from implicit effects.
Mean (+/- SD) BIS during word presentation was 64.0 +/- 3. Patients with conscious recall of verbal commands (n = 9) did not recall or recognize presented words. Even so, the process dissociation procedure revealed evidence of memory by a significantly higher hit rate in the inclusion condition (0.26) than in the exclusion condition (0.12). Patients without conscious recall showed no evidence of memory for presented words. Hit scores correlated significantly with scores in the preoperative memory test (r = 0.35).
The authors found evidence of weak explicit memory function during anesthesia titrated to BIS, 60-70. The observations strongly suggest that postoperative memory relates to awareness during anesthesia, but the nature of this relation remains unclear. Memory seems more likely in patients with good preoperative memory performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12151928/

Secondary comparison end points were time to achieve and terminate sedation and postoperative analgesia and psychomotor performance. Forty patients scheduled for elective surgery provided informed consent and were randomized equally to receive either dexmedetomidine (1 microg/kg initial loading dose for 10 min; maintenance, 0.4-0.7 microg. kg(-1). h(-1)) or propofol (75 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) x 10 min; maintenance, 12.5-75 microg. kg(-1). min(-1)). Hemodynamic variables (heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure), sedation (visual analog scale and Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation), bispectral index score of sedation, ventilation (respiratory rate, O2 sat, and ETCO2), psychomotor performance (digital symbol substitution test), and pain (visual analog scale) were determined during surgery and up to 95 min after surgery. Intraoperative sedation levels were targeted to achieve a bispectral index score of 70-80. Patient demographics, ASA class, surgical procedure, and baseline cardio-respiratory variables were similar between groups. Sedation was achieved more rapidly with propofol but was similar between groups 25 min after initiating infusions. The average infusion rate for dexmedetomidine was 0.7 microg. kg(-1). h(-1) and 38 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) for propofol. There were no differences between groups in psychomotor performance and respiratory rate during recovery. The previous use of dexmedetomidine resulted in more sedation, lower blood pressure, and improved analgesia (less morphine use) in recovery.
Dexmedetomidine may be useful for perioperative sedation. It has a slower onset and offset of sedation compared with propofol. Dexmedetomidine was associated with improved analgesia and less morphine use in the postoperative period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12145072/

When an outgoing sympathetic nervous burst occurs to the skin, the palmar and plantar sweat glands are filled up, and the SC increases before the sweat is removed and the SC decreases. This creates a SC fluctuation. The purpose of this study was to measure SC during laparoscopic cholecystectomy with propofol and remifentanil anesthaesia and to evaluate whether number and amplitude of SC fluctuations correlate with perioperative stress monitoring.
Eleven patients were studied nine times before, during and after anaesthesia. SC was compared to changes in stress measures such as blood pressure, heart rate, norepinephrine and epinephrine levels. SC was also compared to changes in Bispectral index (BIS).
The blood pressure, epinephrine levels and norepinephrine levels were positively correlated with both the number (P < 0.001) and amplitude (P < 0.01) of the SC fluctuations. Moreover, the BIS was positively correlated with the number (P < 0.001) and amplitude (P < 0.001) of the SC fluctuations. Furthermore, during tracheal intubation, the mean levels of the number of SC fluctuations from the 11 patients had the same stress response as measured in changes of the mean levels of norepinephrine. The mean BIS did not show any stress response during tracheal intubation.

This could contribute to the antiemetic potential of subhypnotic doses of propofol. On the contrary, subhypnotic doses of propofol used for sedation could decrease GE and thus favor regurgitation and pulmonary inhalation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of low-dose propofol infusion on GE.
On three separate occasions, 10 volunteers received either a propofol infusion at a rate set to achieve a target plasma concentration of 0.5 microg/ml or equivalent volumes of 10% Intralipid(R) or 0.9% saline. GE for solids was measured by using the octanoic acid breath test. An acetaminophen absorption technique measured the GE rate for liquids. Blood samples were assayed for acetaminophen and propofol. Breath samples were analyzed for (13)CO(2) concentration by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Carbon dioxide production (VCO(2)) was measured instead of calculated by indirect calorimetry. Sedation was evaluated by the Bispectral Index of the electroencephalogram.
Propofol blood concentrations were 0.32 +/- 0.20 and 0.45 +/- 0.18 microg/ml at 60 and 165 min, respectively. These concentrations were not sedative. Propofol or its solvent did not modify GE for solids or liquids. In all groups, differences in GE were obtained if measured VCO(2) was integrated in the formula instead of calculated VCO(2) (P < 0.002).
Subhypnotic doses of propofol known to be antiemetic do not inhibit GE. These results suggest that the antiemetic properties of propofol are not peripheral and that propofol cannot be considered as a prokinetic agent. V(13)CO(2) must be measured instead of calculated to accurately determine GE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12131109/

A convenience sample of 20 adult, critically ill patients with a decreased level of consciousness. The data from one patient were excluded because the patient did not meet inclusion criteria.
Patients were prospectively evaluated by a blinded observer using the SAS to subjectively determine their level of consciousness. Sedation levels varied from unarousable (SAS score of 1), to very sedated (SAS score of 2), to mildly sedated (SAS score of 3). Simultaneously, the patients were continuously monitored for 4-6 hrs with the BIS device. There was wide variability in BIS scores for any given level of consciousness as compared with the SAS. Unarousable patients had BIS scores ranging from 23 to 97, with a median score of 50 and an interquartile range of 24. Very sedated patients had BIS scores ranging from 35 to 98, with a median score of 68 and an interquartile range of 36. Mildly sedated patients had BIS scores ranging from 67 to 91, with a median score of 76 and an interquartile range of 8. Overall, there was a less than satisfactory correlation between BIS values and SAS scores (r =.36, p <.001). However, the correlation improved with subgroup analysis when BIS values associated with excessive muscle movement were excluded (r =.50, p <.001).
The correlation between SAS and BIS scores was suboptimal and inconsistent in a heterogeneous group of critically ill patients. The generation of BIS hardware and software, studied herein, is neither reliable nor valid for routinely monitoring the level of consciousness in the critically ill patient. Excessive muscle movement by the patient is an important and spurious influence on BIS values and seriously undermines BIS reliability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12130966/

Although flurbiprofen, a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, is used clinically as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent and postoperative analgesic, it reduces prostaglandin production. Thus, this agent may affect the depth of sedation during general anaesthesia. In this study, we examined if flurbiprofen affects the bispectral index, which correlates with sedation levels.
Fifteen patients who underwent elective surgery under total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and fentanyl were studied. The sedation level was monitored using a bispectral index monitor. On attainment of stable haemodynamics and a bispectral index, patients were given flurbiprofen axetil 50 mg intravenously.

60 healthy adult patients (aged 20-50 yrs) scheduled for elective surgery with general anesthesia.
During a TCI of propofol (n = 30) or thiopental (n = 30), clinical endpoints for loss of verbal responsiveness (LOV), loss-of-eyelash reflex (LOE), occurrence of yawning, and apnea were assessed at 15-second intervals. In addition, BIS and C(E) values were recorded at each of the endpoints.
In both anesthetic groups, the sequence of occurrence of the clinical endpoints was similar, namely LOV, LOE, yawning, and, lastly, apnea. Compared with LOV and LOE, yawning was associated with lower BIS and higher C(E) values with both anesthetics. The frequency of yawning was higher with thiopental than propofol (83% vs. 63%, respectively). However, the frequency of apnea was higher with propofol than thiopental (77% vs. 53%, respectively).
The correlation of the clinical endpoints with BIS and C(E) values was highest for LOV. Yawning was as unreliable as LOE for determining the onset of unconsciousness during induction of anesthesia.

The present study investigates the use of a neural network technique to obtain a non-proprietary index of the depth of anaesthesia from the processed EEG data.
Two hundred patients, who underwent general abdominal surgery, were recruited for our trial. For anaesthesia we used a total i.v. technique, tracheal intubation, and artificial ventilation. Fourteen EEG variables, including the BIS, were extracted from the EEG, monitored with an EEG computerized monitor, and then stored on a computer. Data from 150 patients were used to train the neural network. All the variables, excluding the BIS, were used as input data in the neural network. The output targets of the network were provided by anaesthesia scores ranging from 10 to 100 assigned by the anaesthesiologist according to the observer's assessment of alertness and sedation (OAA/S) and other clinical means of assessing depth of anaesthesia. Data from the other 50 patients were used to test the model and for statistical analysis.
The artificial neural network was successfully trained to predict an anaesthesia depth index, the NED (neural network evaluated depth), ranging from 0 to 100. The correlation coefficient between the NED and the BIS over the test set was 0.94 (P<0.0001).

We designed this study to examine the effect of remifentanil on BIS during combined regional/general propofol anesthesia under steady-state conditions. After Human Investigations Committee approval, 19 healthy ASA physical status I or II patients were enrolled in a prospective experimental design. Regional anesthesia was initiated and general anesthesia induced by using computer-assisted continuous infusion of propofol. Propofol was incrementally adjusted to a BIS of approximately 60. After 20 min at a stable propofol infusion rate, a remifentanil computer-assisted continuous infusion (effect-site target concentration of 0.5, 2.5, and then 10 ng/mL) was sequentially administered at stepped 15-min intervals.

All groups required similar doses of thiopental (5 mg/kg); the time of evaluation, but not epidural treatment, had a significant effect (P < 0.0001) on BIS and MAP. After tracheal intubation, MAP and BIS increased by 18% and 49%, respectively (P < 0.05). In the bupivacaine groups, isoflurane requirements similarly decreased by 35% (P < 0.03).

We conclude that epidural bupivacaine does not alter the thiopental dose, but it decreases isoflurane requirements by 35%. This study demonstrates that both doses of bupivacaine and fentanyl induce similar isoflurane-sparing effects. However, patients receiving 0.125% bupivacaine showed lower values of MAP when compared with controls, and thus bupivacaine 0.0625% should be favored during combined anesthesia.

We examined the adequacy of our general anaesthetic technique for avoiding explicit awareness by determining the depth of anaesthesia using Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring. Twenty ASA1 parturients having general anaesthesia for lower segment caesarean section were studied. The drugs and doses used for each anaesthetic were similar Intraoperative Bispectral Index, haemodynamic parameters, end-tidal isoflurane concentration and inspired nitrous oxide fraction were measured and the postoperative incidence of explicit awareness was assessed. All anaesthetists were blinded to the Bispectral Index value throughout the operation. The depth of anaesthesia at various stages of the operation was evaluated by recording the Bispectral Index. Patients were interviewed for any intraoperative recall or awareness at the end of operation. A median BIS of 70 or below was recorded on most occasions during surgery. The range was 52 to 70, with values reaching 60 and below at intubation, uterine incision and delivery. Haemodynamic stability was satisfactory and there was no case of uterine atony, fetal compromise or postpartum haemorrhage. No patient experienced intraoperative dreams, recall or awareness. Our current general anaesthetic technique appeared inadequate to reliably produce BIS values of less than 60 that are associated with a low risk of awareness. However, no patients experienced explicit awareness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11939437/

Bispectral index as a processed electroencephalogram parameter provides a continuous and observer-independent value reported to change with sedation. The aim of this prospective observational study was to determine the reliability and possible confounding factors of the bispectral index to assess sedation in surgical intensive care patients.
Following major surgery, bispectral index, body temperature and electromyographic activity of 44 ventilated patients were recorded. Sedation levels were assessed with Ramsay sedation score.
Although bispectral index correlated with Ramsay sedation score (-0.64; P < 0.01) we found that in deeply sedated patients temperature instability and electromyographic activity increased bispectral index. Bispectral index correlated significantly with electromyographic activity (0.80; P < 0.01) and with an increase of body temperature (0.55; P < 0.01) not only in all patients but also in clinically deeply sedated patients (0.57; P < 0.01 and 0.46; P < 0.05).

Continuous monitoring of BIS with arterial pressure and heart rate before, during, and after tracheal suction without (control period) and with an intravenous bolus of alfentanil (15 microg/kg, alfentanil period) before suction.
Steady-state BIS value was 61+/-8 for the control period and 59+/-7 for the alfentanil period. Blood pressure and heart rate were similar between baseline periods. One minute after tracheal suction, a significant increase in BIS level was observed in the control period, which remained significantly different from the alfentanil period until 10 min later. Significant higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were observed during the control period than the alfentanil period. However, no difference in Ramsay scores was observed between the two periods.
An alfentanil bolus of 15 microg/kg markedly reduced the increase in BIS values, blood pressure, and heart rate observed immediately after tracheal suction. Therefore BIS monitoring in ICU may help to improve analgesia during invasive events.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11907667/

19 consecutive patients without any central neurological diseases requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h.
BIS version 3.12 and clinical depth of sedation assessed by the modified Observers's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale, modified Glasgow Coma Scale, modified Ramsay Scale, Cook Scale, and Sedation-Agitation Scale were measured twice daily while patients were intubated and once daily after extubation until discharged from ICU.
there was a moderate correlation between BIS and each sedation score in 11 patients (58%, ""BIS patients"") and no correlation in 8 patients (42%, ""non-BIS patients""). We found no parameters distinguishing between these two groups. On average eight measurements were necessary to establish a statistical correlation. In the BIS patients the slopes of the linear regression curves showed significant differences for all BIS score combinations with increasing scattering at deeper sedation levels.
BIS is correlated only in some ICU patients with the clinical assessment of their sedation level as based on various scores. At deeper sedation levels the interindividual differences increase. There were no criteria found to distinguish patients with and without correlation.

The aim of this study was to determine if AEP stimuli have clinically significant effects on levels of consciousness and BIS values during sedation and general anaesthesia. Ten healthy adult patients were studied by measuring and recording the BIS for 6 epochs of 5 min each. The first 3 epochs took place during steady-state sedation, during which time the Observer's Assessment of Awareness/Sedation (OAA/S) score was also measured. The second 3 epochs took place during steady-state anaesthesia. During alternate epochs, patients were subjected to the auditory stimuli generated by an AEP system.

We compared dexmedetomidine with propofol in patients requiring sedation in intensive care. Twenty adult patients expected to require a minimum of 8 h artificial ventilation after surgery were randomized to receive sedation with either dexmedetomidine or propofol infusions. Additional analgesia, if required, was provided by an alfentanil infusion. Depth of sedation was monitored using both the Ramsay sedation score (RSS) and the bispectral index (BIS). Cardiovascular, respiratory, biochemical and haematological data were obtained. Patients' perceptions of their intensive care stay were assessed using the Hewitt questionnaire. Sedation was equivalent in the two groups [median (interquartile range): RSS, propofol group 5 (4-5), dexmedetomidine group 5 (4-6) (P=0.68); BIS, propofol group 53 (41-64), dexmedetomidine group 46 (36-58); P=0.32], but the propofol group received three times more alfentanil compared with patients sedated with dexmedetomidine [2.5 (2.2-2.9) mg h(-1) versus 0.8 (0.65-1.2) mg h(-1) (P=0.004)]. No differences were found in arterial pressures between the groups, but heart rate was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group [mean (SD) 75 (6) vs 90 (4) beats min(-1)]. Extubation times were similar and rapid with the use of both sedative agents [median (range) 28 (20-50) and 29 (15-50) min (P=0.63) respectively for the propofol and dexmedetomidine groups]. No adverse events related to the sedative infusions occurred in either group. Despite ventilation and intubation, patients sedated with dexmedetomidine could be easily roused to cooperate with procedures (e.g. physiotherapy, radiology) without showing irritation. From the clinician's and patient's perspectives, dexmedetomidine is a safe and acceptable sedative agent for those requiring intensive care. The rate pressure product is reduced in patients receiving dexmedetomidine, which may protect against myocardial ischaemia.

Thirty-six patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I or II were recruited, of which 12 received a target remifentanil concentration of 0 ng/ml, eight 2 ng/ml, eight 4 ng/ml, and another eight 8 ng/ml. Next (before surgery), several step-wise changes in the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (F(ET,sevo)) were performed. A data acquisition system simultaneously recorded F(ET,sevo), the raw electroencephalogram, BIS, and SEF. The authors used a combination of an effect compartment and an inhibitory sigmoid E(MAX) model to describe the relation between F(ET,sevo) and BIS, SEF, and CUP. Model parameters (t(1/2)k(e0), E(MAX), E(MIN), C(50), gamma, CUP weight factors) were estimated using the population data analysis program NONMEM. Significant remifentanil model parameter dependencies (P < 0.01) were determined.
Determined from SEF, remifentanil had no effect on t(1/2)k(e0) (1.91 +/- 0.26 min [mean +/- standard error]) but caused an increase in C(50) (baseline = 1.48 +/- 0.12%; 80% increase at 8 ng/ml) and decrease in E(MIN) (baseline = 10.8 +/- 0.6 Hz; 80% reduction at 8 ng/ml). Determined from CUP, remifentanil caused a dose-dependent decrease in t(1/2)k(e0) (baseline = 4.31 +/- 1.00 min; 60% decrease at 8 ng/ml), with no effect on C(50) (baseline = 0.88 +/- 0.13%). Determined from BIS, remifentanil caused a dose-dependent decrease in t(1/2)k(e0) (baseline value = 3.11 +/- 0.32 min; 40% decrease at 8 ng/ml), without affecting C(50) (baseline = 1.12 +/- 0.05%). Median R(2) values of the pooled data set were 0.815 for SEF, 0.933 for CUP (P < 0.01 vs. SEF), and 0.952 for BIS (P < 0.01 vs. SEF and CUP). Addition of remifentanil increased the R(2) values for CUP only.

Paralysis may therefore reduce the Bispectral Index (BIS) by alleviating artifact from muscles lying near the electrodes. Paralysis may also reduce signals from muscle stretch receptors that normally contribute to arousal. We therefore tested the hypothesis that nondepolarizing neuromuscular block reduces BIS. Ten volunteers were anesthetized with propofol at a target effect site concentration of 3.8 plus/minus 0.4 microg/mL. A mivacurium infusion was adjusted to vary the first twitch (T1) in a train-of-four to 80%, 30%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, or 2% of the prerelaxant intensity. At each randomly assigned T1, we measured BIS and frontal-temporal EMG intensity. BIS averaged 95 plus/minus 4 before induction of anesthesia, and decreased significantly to 40 plus/minus 5 after propofol administration. However, there were no significant differences at the designated block levels. Frontal-temporal EMG intensity averaged 47 plus/minus 3 dB before induction of anesthesia, and decreased significantly to 27 plus/minus 1 dB after propofol administration. However, there were no significant differences at the designated block levels. These data suggest that the BIS level and EMG tone are unaltered by mivacurium administration during propofol anesthesia.
Neuromuscular block level did not alter Bispectral Index (BIS) during propofol anesthesia, either by reducing electromyographic artifact or by decreasing afferent neuronal input. The BIS will thus comparably estimate sedation in deeply unconscious patients who are paralyzed, partially paralyzed, or unparalyzed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11867383/

After skin closure, a steady state of 0.6% inspired and end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was obtained, heart rate, blood pressure, and Bispectral index (BIS) baseline values were recorded, and physostigmine or normal saline was administered. Hemodynamics and BIS values were also recorded 5, 8, and 10 min after treatments. Anesthesia was discontinued, and orientation, sedation, sitting ability, and ""picking up matches"" scores were recorded immediately after extubation and 15 and 30 min later. No differences were found between the two groups in BIS (69, 70, 70, and 71 in the Physostigmine group versus 70, 74, 75, and 76 in the Control group) or blood pressure. Only heart rate was increased 8 min after physostigmine (P < 0.05 versus the control). Scores assessing early recovery were similar in the two groups at all time points. We conclude that physostigmine does not change BIS or enhance recovery after sevoflurane anesthesia.
This double-blinded, randomized study investigated the impact of physostigmine of BIS values during 0.6% sevoflurane anesthesia as well as in the postoperative recovery, when sevoflurane is administered as a sole anesthetic.

The bispectral index (BIS) monitor uses a modified electroencephalogram to quantify the effects of central nervous system-acting drugs on the level of consciousness. To evaluate the usefulness of the BIS monitor to predict clinical sedation levels in the PICU, we compared BIS values with simultaneously obtained clinical sedation scores in 24 mechanically ventilated pediatric patients aged 5.7 plus minus 6.1 yr. For each sedation scale used, the BIS value correlated with increasing depth of sedation (P < 0.0001) and was independent of the drug(s) used for sedation. To differentiate adequate from inadequate sedation, a BIS value <70 had a sensitivity of 0.87--0.89 and a positive predictive value of 0.68--0.84. To differentiate adequate from excessive sedation, a BIS value <50 had a sensitivity of 0.67--0.75 and a positive predictive value of 0.07--0.52. We conclude that the BIS monitor may be a useful adjunct for the assessment of sedation in PICU patients.
We demonstrate the usefulness of the bispectral index monitor for assessing sedation in pediatric intensive care unit patients.

This study was designed to investigate the assessment of the depth of anaesthesia as measured by the Narcotrend in comparison with bispectral index monitoring (BIS).
Both BIS and Narcotrend EEG electrodes were positioned on the patient's forehead as recommended by the manufacturers. All patients were premedicated with diazepam 0.15 mg/kg orally in the evening and on the morning before surgery. Induction of anaesthesia was started with a remifentanil infusion at 0.4 microgram/kg/min; 5 min later propofol was given for hypnosis using a target-controlled infusion initially started at 3.5 micrograms/ml. After loss of consciousness patients received 1.2 mg/kg of suxamethonium. Immediately after intubation, remifentanil was reduced to 0.2 microgram/kg/min, and the depth of anaesthesia was adjusted according to clinical needs by regulating the propofol target-controlled-infusion. BIS values and Narcotrend stages were recorded as data pairs in intervals of 1 min during anaesthetic induction and emergence, and in intervals of 5 min during maintenance of anaesthesia.
Fifty patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery were studied and 2031 data pairs were obtained. An increasing depth of anaesthesia as indicated by the Narcotrend was associated with significantly lower mean BIS values. With BIS values between 100 and 85 (representing awake patients), 95.5% of all data pairs indicated a Narcotrend stage A or B. In case the BIS was found to be 65-40 (representing general anaesthesia) the corresponding Narcotrend stages were measured as D (52.4%) or E (41.1%). No patient complained of intraoperative recall when interviewed on the 1st and 3rd postoperative day.
We could demonstrate that an increase of the hypnotic component of anaesthesia as indicated by BIS is accompanied by corresponding effects as displayed by the Narcotrend during propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia.

The primary objective of this study was to develop a method, using dynamic negative airway pressure (DNAP), for replicating UAO during deep sedation.
A state of deep sedation (defined as an Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score of 3 and a bispectral index < 80) was attained in 10 healthy volunteers, aged 19-41, using midazolam. Volunteers breathed through a chamber connected to a regulated source of negative pressure that was gradually adjusted downward to produce UAO based on maximal inspiratory flow. The study consisted of three phases: A control phase while awake, a study phase during midazolam deep sedation, and a recovery phase after flumazenil administration.
During the control phase no subject demonstrated airway obstruction at negative pressures to -30-cm H2O. All subjects exhibited complete UAO during DNAP episodes while sedated. Negative pressures required to cause complete UAO (Pcrit) ranged from -2 to -14 cm H2O. After administration of flumazenil, all subjects attained full consciousness within 5 min and did not demonstrate UAO at negative pressures to -30-cm H2O.
Dynamic Negative Airway Pressure is a useful method for provoking midazolam-induced UAO, and may potentially be used to compare the potential for different sedatives and patient factors to cause UAO. Flumazenil was completely effective in reversing the potential for midazolam to cause UAO.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11818766/
11812701,Electrocardiographic electrodes provide the same results as expensive special sensors in the routine monitoring of anesthetic depth.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2002,"Hemmerling TM, Harvey P","The Bispectral Index (BIS) is a mathematically derived electroencephalographic (EEG) derivative that has been introduced to monitor depth of anesthesia (1,2). The A-2000 BIS monitoring system (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Newton, MA) is currently the only commercially available system to monitor depth of anesthesia. In several studies, its propensity to optimize the use of hypnotics to maintain and achieve a certain depth of anesthesia has been described (3,4). Some studies have even proposed that the routine use of the monitoring system can decrease awareness (1,5), an increasing factor in malpractice claims. The cost-benefit calculations for BIS monitoring suffer from the fact that like its predecessor, the 1000-A BIS monitor, the A-2000 BIS monitoring system demands the use of expensive, special electrodes (6). Although the application of the single-use BIS sensor is very comfortable and easy to use, its high price of approximately $10-20 US prevents many anesthesiologists from using it. Furthermore, whereas the former model of the monitor (1000-A BIS monitor; Aspect Medical Systems, Inc.) used standardized connectors, which allowed the use of other electrodes such as electrocardiogram (ECG), the new monitoring system makes this very difficult because of special connectors that match the equivalent connector at the proximal BIS sensor site. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare BIS values derived from the original BIS sensor with BIS values derived from commercially available ECG electrodes. This comparison was made possible by designing and manufacturing a connector allowing the use of ECG electrodes.
The Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor adequately monitors depth of anesthesia. The routine use of this monitor has been hampered by the benefit-cost equation because only special expensive electrodes can be used. We examined the agreement of BIS values obtained by original sensor electrodes and commercial electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes.

This study investigates whether a BIS baseline between 50 and 60 prevents awareness reaction to endotracheal intubation. After approval by the university's Ethics Committee, 20 consenting patients were enrolled in the study. Midazolam (0.1 mg/kg PO) was given 30 minutes before induction. Anesthesia was induced with alfentanil (10 mcg/kg, followed by 2 mcg/kg(-1) x min(-1)) and propofol infusion was adjusted to a BIS target level between 50 and 60. Propofol infusion rate was maintained constant for 5 minutes with constant BIS. Prior to intubation, patients were tested in one-minute intervals for awareness using Tunstall's isolated forearm technique. Three minutes after endotracheal intubation, the study period ended and surgery was performed. After intubation, 8 of 20 patients showed an awareness reaction, squeezing the investigator's hand in response to a command. No patient had recall. Comparison of patients with and without awareness reaction revealed no differences in BIS before or after intubation. This study shows that a BIS value between 50 and 60 prior to intubation is inadequate to prevent an awareness reaction to endotracheal intubation during propofol/alfentanil anesthesia. Because BIS cannot differentiate between patients with and without awareness reaction, its value as a monitor for awareness and a measurement of the hypnotic component of anesthesia must be questioned.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11773816/

Computerized polysomnograph signals were analyzed manually according to standard criteria, classifying each 30-s epoch as a specific sleep stage. The BIS and SEF values were taken at the end of each period of sleep when the same stage had lasted for at least 2 min. Before sleep, median values for BIS were 97 +/- 12.1 and for SEF 23 +/- 4.2 Hz. After sleep initiation, the median BIS values for arousal, light, slow wave, and rapid eye movement sleep were 67 +/- 20.2, 50 +/- 16.5, 42 +/- 11.2, and 48 +/- 7.1, respectively, and the median SEF values were 20 +/- 4.7, 15 +/- 3.6, 10 +/- 2.6, and 19 +/- 4.1 Hz, respectively. Although both BIS and SEF decreased with increasing sleep depth, the distribution of values at each sleep depth was considerable, with overlap between each sleep stage. Neither BIS nor SEF reliably indicated conventionally determined sleep stages. In addition, the response of the BIS was slow and patients could arouse with low BIS values, which then took some time to increase.

Fifty ASA I and II patients 10-18 yr of age were enrolled in a prospective double-blinded study. Patients were randomized to receive either 20 mg of midazolam (M group) or midazolam vehicle (P group) as premedication. Before the induction, sedation scores and BIS values were determined in all patients. After inhaled induction and intubation, expired sevoflurane was stabilized at 3% in 60% N(2)O and the corresponding BIS (BIS I) recorded. Upon completion of surgery, sevoflurane was stabilized at 0.5% and the BIS (BIS E) again recorded. Plasma midazolam levels were measured at the time of BIS I and BIS E. There were no significant differences between groups in awakening time, sevoflurane/N(2)O awakening concentrations, time to postanesthesia care unit discharge, or BIS I and BIS E measurements. Sedation scores and preinduction BIS values were significantly lower in Group M than in Group P, although only 40% of midazolam-treated patients exhibited detectable sedation, with marked interindividual variability in achieved plasma midazolam levels. Detectable preoperative sedation was predictive of delayed emergence.
We demonstrated a measurable sedative effect of oral midazolam in adolescents which correlated with simultaneous bispectral index (BIS) measurement. Considering the overall group, midazolam premedication did not affect intraoperative BIS, emergence times, or recovery times compared with placebo controls. Detectable preoperative sedation, and not merely midazolam administration, was predictive of prolonged emergence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11772796/
11771598,Propofol anaesthesia via target controlled infusion or manually controlled infusion: effects on the bispectral index as a measure of anaesthetic depth.,Anaesthesia and intensive care,2001,"Gale T, Leslie K, Kluger M","Target controlled infusions (TCI) of propofol allow anaesthetists to target constant blood concentrations and respond promptly to signs of inappropriate anaesthetic depth. Studies comparing propofol TCI with manually controlled infusion (MCI) reported similar control of anaesthesia, but did not use an objective measure of anaesthetic depth. We therefore tested whether the Bispectral Index (BIS), an electroencephalographic (EEG) variable, is more stable during propofol TCI or MCI. Forty patients received midazolam and fentanyl before induction and were randomized to TCI or MCI. Target propofol concentrations in the TCI group were 3 to 8 microg/ml. The MCI group received propofol bolus (approximately 2 mg/kg) and infusion (3 to 10 mg/kg/h). Neuromuscular blockade was achieved with rocuronium. Following endotracheal intubation, nitrous oxide (66%) in oxygen was delivered and propofol infusion and fentanyl boluses were titrated against clinical signs. Blood pressure, heart rate and EEG were recorded, although the anaesthetist was blind to BIS values. The ideal BIS for general anaesthesia was defined as 50. Performance error, absolute performance error, wobble and divergence of BIS, and maximum changes in blood pressure and heart rate were compared using two-sample t-tests or rank-sum tests where appropriate. There was no difference in absolute performance errors during maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol TCI or MCI (23 +/- 11% vs 23 +/- 9%; P=0.97). The two groups did not differ significantly in performance error, wobble, divergence on haemodynamic changes. We conclude that TCI and MCI result in similar depth of anaesthesia and haemodynamic stability when titrated against traditional clinical signs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11771598/

Both parecoxib and valdecoxib inhibit human cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) activity in vitro. Thus, a potential exists for in vivo interactions with other CYP2C9 substrates, including propofol. This investigation determined the influence of parecoxib on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bolus dose propofol in human volunteers.
This was a randomized, balanced crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical investigation. Twelve healthy 21- to 37-yr-old subjects were studied after providing institutional review board-approved written informed consent. Each subject received a 2-mg/kg intravenous propofol bolus 1 h after placebo (control) or 40 mg intravenous parecoxib on two occasions. Venous concentrations of propofol, parecoxib, and parecoxib metabolites were determined by mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental analysis. Pharmacodynamic measurements included clinical endpoints, cognitive function (memory, Digit-Symbol Substitution Tests), subjective self-assessment of recovery (Visual Analog Scale) performed at baseline, 15, 30, 60 min after propofol, and sedation depth measured by Bispectral Index.
Propofol plasma concentrations were similar between placebo- and parecoxib-treated subjects. No significant differences were found in pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution) or pharmacodynamic parameters (clinical endpoints [times to: loss of consciousness, apnea, return of response to voice], Bispectral Index scores, Digit-Symbol Substitution Test scores, memory, Visual Analog Scale scores, propofol EC(50)).

A closed-loop anesthesia system was built using BIS as the control variable, a proportional-integral-differential control algorithm, and a propofol target-controlled infusion system as the control actuator. Closed-loop performance was assessed in 10 adult patients.
Ten adult patients scheduled to undergo elective hip or knee surgery were enrolled. An epidural cannula was inserted, and 0.5% bupivacaine was used to provide anesthesia to T8 before general anesthesia was induced using the propofol target-controlled infusion system under manual control. After the start of surgery, when anesthesia was clinically adequate, automatic control of anesthesia was commenced using the BIS as the control variable. Adequacy of anesthesia during closed-loop control was assessed clinically and by calculating the median performance error, the median absolute performance error, and the mean offset of the control variable.
The median performance error and the median absolute performance error were 2.2 and 8.0%, respectively. Mean offset of the BIS from the set point was 0.9. Cardiovascular parameters were stable during closed-loop control. Operating conditions were adequate in all patients but one, who began moving after 45 min of stable anesthesia. No patients reported awareness or recall of intraoperative events. In three patients, there was oscillation of the measured BIS around the set point.
The system was able to provide clinically adequate anesthesia in 9 of 10 patients.

After IRB approval, 70 ASA physical status I-III consenting elderly patients (> or =65 yr old) undergoing total knee or hip replacement procedures were randomly assigned to one of two general anesthetic groups. Propofol and fentanyl were administered for induction of anesthesia, followed by either desflurane 2%-4% or sevoflurane 1%-1.5% with nitrous oxide 65% in oxygen. The desflurane (2.5 +/- 0.6 MAC. h) and sevoflurane (2.7 +/- 0.5 MAC. h) concentrations were adjusted to maintain comparable depths of hypnosis using the electroencephalogram bispectral index monitor. The Mini-Mental State (MMS) test was used to assess cognitive function preoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, and 24-h intervals. The use of desflurane was associated with a more rapid emergence from anesthesia (6.3 +/- 2.4 min versus 8.0 +/- 2.8 min) and a shorter length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit (213 +/- 66 min versus 241 +/- 87 min). However, there were no significant differences between the Desflurane and the Sevoflurane groups when the MMS scores were compared preoperatively, and postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h. Compared with the preoperative (baseline) MMS scores, the values were significantly decreased at 1 h postoperatively (27.8 +/- 1.7 versus 29.5 +/- 0.5 in the Desflurane group, and 27.4 +/- 1.7 versus 29.2 +/- 1.0 in the Sevoflurane group, respectively). However, the MMS scores returned to preoperative baseline levels within 6 h after surgery. At 1 h and 3 h after surgery, 51% and 11% (versus 57% and 9%) of patients in the Desflurane (versus Sevoflurane) Group experienced cognitive impairment. In conclusion, desflurane is associated with a faster early recovery than sevoflurane after general anesthesia in elderly patients.

Ideally, to guide anesthetic management, range of BIS scores at different sedation levels should not overlap, and BIS should be independent of drug used. This study assessed ability of BIS to predict sedation depth between sevoflurane, propofol, and midazolam. Quality of recovery was also compared.
Patients undergoing surgery with local or regional anesthesia and sedation were randomized to sevoflurane (n = 23), midazolam (n = 21), or propofol (n = 22). Sedation was titrated to Observers's Assessment of Alertness-Sedation score of 3 (responds slowly to voice). BIS and Observers's Assessment of Alertness-Sedation were measured every 5 min. BIS prediction probability (PK) was compared between drugs. Recovery was assessed by BIS and Digit Symbol Substitution and memory tests.
Bispectral Index of responders to voice was significantly different from nonresponders (86 +/- 10 vs. 74 +/- 14, mean +/- SD; P < 0.001) However, wide variability and overlap in BIS were observed (25th-75th percentile, responders vs. non-responders: 79-96 vs. 65-83). BIS of responders was different for sevoflurane versus propofol and midazolam. BIS was a better predictor of propofol sedation than sevoflurane or midazolam (PK = 0.87 +/- 0.11, 0.76 +/- 0.01, and 0.69 +/- 0.02, respectively; P < 0.05).

This study was designed to comparatively investigate the anesthetic requirements of two different ethnic groups: Caucasians and African blacks. Forty-five Caucasians from Italy and 45 African blacks from Senegal, who underwent general IV anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil, were comparatively evaluated for anesthetic depth and time lapsed before recovery. We used an electroencephalographic-derived index of depth of anesthesia, the bispectral index (BIS), and evaluation of clinical variables to assess the depth of anesthesia and the recovery trend. Mean BIS values from Caucasians after propofol discontinuation returned to baseline (92-100) in approximately 8 min, whereas in African blacks BIS values remained <80 for some 30 min. Time to eye opening was 10.6 +/- 4.8 min in Caucasians versus 16.9 +/- 8.8 min in African blacks (P < 0.001). Time to respond to loud verbal commands was 14.8 +/- 9.1 min in African blacks versus 9.1 +/- 4.2 min in Caucasians (P < 0.01). During anesthetic induction, the mean arterial pressure decreased by 20% in Caucasians and by only 10% in African blacks. We conclude that the recovery from general anesthesia with propofol was slower in African blacks compared with Caucasian patients.

Thirty unpremedicated patients were studied before the start of surgery while receiving propofol sedation on two separate occasions according to a randomized, crossover protocol design. After achieving a stable baseline BIS value of either 75 or 80 with a target-controlled infusion of propofol, an external sound source administered noise at 50, 80, 110, and 120 dB. The changes in the BIS value were recorded over a 1-min interval at each noise level. In the BIS 75 group, increasing levels of noise did not significantly alter the BIS value. However, in the BIS 80 group, the BIS values at 80, 110, and 120 dB were significantly higher compared to the value at 50 dB. In conclusion, experimental noise increases the BIS and appears to have a greater effect on the BIS value at ""lighter"" levels of propofol sedation.

Prospective, observational study.
Medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university-affiliated teaching hospital.
Thirty-one awake, unsedated critically ill adults were assessed in 108 separate sessions.
In each session, severity of illness was assessed by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE III). The APACHE III Acute Physiology Score was used to quantify the degree of physiologic derangement. Neurologic function was assessed using the APACHE III Neurologic Score, the Glasgow Coma Scale, the Reaction Level Scale, and the Modified Ramsay Sedation Scale. All indices were plotted against various spectral parameters of the EEG, including BIS, an empirical index of EEG activity that is scaled from 0 to 100. BIS was significantly (p <.05) correlated with neurologic score regardless of scoring system used and was more strongly correlated than any other EEG spectral parameter. Better neurologic function was associated with higher values of BIS. In multivariate analysis, the combination of BIS and relative power in the theta band of the EEG accounted for 38% of the variability in the Glasgow Coma Scale.
BIS provides a reliable index of neurologic status in awake, unsedated, critically ill patients. Further research is needed to determine whether the effects of neurologic status and pharmacologic sedation upon EEG are additive, whether BIS can be used to assess pharmacologic sedation in the critically ill patient population, and whether such objective measures of neurologic status have prognostic value.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11588470/

The current study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of AEPindex for predicting depth of sedation and anesthesia during sevoflurane anesthesia.
In the first phase of the study, a single end-tidal sevoflurane concentration ranging from 0.5 to 0.9% was assigned randomly and administered to each of 50 patients. The AEPindex and the Bispectral Index (BIS) were obtained simultaneously. Sedation was assessed using the responsiveness portion of the observer's assessment of alertness-sedation scale. In the second phase of the study, 10 additional patients were included, and the 60 patients who were scheduled to have skin incisions were observed for movement in response to skin incision at the end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations between 1.6 and 2.6%. The relation among AEPindex, BIS, sevoflurane concentration, sedation score, and movement or absence of movement after skin incision was determined. Prediction probability values for AEPindex, BIS, and sevoflurane concentration to predict depth of sedation and anesthesia were also calculated.

An anaesthetic depth monitor must discriminate in real time between wakefulness and unconsciousness. The present study created a period of wakefulness during propofol-induced hypnosis. Bispectral index (BIS), explicit and implicit memories of the awake period were investigated.
Ten volunteers were studied. The calculated brain concentration of a target controlled infusion of propofol was increased until loss of response (LOR) to verbal command and then propofol was stopped. When fully awake, volunteers were presented with a picture, sound and smell. Propofol infusion was restarted until LOR and then ceased. BIS and the calculated brain concentration of propofol were recorded every minute. A structured interview was conducted for explicit memories after awakening and for explicit as well as implicit memories the day after.
Median BIS-index for the transition between awake and asleep and vice versa differed significantly. It was not possible, however, to establish any threshold value or zone for discriminating between wakefulness and LOR due to the large inter-individual variations in BIS-index. No volunteer could explicitly recall any of the stimuli presented during the period of wakefulness.
The BIS-index decreases with increasing sedation but because of the large individual variations, the real-time BIS-index for the individual subject cannot reliably discriminate wakefulness from unconsciousness during propofol infusion.

Twenty female patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, who were scheduled for gynecologic laparotomy were included to receive propofolremifentanil anesthesia. In group I, propofol was titrated using a BIS-guided, model-based, closed-loop system. The BIS target was set at 50. In group II, propofol was titrated using classical hemodynamic signs of (in)adequate anesthesia. Performance of control during induction and maintenance of anesthesia were compared between both groups using BIS as the controlled variable in group I and the reference variable in group II, and, conversely, the systolic blood pressure as the controlled variable in group II and the reference variable in group I. At the end of anesthesia, recovery profiles between groups were compared.
Although patients undergoing manual induction of anesthesia in group II at 300 ml/h reached a BIS level of 50 faster than patients undergoing open-loop, computer-controlled induction in group I, manual induction caused a more pronounced initial overshoot of the BIS target. This resulted in a more pronounced decrease in blood pressure in group II. During the maintenance phase, better control of BIS and systolic blood pressure was found in group I compared with group II. Recovery was faster in group I.
A closed-loop system for propofol administration using the BIS as a controlled variable together with a model-based controller is clinically acceptable during general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11465585/

Previous studies have shown conflicting results. To eliminate bias, a control group of 75 cases anaesthetized by the authors was compared to a reference group of 141 cases anaesthetized by other anaesthetists. A study group of 71 cases was then anaesthetized by the authors titrating to BIS 40-50 and this was compared with the control group. Recovery characteristics were assessed using a Modified Aldrete score. BIS monitored cases had improvements in blood pressure stability (P = 0.023) and respiratory score (P = 0.016) throughout the study period. Activity and consciousness levels were higher on arrival in PACU in the BIS monitored group (P = 0.015 and P = 0.017) but were not maintained. There was no significant difference in mean oxygen saturation scores. The improved recovery characteristics in BIS monitored patients may have positive implications for safety, nursing workload, staffing, and cost savings in the PACU.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11439793/

100 patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring CPB.
A constant effect site concentration of 2.2 ng/mL for fentanyl and 60 ng/mL for midazolam was maintained throughout surgery using a computer-assisted continuous infusion technique.
The BIS value, percent isoflurane administered, predicted brain concentrations of midazolam and fentanyl, and nasopharyngeal temperature were recorded before CPB, at 15 minutes after the onset of CPB, at placement of the aortic cross-clamp, at start of rewarming, on separation from CPB, and 15 minutes after the end of CPB. Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures mixed-effects method, taking into account temperature, age, and predicted level of each anesthetic.
A significant overall association between temperature and BIS was observed independent of patient age, predicted brain midazolam or fentanyl concentration, percent isoflurane administered, and surgical time point (p < 0.001).

Prospective study comparing blinded evaluations of the SAS, VAS and BIS.
Forty-two-bed multidisciplinary ICU.
Convenience sample of 39 adults after cardiac surgery.
Bispectral Index 3.2 was continuously recorded using the Aspect A-1000 and evaluators were blinded to this value. The bedside nurse and a trained researcher independently rated wakefulness using a 100 mm VAS upon patient arrival on the ICU, at first awakening, when ventilator weaning was started and after extubation; the researcher also evaluated patients using SAS. Upon arrival on the ICU, the median SAS score was 2 (interquartile range = 1-3), the mean VAS was 26+/-30 and the mean BIS was 70+/-16. Twenty-four patients underwent a trial of weaning from mechanical ventilation with a SAS of 4 (IQR = 4), VAS of 86+/-12 and BIS of 87+/-10. SAS correlated well with VAS performed by one researcher (r = 0.91, p < 0.001) or by 19 different bedside nurses (r = 0.43, p < 0.001) and with BIS 3.2 (r = 0.60, p < 0.001). The correlation between SAS and BIS was reduced in patients with above average electromyogram (EMG) power. As a measure of construct validity, significant differences were noted for the BIS, SAS, VAS and EMG between ICU arrival and extubation (all p < 0.001).

11407290,Effects on the bispectral index during elective caesarean section: a comparison of propofol and isoflurane.,Acta anaesthesiologica Sinica,2001,"Tsai PS, Huang CJ, Hung YC, Cheng CR","Awareness during general anesthesia has been a particular problem during caesarean section. About 7 percent of patients undergoing elective caesarean section have reported dreaming or recall of voices during the procedure. The bispectral index (BIS), a value derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG), has been shown to be useful in monitoring the depth of anesthesia. Supplementation of propofol or isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia has been shown to effectively reduce the incidence of awareness. However, the effects of propofol or isoflurane on the BIS index have not been fully investigated. We therefore designed this study to compare the effects of isoflurane or propofol supplementation on the BIS index in 24 healthy parturients undergoing elective caesarean section.
All patients had induction of anesthesia and orotracheal intubation in rapid sequence made possible by 1 MAC isoflurane with 50% N2O-50% O2 as conveyer and atracurium. After delivery, patients were randomly assigned to either of two groups (isoflurane or propofol). Patients in the Isoflurane group (n = 12) received 0.5 MAC isoflurane in 67% N2O-33% O2 and fentanyl + droperidol. Patients in the propofol group (n = 12) received propofol (8 mg/kg/h) infusion combined with 67% N2O-33% O2 and fentanyl + droperidol.
There was no difference between the two groups in total operation time, maternal blood loss, fetal Apgar scores. No differences between the two groups in heart rate, blood pressure or BIS index values were found throughout the surgery. No patient from either group reported recall of the operative procedure. However, 25% of patients (3 of 12) in the isoflurane group had poor uterine contraction, suggestive of doubtful appropriateness of the use of isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia in delivery.
We therefore concluded that supplementation of isoflurane or propofol for maintenance of anesthesia can satisfactorily decrease the BIS index and minimize the incidence of awareness in patients undergoing caesarean section under general anesthesia. The BIS index is a reliable monitor of the hypnotic component of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11407290/
11381378,Assessment of recovery in patients undergoing intravenous conscious sedation using bispectral analysis.,Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,2001,"Sandler NA, Hodges J, Sabino M","The Bispectral Index (BIS) has been recently shown to objectively predict the level of sedation in patients undergoing conscious sedation. It was the goal of this study to directly compare the recovery profile of patients where the BIS was used to monitor sedation with a control group where the monitor was not used.
Forty patients undergoing third molar extractions under intravenous conscious sedation were randomly assigned to 2 groups. In both groups, induction of sedation was performed using a standard dose of fentanyl (1.5 microg/kg) and midazolam (0.05 mg/kg). Propofol was then given in 10 to 20 mg boluses until a clinically desirable sedation level was achieved. In 1 group, the BIS was then monitored continually during surgery using a microcomputer (Aspect-1050 Monitor, Aspect Co, Natick, MA) and recorded at 5-minute intervals. The anesthetist (N.A.S.) provided additional propofol boluses to maintain a BIS level of 70 to 80. In the other group, the BIS sensor was applied, but the monitor was not used. In this group, the sedation was modified, and additional propofol was given based solely on the anesthetist's subjective assessment of the desired level of sedation (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation [OAA/S] scale level 2 to 3). Additional boluses of 1 mg of midazolam were given during the procedure if patients required repeated boluses of propofol at less than 5-minute intervals to maintain the desired sedation level (BIS level of 70 to 80 or OAA/S level of 2 to 3). These additional midazolam boluses, as well as the time of the last sedative dose (propofol or midazolam) were recorded to study the effect of these factors on recovery.
Of the 40 patients initially included in the study, 1 subject in the BIS-monitored group was excluded due to the loss of intravenous access at initiation of the case. For the remaining 39 subjects, 19 were assessed objectively using the BIS monitor, whereas 20 were assessed subjectively using the OAA/S scale. The BIS cases were slightly longer in duration than the OAA/S cases, lasting an average of 26 minutes versus 22 minutes. This difference was statistically nonsignificant (P =.19). Less propofol was used in the BIS cases, with an average of 98 mg for BIS cases versus 106 mg for OAA/S cases (P =.59). The total dose in mg/kg/min was significantly less in the BIS group (0.054 mg/kg/min) than in the OAA/S group (0.074 mg/kg/min; P =.0082). There was no significant difference in the amount of midazolam administered after induction between the 2 groups (P =.60). The surgeon, who was blinded to whether the monitor was used, ranked the third molar extractions more difficult in the BIS group (P =.05). However, patients in the BIS group were on average more cooperative, with better maintenance of muscle tone. The difference in these parameters were nonsignificant (P =.15 and .092, respectively). A positive Romberg test was obtained earlier in BIS patients, although this difference was nonsignificant (P =.097). The straight-line test was completed significantly sooner in BIS patients (P =.013). There was no significant difference between the BIS and OAA/S groups in perceptual speed (P =.55) or computation (P =.32). There was essentially no difference between groups in patient-assessed comfort or recall of the procedure. There were also no notable differences in anesthesia complications, return to activities of daily life, or pain medication use between the 2 groups.
The BIS provides additional information for standard monitoring techniques that helps guide the administration of sedative-hypnotic agents. It appears that use of the BIS monitor can help to titrate the level of sedation so that less drugs are used to maintain the desired level. The trend toward an earlier return of motor function in BIS-monitored patients warrants further investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11381378/
11388531,Epidural lidocaine decreases sevoflurane requirement for adequate depth of anesthesia as measured by the Bispectral Index monitor.,Anesthesiology,2001,"Hodgson PS, Liu SS","Epidural anesthesia potentiates sedative drug effects and decreases minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). The authors hypothesized that epidural anesthesia also decreases the general anesthetic requirements for adequate depth of anesthesia as measured by Bispectral Index (BIS).
After premedication with 0.02 mg/kg midazolam and 1 microg/kg fentanyl, 30 patients aged 20-65 yr were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive general anesthesia with either intravenous saline placebo or intravenous lidocaine control (1-mg/kg bolus dose; 25 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)). A matched group was prospectively assigned to receive epidural lidocaine (15 ml; 2%) with intravenous saline placebo. All patients received 4 mg/kg thiopental and 1 mg/kg rocuronium for tracheal intubation. After 10 min of a predetermined end-tidal sevoflurane concentration, BIS was measured. The ED50 of sevoflurane for each group was determined by up-down methodology based on BIS less than 50 (MAC(BIS50)). Plasma lidocaine concentrations were measured.
The MAC(BIS50) of sevoflurane (0.59% end tidal) was significantly decreased with lidocaine epidural anesthesia compared with general anesthesia alone (0.92%) or with intravenous lidocaine (1%; P < 0.0001). Plasma lidocaine concentrations in the intravenous lidocaine group (1.9 microg/ml) were similar to those in the epidural lidocaine group (2.0 microg/ml).
Epidural anesthesia reduced by 34% the sevoflurane required for adequate depth of anesthesia. This effect was not a result of systemic lidocaine absorbtion, but may have been caused by deafferentation by epidural anesthesia or direct rostral spread of local anesthetic within the cerebrospinal fluid. Lower-than-expected concentrations of volatile agents may be sufficient during combined epidural-general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11388531/

Transformed electroencephalogram monitors, such as the Bispectral Index monitor, have been advocated as tools to prevent unexpected recall.
The authors conducted a power analysis to estimate how many patients would be needed in an appropriately powered study to demonstrate the Bispectral Index monitor reduces awareness, as well as a cost analysis to assess the cost of using the monitor for this purpose alone.
If unexpected recall is rare (1 in 20,000), it will require a large study to demonstrate that the monitor reduces awareness (200,000-800,000 patients), and the cost of using it for this purpose alone would be high ($400,000 per case prevented). If awareness is common (1 in 100), then the number of patients needed in a study to demonstrate that the monitor works becomes tractable (1,000-4,000 patients), and the cost of using the monitor for this purpose alone becomes lower ($2,000 per case prevented). Because there are reported cases of awareness despite Bispectral Index monitoring, the authors are certain that the effectiveness of the monitor is less than 100%. As the performance of the monitor decreases from 100%, the size of the study needed to demonstrate that it works increases, as does the cost of using it to prevent awareness.
The contention that Bispectral Index monitoring reduces the risk of awareness is unproven, and the cost of using it for this indication is currently unknown.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11374615/

Electroencephalogram bispectral index (BIS) enables monitoring of the hypnotic state and titration of anesthesia to an adequate level (BIS 40 to 60). At this level, preserved memory function has been observed in trauma patients. We investigated memory formation in elective surgical outpatients during target-controlled propofol anesthesia supplemented with alfentanil. While BIS remained between 40 and 60, patients listened to a tape with either familiar instances (exemplars) from two categories (Experimental [E] group, n = 41) or bird sounds (Control [C] group, n = 41). After recovery, memory was tested directly and indirectly. BIS during audio presentation was on average (+/- SD) 44 +/- 5 and 46 +/- 5 for Groups E and C, respectively. No patient consciously recalled the intraoperative period, nor were presented words recognized reliably (Group E, 0.9 +/- 0.8 hits; Group C, 0.8 +/- 0.8 hits) (P = 0.7). When asked to generate category exemplars, Group E named 2.10 +/- 1.0 hits versus 1.98 +/- 1.0 in Group C (P = 0.9). We found no explicit or implicit memory effect of familiar words presented during adequate propofol anesthesia at BIS levels between 40 and 60 in elective surgical patients.
This study suggests that stable levels of adequate hypnosis may prevent information processing and memory formation during general anesthesia and supports the feasibility of electroencephalogram bispectral index as a monitor of adequate anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11323348/

However, peritoneal stimulations including open surgery cause both a systemic vasopressor response and a vasopressin release, which are suppressed by opiate administration. Also, a decreased venous return of blood to the heart causes vasopressin release. Furthermore, previous haemodynamic assessments of laparoscopic surgery have been conducted using various anaesthetic regimens, which are likely to have caused various haemodynamic effects. We hypothesised that intraoperative haemodynamic and/or humoral changes would not be observed in association with laparoscopic surgery provided that, (a) normovolaemia is continuously maintained using transoesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) assessment, and (b) adequate depth of general anaesthesia is continuously maintained by bispectral index (BIS) monitoring and high plasma Ievel opiate administration.
Twenty ASA 1 women undergoing laparoscopic surgery received 10 ml. kg-1 lactated Ringer's solution and thereafter were randomly allocated to receive intraoperatively either 8 ng. ml-1 or 4 ng. ml-1 plasma remifentanil concentrations while BIS was maintained at 50+/-5 by isoflurane alteration. The group receiving 4 ng. ml-1 remifentanil was used as control. Expired CO2 was maintained within a 32-38 kPa range throughout the investigation. Complete TEE haemodynamic investigation was performed before pneumoperitoneum (PP) (T1), and during PP horizontal (T2), with a head-up tilt (T3), with a head-down tilt (T4), horizontal (T5), and PP released (T6). Plasma vasopressin, epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were measured at T1, T3, and T6. ANOVA, Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used for statistical analysis.
Haemodynamic indices and humoral values did not change significantly within and between remifentanil groups throughout the investigation (all P<0.05).
Continuous adequate depth of anaesthesia and normovolaemia may have prevented both a humoral and a haemodynamic response, initiated in the peritoneum by the contact with CO2 in previous investigations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11308999/

This prospective, randomized observer-blinded study was designed to evaluate the effect of BIS monitoring on anesthetic use and recovery characteristics in pediatric patients. After data collection in 38 historical controls, 202 patients age 0-18 yr were randomized into one of two groups: standard practice (SP) and BIS guided (BIS). Patients age 0-3 yr undergoing inguinal hernia repair (IH) and patients age 3-18 yr undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (TA) were selected. All patients were anesthetized with sevoflurane in 60% N(2)O/O(2). Hernia patients also received a caudal epidural anesthetic before surgery.

BIS was recorded throughout surgery in all patients, but data were unavailable to the anesthesiologist in the SP group. In the TA patients, BIS monitoring was associated with a significant reduction in end-tidal sevoflurane concentration during maintenance (2.4 +/- 0.6%, SP and 1.8 +/- 0.4% BIS, mean +/- SD) and during the last 15 min of the procedure (2.1 +/- 0.7, SP and 1.6 +/- 0.6, BIS).

Fentanyl, inexpensive and easy to administer, is the most common opioid used for this purpose. As an adjuvant to general anesthesia for outpatient gynecologic surgery, we questioned if remifentanil was cost-effective as an alternative to fentanyl. Thirty-four patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy or hysteroscopy were prospectively and randomly assigned to a standard practice (n = 18) or a study (n = 16) group.

In Experiment 1, propofol was infused in 11 subjects to obtain effect-site concentrations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 microg/mL. The ASSR and BIS index were recorded during baseline and at each concentration. The ASSR was evoked by monaural stimuli. Propofol caused a concentration-dependent decrease of the ASSR and BIS index values (r(2) = 0.76 and 0.93, respectively; P<0.0001). The prediction probability for loss of consciousness was 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 for ASSR, BIS, and arterial blood concentration of propofol, respectively. In Experiment 2, we compared the effects of binaural versus monaural stimulus delivery on the ASSR in six subjects during awake baseline and propofol-induced unconsciousness. During baseline, the ASSR amplitude with binaural stimulation (0.47+/-0.13 microV, mean +/- SD) was significantly (P<0.002) larger than with monaural stimulation (0.35+/-0.11 microV). During unconsciousness, the amplitude was 0.09+/-0.09 microV with monaural and 0.06+/-0.04 microV with binaural stimulation (NS). The prediction probability for loss of consciousness was 0.97 (0.04 SE) for monaural and 1.00 (0.00 SE) for binaural delivery. We conclude that the ASSR and BIS index are attenuated in a concentration-dependent manner by propofol and provide a useful measure of its sedative and hypnotic effect. BIS was easier to use and slightly more sensitive. The ASSR should be recorded with binaural stimulation. The ASSR and BIS index are both useful for assessing the level of consciousness during sedation and hypnosis with propofol. However, the BIS index was simpler to use and provided a more sensitive measure of sedation.
We have compared two methods for predicting whether the amount of propofol given to a human subject is sufficient to cause unconsciousness, defined as failure to respond to a simple verbal command. The two methods studied are the auditory steady-state response, which measures the electrical response of the brain to sound, and the bispectral index, which is a number derived from the electroencephalogram. The results showed that both methods are very good predictors of the level of consciousness; however, bispectral was easier to use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11093988/

Patient assessments included pain on injection, induction time, hemodynamic and bispectral electroencephalographic changes during induction, emergence time, and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. The two propofol groups were comparable demographically, and the induction times and bispectral index values during the induction were also similar. However, the bisulfite-containing formulation was associated with less severe pain on injection (5% vs 11%), with fewer patients recalling pain on injection after surgery (38% vs. 51%, P<0.05). None of the patients manifested allergic-type reactions after the induction of anesthesia. The acquisition cost (average wholesale price in US dollars) of a 20-mL ampoule of Diprivan(TM) was $15 compared with $13 for the bisulfite-containing propofol formulation. Therefore, we concluded that the bisulfite-containing formulation of propofol is a cost-effective alternative to Diprivan(TM) for the induction of outpatient anesthesia.
Bisulfite-containing propofol and Diprivan(TM) (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE) were similar with respect to their induction characteristics; however, the generic formulation was associated with a smaller incidence of injection pain. Assuming that the drug costs are similar, these data suggest that the bisulfite-containing formulation of propofol is a cost-effective alternative to Diprivan(TM).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11004040/

Forty-eight patients (ASA physical status I-III) were randomized to receive either propofol-nitrous oxide general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway with anesthetic depth titrated to a bispectral index level of 40-60, 15-20 mL of 3% 2-chloroprocaine epidural, or 75 mg of subarachnoid procaine with 20 microg fentanyl. All patients were premedicated with <0.035 mg/kg midazolam and <1 microg/kg fentanyl and received intraarticular bupivacaine and 15-30 mg of IV ketorolac during the procedure. Recovery times, operating room turnover times, and patient satisfaction were recorded by an observer using an objective scale for recovery assessment and a verbal rating scale for satisfaction. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance and chi(2). Postanesthesia care unit discharge times for the general and epidural groups were similar (general = 104+/-31 min, epidural = 92+/-18 min), whereas the spinal group had a longer recovery time (146+/-52 min) (P = 0.0003). Patient satisfaction was equally good in all three groups (P = 0.34). Room turnover times did not differ among groups (P = 0.16). There were no anesthetic failures or serious adverse events in any group. Pruritus was more frequent in the spinal group (7 of 16 required treatment) than in the general or epidural groups (no pruritus) (P<0.001). We conclude that epidural anesthesia with 2-chloroprocaine provides comparable recovery and discharge times to general anesthesia provided with propofol and nitrous oxide. Spinal anesthesia with procaine and fentanyl is an effective alternative and is associated with a longer discharge time and increased side effects.
For outpatient knee arthroscopy, anesthesia can be provided adequately with regional or general anesthesia. Epidural and general anesthesia provide equal recovery times and patient satisfaction, whereas spinal anesthesia may prolong recovery and have increased side effects. The choice of anesthesia may depend primarily on the patient's interest in being alert or asleep during the procedure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11004038/

Clonidine premedication has been reported to control blood pressure intra- and postoperatively, as well as to reduce the requirements for hypnotic agents. The bispectral index (BIS) monitor is a reproducible, objective, observer independent, quantitative measurement of the hypnotic state.
This study was designed to compare the propofol consumption rate during BIS monitored propofol-ketamine anesthesia for office-based, elective female facial rhytidectomy in patients with and without clonidine premedication.
Six patients receiving clonidine (200 microg oral premedication administered 30-60 minutes prior to induction of anesthesia were compared with a recent, historical control group of six patients who received no premedication. A BIS of 60-70 was chosen as the standard of comparison for light hypnotic state. A dilute propofol solution was used to gradually titrate anesthesia to a BIS of 60-70 prior to the administration of ketamine.
A statistically significant reduction in propofol consumption was observed in the clonidine premedicated female elective rhytidectomy patients compared with those not receiving the clonidine. Other than modestly increased requirements for IV fluids, there were no adverse effects observed with clonidine premedication.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10971558/

The mechanism behind this phenomenon is speculated to be decreased afferent stimulation of the reticular activating system. The authors performed a two-part study (nonrandomized pilot study and a subsequent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study) using the Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor to quantify the degree of sedation in unmedicated volunteers undergoing spinal anesthesia.
Twelve volunteers underwent BIS monitoring and observer sedation scoring (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale [OAA/S]) before and after spinal anesthesia with 50 mg hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%. Subsequently, 16 volunteers blinded to the study were randomized to receive spinal anesthesia with 50 mg hyperbaric lidocaine, 5% (n = 10) or placebo (n = 6) and underwent BIS and OAA/S monitoring.
In part I, significant changes in BIS scores of the volunteers occurred progressively (P = 0.003). The greatest variations from baseline BIS measurement occurred at 30 and 70 min. In part II, there were significant decreases in OAA/S and self-sedation scores for patients receiving spinal anesthesia versuscontrol patients (P = 0.04 and 0. 01, respectively). The greatest decrease in OAA/S scores occurred at 60 min. BIS scores were similar between groups (P = 0.4).
Spinal anesthesia is accompanied by significant sedation progressively when compared with controls as measured by OAA/S and self-sedation scores. This effect was not related to block height. The late sedation observed by OAA/S at 60 min may indicate a second mechanism of sedation, such as delayed rostral spread of local anesthetics. BIS was not a sensitive measure of the sedation associated with spinal anesthesia in the randomized, blinded portion of this study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10969306/

A review of the published data was performed by the authors in order to assess the suitability of BIS technology application to the geriatric population.
Age-related EEG differences exist in the normal population but they do not affect the BIS. The BIS correlates with depth of sedation independently of age. Senile dementia may be associated with significantly lower BIS values.

No differences were detected within groups in sedation scores before and after intervention, or between groups at either stage. No between-group differences were detected in electroencephalographic variables. In the spinal group, spinal anaesthesia caused an increase in bispectral index, 95% spectral edge frequency, median frequency and beta frequencies, and a decrease in delta frequencies and mean arterial pressure.

However, bispectral index monitoring is currently used to objectively measure sedation levels in several clinical settings. This study compares the temporal relationship of bispectral index levels versus the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale for sedation during endoscopy and proposes a functional bispectral index range for endoscopic procedures.
Fifty consecutive adults undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, colonoscopy, or esophagogastroduodenoscopy by a single endoscopist were studied. Intravenous sedation was achieved with diazepam and meperidine. Bispectral index levels (0 to 100) and OAA/S scores (1 to 5) were recorded every 3 minutes by a single trained observer.
There were significant temporal correlations between bispectral index levels and OAA/S scores (r = 0.59, p < 0.0001). Bispectral index levels and OAA/S scores corresponded with the need for additional sedation as determined clinically by the endoscopist. An OAA/S score of 3 corresponded to a bispectral index level of 81.49 +/- 9.78.
Bispectral index monitoring temporally correlates with the OAA/S scale and therefore provides an objective measure of sedation during endoscopy. This preliminary, observational study suggests that a bispectral index level near 82 corresponds with sufficient and functional sedation levels for endoscopy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10922090/

Thirty ASA physical status I or II patients were randomly allocated to receive either 50% air in oxygen (control group) or 60%-70% N(2)O in oxygen (N(2)O group) that was commenced via a mask simultaneously with the induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was performed in all the patients with IV propofol at the target effect compartment site concentration of 4 microg/mL throughout the study. A target-controlled infusion (TCI) of remifentanil was initiated 3 min after the TCI of propofol and maintained at the effect-site concentration of 4 ng/mL until the end of the study. After loss of consciousness, and before the administration of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg, a tourniquet was applied to one arm and inflated to a value more than the systolic blood pressure. An examiner, blinded to the presence of N(2)O, sought to detect any gross movement within the first minute after tracheal intubation, which was performed 10 min after remifentanil TCI began. Inspired and expired oxygen, N(2)O, and carbon dioxide were continuously monitored. A BIS value was generated every 10 s. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured noninvasively every minute. Measures of mean arterial pressure (MAP), HR, and BIS were obtained before the induction, before the start of the remifentanil TCI, before laryngoscopy, and 5 min after intubation. No significant intergroup differences were seen in BIS, HR, and MAP throughout the study. Maximum changes in BIS, HR, and MAP with intubation were significant (P < 0.01) for both groups but comparable. Six patients in the control group and none in the N(2)O group moved after intubation (P < 0.05).
We demonstrated that 0.6 minimal alveolar concentration of nitrous oxide combined with a potent anesthetic and an opioid prevents movement after orotracheal intubation without affecting the bispectral index. This demonstrates that the bispectral index is not a useful neurophysiologic variable to monitor the level of anesthesia when nitrous oxide is added to a general anesthetic regimen using propofol and remifentanil.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10866899/

The effect of their combination on the MLAEP was evaluated. Also, the bispectral index (BIS) was compared with the ability of MLAEP to correlate with sedation and predict loss of consciousness.
Twenty healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive stepped increases in propofol concentration (10 subjects) or propofol plus alfentanil 100 ng/ml (10 subjects). At baseline and at each targeted effect site concentration the mean MLAEP, BIS, measures of sedation, and drug concentration were obtained. The relation among MLAEP, BIS, and sedation score was determined. The prediction probability (Pk) was calculated and compared for BIS and MLAEP.
The BIS and MLAEP patterns showed significant changes (Pa and Nb decreased in amplitude and increased in latency) with increasing level of sedation (P < 0.0001). The BIS correlated better with sedation scores (0.884) than did the MLAEP (P < 0.05). Pa and Nb latencies showed the best correlation with sedation levels (0.685 and 0.658, respectively). The addition of alfentanil did not affect the relation between MLAEP and loss of consciousness (P > 0.15).

In addition, previous research has shown that implicit memory (e.g., improved memory test performance in absence of conscious recall) decreases with increasing hypnotic state. The current study investigated explicit and implicit memory during emergency cesarean sections with consistently light levels of hypnotic state.
Words were presented via headphones, and the bispectral index was recorded throughout surgery. Memory for the presented words was tested after recovery with a word-stem completion test. Using both parts of the process dissociation procedure allowed separation of explicit and implicit memory. In the ""inclusion"" part of the process dissociation procedure, patients are asked to complete word stems, if possible, with the corresponding words recalled from the intraoperative presentation. In the ""exclusion"" part, patients are instructed to avoid the words presented intraoperatively and to use other words instead. In the absence of recall, patients are asked to use the first word that comes to mind.
The mean bispectral index during word presentation was 76.3 (+/-3.0). On average, the 24 patients were able to make correct inclusion-exclusion decisions: In the inclusion part, hit rates (i.e., the probability of responding with a word presented during surgery) were higher than base rates (0.37 vs. 0.31), whereas in the exclusion part hit rates were lower (0.23 vs. 0.28). Importantly, the patients made these inclusion-exclusion decisions without being able to consciously recall the words presented during surgery.
This study shows that if words are presented at relatively light levels of anesthesia, patients are able to control their inclusion-exclusion decisions. This weak form of explicit memory can occur in the absence of conscious recall.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10754622/

We investigated whether BIS reflects clinical markers of hypnosis and demonstrates agent dose-responsiveness in infants and children. In an observational arm of this study, BIS values in children undergoing general anesthesia were observed and compared with similar data collected previously in a study of adults. In a second arm of the study, a range of steady-state end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane was administered and corresponding BIS documented. Data were examined for differences between infants (0-2 yr) and children (2-12 yr). No difference was seen in BIS values in children before induction, during maintenance, and on emergence compared with adult values. There was no difference in BIS between infants and children at similar clinical levels of anesthesia. In children and infants, BIS was inversely proportional to the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane. The sevoflurane concentration for a BIS = 50 (95% confidence interval) was significantly different: 1. 55% (1.40-1.70) for infants versus 1.25% (1.12-1.37) for children. Although validation with specific behavioral end points was not possible, BIS correlated with clinical indicators of anesthesia in children as it did in adults: as depth of anesthesia increased, BIS diminished. BIS correlated with sevoflurane concentration in infants and children. The concentration-response difference between infants and children was consistent with data showing that minimum alveolar concentration is higher in children less than 1 yr of age.
The use of bispectral index (BIS) during general anesthesia improves the titration of anesthetics in adults. The data from this study suggest that the same equipment and method of electroencephalogram analysis may be applied to infants and children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10735791/

The effects of age on the electroencephalographic response to inhalational anesthesia have not been well documented. The objective of the present study was to determine the influence of age on hypnotic requirement and electroencephalographic derivatives such as bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency associated with sedation induced by sevoflurane.
Ninety-six patients were randomly allocated into one of three age groups A, B, and C, ranging in age from 18-39 yr, 40-64 yr, and 65-85 yr, respectively. Patients in each group were sedated with sevoflurane at two predetermined concentrations ranging between 0.45% and 0.85%. The relationship between sevoflurane concentration and response to a verbal command, as well as the relationships between response and bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency, was determined.
Multiple regression analysis showed that end-tidal sevoflurane concentration and age significantly affected both bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency. ED50 values of sevoflurane concentration for loss of consciousness, defined as no response to verbal command, were different between groups A and C: 0.72 (95% confidence interval: 0.68-0.75) versus 0.59 (95% confidence interval: 0.56-0.62). However, the same effective values of bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency at this same clinical end point did not differ.
Increasing age reduced sevoflurane requirements to suppress responses to a verbal command but did not change bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency associated with this end point, and in a population with a wide age range, bispectral index would predict depth of sedation better than end-tidal sevoflurane concentration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10638899/
10638898,Propofol for monitored anesthesia care: implications on hypoxic control of cardiorespiratory responses.,Anesthesiology,2000,"Nieuwenhuijs D, Sarton E, Teppema L, Dahan A","Hypoxia has a dual effect on ventilation: an initial period of hyperventilation, the acute hypoxic response, is followed after 3-5 min by a slow decline, the hypoxic ventilatory decline. Because of hypoxic ventilatory decline, subsequent acute hypoxic responses are depressed. In this study, the influence of a sedative concentration of propofol on ventilation was studied if hypoxia was sustained and intermittent.
Ten healthy young male volunteers performed two hypoxic tests without and with a target controlled infusion of propofol. The sustained hypoxic test consisted of 15 min of isocapnic hypoxia followed by 2 min of normoxia and 3 min of hypoxia. The test of hypoxic pulses involved six subsequent exposures to 3 min hypoxia followed by 2 min of normoxia. The bispectral index of the electroencephalogram was measured to obtain an objective measure of sedation.
Blood propofol concentrations varied among subjects but were stable over time (mean blood concentration 0.6 microg/ml). The sustained hypoxic test showed that propofol decreased acute hypoxic response by approximately 50% and that the magnitude of hypoxic ventilatory decline relative to acute hypoxic response was increased by > 50%. Propofol increased the depression of the acute hypoxic response after 15 min of hypoxia by approximately 25%. In control and propofol studies, no hypoxic ventilatory decline was generated during exposure to hypoxic pulses. The bispectral index-acute hypoxic response data suggest that subjects were either awake (with minimal effect on acute hypoxic response) or sedated (with 50-60% reduction of acute hypoxic response).
The depression of acute hypoxic response results from an effect of propofol at peripheral or central sites involved in respiratory control or secondary to the induction of sedation or hypnosis by propofol. The relative increase in hypoxic ventilatory decline is possibly related to propofol's action at the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor complex, causing increased GABAergic inhibition of ventilation during sustained (but not intermittent) hypoxia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10638898/

The relationships between remifentanil effect-site concentrations and BIS change or hemodynamic responses (changes in MAP and HR) to intubation were determined by logarithmic regression. BIS values were not affected by remifentanil before laryngoscopy. During this period, MAP and HR decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in the remifentanil 8 and 16 ng/mL groups. Changes in BIS, MAP, and HR were negatively correlated with remifentanil effect-site concentration (P < 0.0001). The number of movers in the remifentanil 0-, 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-ng/mL groups was, respectively, 10, 9, 7, 1, and 0. Hypotensive episodes (MAP < 60 mm Hg) were noted in 1, 2, and 5 patients in the remifentanil 4-, 8-, and 16-ng/mL groups, respectively. We conclude that the addition of remifentanil to propofol affects BIS only when a painful stimulus is applied. Moreover, remifentanil attenuated or abolished increases in BIS and MAP after tracheal intubation in a comparable dose-dependent fashion.
Bispectral index change is as sensitive as hemodynamic responses after a painful stimulus for detecting deficits in the analgesic component of anesthesia. It may, therefore, be a useful monitor of the depth of anesthesia in patients who are incapable of HR and MAP responses to noxious stimuli because of medications or cardiovascular disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10624998/
10553858,The performance of electroencephalogram bispectral index and auditory evoked potential index to predict loss of consciousness during propofol infusion.,Anesthesia and analgesia,1999,"Schraag S, Bothner U, Gajraj R, Kenny GN, Georgieff M","The bispectral index (BIS) of the electroencephalogram and middle latency auditory evoked potentials are likely candidates to measure the level of unconsciousness and, thus, may improve the early recovery profile. We prospectively investigated the predictive performance of both measures to distinguish between the conscious and unconscious state. Twelve patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery during regional anesthesia additionally received propofol by target-controlled infusion for sedation. The electroencephalogram BIS and the auditory evoked potential index (AEPi), a mathematical derivative of the morphology of the auditory evoked potential waveform, were recorded simultaneously in all patients during repeated transitions from consciousness to unconsciousness. Logistic regression procedures, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and sensitivity and specificity were used to compare predictive ability of both indices. In the logistic regression models, both the BIS and AEPi were significant predictors of unconsciousness (P < 0.0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for discrete descending index threshold values was apparently, but not significantly (P > 0.05), larger for the AEPi (0.968) than for the BIS (0.922), indicating a trend of better discriminatory performance. We conclude that both the BIS and AEPi are reliable means for monitoring the level of unconsciousness during propofol infusion. However, AEPi proved to offer more discriminatory power in the individual patient.
Both the bispectral index of the electroencephalogram and the auditory evoked potentials index are good predictors of the level of sedation and unconsciousness during propofol infusion. However, the auditory evoked potentials index offers better discriminatory power in describing the transition from the conscious to the unconscious state in the individual patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10553858/

Inhalation of 70% nitrous oxide resulted in loss of consciousness in all healthy volunteers (n = 10) but no change in BIS. Brief inhalation up to 1.2% sevoflurane also resulted in loss of consciousness in volunteers (n = 5), but with sevoflurane, BIS decreased. BIS and the haemodynamic effects of adding nitrous oxide were also measured during coronary artery bypass surgery in patients (n = 10) receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions. Measurements were made after 0%, 33%, 66% and 0% nitrous oxide, just before skin incision and after sternotomy. Nitrous oxide caused no change in BIS. BIS may indicate a sufficient hypnotic depth to prevent awareness during surgery, but our study demonstrated that pharmacological unconsciousness-hypnosis can also be reached by mechanisms to which BIS is not sensitive. Thus BIS is a sufficient but not a necessary criterion for adequate depth of anaesthesia or prevention of awareness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10562773/

Mean values for AEPIndex during consciousness and unconsciousness were 74.5 (SD 14.7) 36.7 (7.1), respectively. BIS had mean values of 89.5 (SD 4.6) during consciousness and 48.8 (16.4) during unconsciousness. AEPIndex and BIS were greater during consciousness compared with during unconsciousness. The average awake values of AEPIndex were significantly higher than all average values during unconsciousness but this was not the case for BIS. BIS increased gradually during emergence from anaesthesia and may therefore be able to predict recovery of consciousness at the end of anaesthesia.

However, in both it may be difficult to exclude evaluators' subjectivity or a placebo effect. Plasma concentration of catecholamines may also be useful for the assessment of patient anxiety. Recently bispectral electro-encephalographic analysis has been developed, and the bispectral index monitor has been reported to give measurements which correlate well with the depth of sedation. In the present study, we have examined the relation between bispectral index values and plasma catecholamine concentrations after oral diazepam premedication. Twenty-eight patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomly assigned to one of two groups: diazepam premedication group (group D(+), n = 14) and no premedication group (group D(-), n = 14). The patients were premedicated orally with diazepam 10 mg and roxatidine 75 mg in group D(+), and with roxatidine 75 mg only in group D(-) 90 min before arrival in the operating theatre. After patients arrived in the operating theatre, the bispectral index monitor was applied. Venous blood samples (6 mL) were collected in the case of patients in group D(+) for the measurement of plasma catecholamines levels using high-performance liquid chromatography. The bispectral index level (mean +/- SD) in group D(+): 93.5 +/- 773.5 was significantly lower than that in group D(-): 96.1 +/- 1.8 (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between bispectral index and plasma norepinephrine levels (r = 0.567, P < 0.05). The present study suggests that the bispectral index monitor may detect the effect of oral diazepam premedication.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10500939/

Prospective convenience sample.
Multidisciplinary 34-bed ICU at Maine Medical Center, a 599-bed nonuniversity, academic medical center.
Sixty-three adult ICU patients were monitored during 64 episodes of ventilatory support.
Patients were prospectively evaluated by one trained investigator using the revised Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) and were simultaneously monitored for 1 to 5 hrs using the Bispectral Index (BIS), a numeric scale from 0 to 100 derived from the electroencephalogram. BIS values were assigned to baseline, stimulated, and average conditions for each patient by a separate investigator blinded to SAS scores. Ventilator settings, medications, and the lung injury severity (LIS) score were also recorded. Sedation levels varied from very deep sedation (SAS score = 1, BIS score = 43) to mild agitation (SAS score = 5, BIS score = 100). Heavily sedated patients (SAS score = 1-2, n = 20) had higher FIO2 (0.52 vs. 0.42, p = .008), oxygenation index (9.4 vs. 5.4, p = .03), and LIS scores (1.3 vs. 0.7, p = .004) and lower baseline (66 vs. 78, p = .01), average (66 vs. 81, p < .001), and stimulated (89 vs. 96, p = .016) BIS scores compared with more awake patients. Patients with intermittent neuromuscular blockade use (n = 4) had higher FIO2 (0.65 vs. 0.44, p = .006), minute ventilation (14.6 vs. 9.9 L/min, p = .005), positive end-expiratory pressure (7.5 vs. 4.8 cm H2O, p = .05), oxygenation index (15.7 vs. 6.0, p < .001), and LIS scores (3.3 vs. 1.0, p = .036) and were more sedated, with higher suppression ratios (3.5 vs. 0.6, p = .05) and lower SAS scores (1.5 vs. 4, p = .035). The average BIS values correlated well with SAS (r2 = .21, p < .001).
SAS and BIS work well to describe the depth of sedation for ventilated ICU patients. Deeper sedation and intermittent neuromuscular blockade were used for patients with greater ventilatory requirements and more severe lung disease. The correlation between subjective and objective scales varied in medical, surgical, and trauma patients.

Patients lungs were ventilated to maintain end-tidal desflurane at 3% in O2/N2O (50/50) until 5 min after skin incision, followed by two consecutive 10 min periods at end-tidal desflurane 6% and 9%. bispectral index values were recorded before induction, at 3% desflurane before and 5 min after skin incision, and at 6% and 9% end-tidal desflurane. Bispectral index decreased with increasing end-tidal desflurane concentration (ANOVA: p < 0.05). The decrease in bispectral index was significant between pre-induction, 3% and 6% desflurane. No significant difference was observed at 3% desflurane before and after skin incision, or between 6 and 9% desflurane. The relationship between bispectral index and end-tidal desflurane concentration was fitted by a linear regression in each group. No significant difference in bispectral index was observed between the groups at any time.

To determine whether ketamine increases the level of propofol hypnosis when used in dissociative doses.
Descriptive case study.
Private practice office plastic surgery suites.
30 nonpremedicated ASA physical status I and II adult female (23) and male (7) patients scheduled for elective cosmetic surgery.
Hypnosis was induced via slow (60 to 80 drops [gtts]/min), dilute (5 mg/ml) propofol solution. Hypnosis was induced using the BIS monitor as an adjunct to traditional vital signs and verbal contact. Patients were engaged in conversation and note was taken of the BIS value when verbal contact was lost and when BIS appeared to stabilize (BIS1). A standardized stimulus (0.3 ml 1% lidocaine plain via 30-gauge needle) was applied to the area of the supraorbital nerve. Note was taken of the highest BIS value (BIS2) in the patient response. The BIS returned to baseline hypnosis (BIS1) and a 50-mg dissociative dose (independent of body weight) of ketamine was administered. Two minutes were allowed to elapse and then the surgeon was allowed to inject the local anesthesia for the proposed surgery. Note was taken of the BIS value (BIS3) in response to the surgeon's injection.
The average delta (BIS2 - BIS1) was 9.5 + 6.9. Patients did not move in response to the surgeon's injection: BIS3 = BIS1. When movement occurred, the injection was terminated and additional ketamine was given before resuming the injection. Sixteen patients received ketamine 50 mg, 12 received ketamine 100 mg, one received ketamine 150 mg, and one received ketamine 200 mg. Men required an average 19% less propofol than women in this group.
This study demonstrated a positive BIS response to a standardized local anesthetic stimulus during propofol-only hypnosis and a zero response during ketamine plus propofol hypnosis (dissociative anesthesia). Ketamine administered in dissociative doses does not deepen the level of propofol hypnosis. Hypnosis alone does not imply general anesthesia. Patients move in response to inadequate local anesthesia. Because the ketamine analgesia is only transitory and the primary analgesia is not given intravenously, propofol-ketamine technique is not a total intravenous anesthetic technique (TIVA). Instead, propofol-ketamine technique may be classified as a form of monitored anesthesia care (MAC).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10396711/

Using computer simulation, we addressed two questions. First, what is the decrease in an ASC's operating room (OR) staff if the time from which the surgery is finished to the time the patient leaves the OR is decreased? Second, what is the decrease in PACU nursing staffing if patients bypass phase I PACU (i.e., proceed from the OR directly to the phase II PACU)? The decrease in labor costs from rapid emergence or fast-tracking depends on how staff are compensated, how many ORs routinely run concurrently, and what percentage of patients undergo general anesthesia. The results show potential decreases in ASCs' labor costs ($7.39 per case) from technologies (e.g., new anesthetics or Bispectral Index [Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA] monitoring) to decrease emergence times or increase the phase I bypass rates.

This was performed to give a more objective idea of the relative analgesic potency of epidural clonidine.
Sixty patients undergoing intestinal surgery during propofol anesthesia were studied. At induction, the patients received epidurally a dose of 10 micrograms/kg [corrected] clonidine in 7 ml saline followed by an infusion of 6 micrograms [corrected] x kg(-1) x h(-1) (7 ml/h) (group 1, n = 20), a dose of 7 ml bupivacaine, 0.5%, followed by 7 ml/h bupivacaine, 0.25% (group 2, n = 20), or a dose of 7 ml bupivacaine, 0.25%, followed by 7 ml/h bupivacaine, 0.125% (group 3, n = 20). Intraoperatively, increases in arterial blood pressure or heart rate not responding to propofol (0.5 mg/kg) were treated with intravenous alfentanil (0.05 mg/kg). Additional doses of propofol were given to maintain an adequate bispectral index. The epidural infusions were maintained for 12 h. In cases of subjective visual analogue pain scores up to 5 cm at rest or up to 8 cm during coughing, the patients were given access to a patient-controlled analgesia device.
During anesthesia, patients in group 1 required less propofol than those in groups 2 and 3 (78 [36-142] mg vs. 229 [184-252] mg and 362 [295-458] mg; P < 0.05) and less alfentanil than patients in group 3 (0 [0-0] mg vs. 11 [6-20] mg; P < 0.05).

There was no suggestion of a hemodynamic difference among the three groups except for heart rates that were significantly reduced in patients in group 1.

Gender has not previously been recognized as a factor influencing the time to emergence from general anesthesia.
This multicenter study was originally designed to measure the effects of the bispectral index on intraoperative anesthetic management and patient recovery. We compared the wake-up and recovery times of 274 adults after propofol/alfentanil/nitrous oxide anesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned to have the titration of propofol performed with or without the use of bispectral index monitoring. Specific guidelines were given for the titration of drugs. The aim in all cases was to provide a safe anesthetic with the fastest possible recovery.
There was a significant reduction in propofol dose, time to eye opening, and response to verbal command when the anesthetic was titrated using the bispectral index. Unexpectedly, gender proved to be a highly significant independent predictor for recovery time. Women woke significantly faster than men: the time from end of anesthesia to eye opening was 7.05 versus 11.22 min, P < 0.05, and response to verbal command was 8.12 versus 11.67 min, P < 0.05. These differences were significant at all four study sites and in each treatment group. Men consistently had prolonged recovery times compared to women, P < 0.001. There was no difference in the dose of anesthetic used between gender.
Gender appears to be an important variable in recovery from general anesthesia. These findings may explain the increased reported incidence of awareness in women (three times more frequent) and support the need to include gender as a variable in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of anesthetic drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10319774/
10084098,Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring during propofol-induced sedation and anaesthesia.,European journal of anaesthesiology,1999,Singh H,"One may have to use a monitor of cortical suppression to maintain the optimal level of sedation and hypnosis. The bispectral index (BIS), a processed EEG parameter, which incorporates coupling along with the frequency and amplitude of EEG waveforms, has been proposed as a measure of the pharmacodynamic anaesthetic effect on the central nervous system. The numerical value of BIS varies from 0 to 100 (no cerebral activity to fully awake patient). In order to achieve the desired level of propofol sedation or hypnosis, a target concentration of propofol at the effect site or in the blood must be delivered. Alternately, one may use BIS monitoring to monitor hypnosis or sedation levels or to reflect propofol concentrations in the blood. Significant correlations between plasma propofol concentrations and BIS values (r = 0.68-0.78) have been reported by many investigators. During propofol-induced sedation, BIS values may be maintained above 75 to prevent airway obstruction and hypoxia. During propofol intravenous anaesthesia, BIS values from 40 to 60 have been proposed to maintain the desired level of hypnosis, with values below 50 associated with an insignificant probability of recall. However, the major limitation of the BIS monitor (monitor of hypnosis) relates to the fact that balanced anaesthesia comprises hypnosis, areflexia and analgesia and requires the administration of hypnotic agents, muscle relaxants and analgesics to achieve the desired clinical effects. Therefore, besides using the BIS value guidelines, one may also consider the haemodynamic, autonomic and somatic responses of the patient, the anaesthetic technique and the surgical interventions before deriving definite conclusions about the overall anaesthetic state of the patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10084098/

Light sleep occurred at BIS values of 75-90, slow-wave sleep occurred at BIS values of 20-70, and rapid eye movement sleep occurred at BIS values of 75-92. The effects of natural sleep on the BIS seem to be similar to the effects of general anesthesia on the BIS. The BIS may have a role in monitoring depth of sleep.

This report concerns BIS monitoring in 18 randomly selected, deeply sedated, surgical patients in the intensive care unit, who were unresponsive to standard clinical stimulation (Ramsay sedation score). A wide range of BIS was observed, with 15 of the patients having a BIS below 60, indicating a state of deep sedation (or possibly over-sedation).

Sixty consenting women undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation procedures were studied. After premedication with midazolam 2 mg IV, anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg IV, fentanyl 1.5 microg/kg IV, and succinylcholine 1 mg/kg IV and was initially maintained with either desflurane 4% (n = 31) or a propofol infusion 100 microg kg(-1) min(-1) (n = 29), in combination with nitrous oxide 65% in oxygen. Subsequently, the inspired desflurane concentrations (2%-6%) and propofol infusion rates (50-150 microg.kg(-1) min(-1) were varied to maintain a clinically acceptable depth of anesthesia. The average BIS value during the 3-min interval immediately before the discontinuation of the maintenance anesthetics was recorded. Emergence times and modified Aldrete scores were assessed from the end of anesthesia until patients were considered fast-track-eligible. The BIS values at the end of anesthesia were significantly correlated with the time to reach fast-track eligibility in both the desflurane (r = -0.68) and propofol (r = -0.76) groups. We concluded that the EEG-BIS value at the end of anesthesia is useful in predicting fast-track eligibility after laparoscopic tubal ligation procedures with either a desflurane- or propofol-based anesthetic technique.
In outpatients receiving either desflurane and propofol anesthesia for laparoscopic tubal ligation surgery, the times to achieve criteria for bypassing the recovery room (i.e., fast-tracking) correlated with the electroencephalographic-Bispectral Index values at the end of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9842806/

The relation among BIS, measured drug concentration, sedation score, and presence or absence of recall was determined by linear and logistic regression for different drug regimens, and the prediction probability (Pk) was calculated. The addition of alfentanil in increasing doses did not significantly affect the BIS50 and propofol Cp50 values for loss of consciousness and lack of recall. DeltaBIS was significantly decreased by both an increase in the concentration of propofol and the presence of alfentanil. The Pk for BIS was >0.93 with all drug regimens, better than those of the target and measured propofol concentrations. We conclude that BIS correlated well with the hypnotic component of anesthesia independent of the presence of an opioid. Moreover, the level of consciousness, and, therefore, the BIS index, is affected by a painful stimulus, and this response is ablated either by opioids or increasing propofol concentration.
In volunteers, the sedation and changes in memory function produced by propofol correlated well with changes in the Bispectral Index. This relationship was not altered by the addition of an analgesic (alfentanil). However, in moderately sedated patients who received a painful stimulus, the Bispectral Index increased, but this response was blocked by the analgesic or increasing propofol concentrations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9768800/

The authors sought to characterize the effects of N2O on quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) variables including the bispectral index (BIS), a quantitative parameter developed to correlate with the level of sedation induced by a variety of agents.
Healthy young adult volunteers (n = 13) were given a randomized sequence of N2O/O2 combinations via face mask. Five concentrations of N2O (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% atm) were administered for 15 min (20 min for the first step). EEG was recorded from bilateral frontal poles continuously. At the end of each exposure, level of sedation was assessed using primarily the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale.
One subject withdrew from the study because of emesis at 50% N2O. N2O (50%) increased theta, beta, 40-50 Hz, and 70-110 Hz band powers. BIS and spectral edge frequency during 50% N2O/O2 did not differ significantly from baseline values. Abrupt decreases from higher to lower concentrations frequently evoked a profound, transient slowing of activity. No significant change in OAA/S was detected during the study.
Although the spectral content of the EEG changed during N2O administration, reflecting some pharmacologic effect, the subjects remained cooperative and responsive throughout, and therefore N2O can only be considered a weak sedative at the tested concentrations. Despite changes in the lower and higher frequency ranges of EEG activity, the BIS did not change, which is consistent with its design objective as a specific measure of hypnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9743404/
9726194,Awareness during general anesthesia: new technology for an old problem.,CRNA : the clinical forum for nurse anesthetists,1998,Halliburton JR,"The possibility of awareness during general anesthesia causes apprehension for the patient and the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA). The goals of general anesthesia are to prevent the sensation of pain and produce a state of sedation, hypnosis, and unconsciousness so the patient will not remember the surgical procedure. An inadequate level of anesthesia can result in patient awareness during surgery. The current practice of anesthesia relies on indirect hemodynamic measurements such as blood pressure and heart rate to monitor the sedative hypnotic state of the patient's brain during general anesthesia. Hemodynamic responses are not reliable for predicting awareness just as blood pressure and heart rate are not indicative of consciousness. Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms are known to be affected by anesthetics. Characteristic EEG waveforms are a direct indication of the patient's level of consciousness. Unprocessed and computer-processed EEG recordings have been used in an attempt to monitor the patient's level of consciousness during general anesthesia. A raw or unprocessed EEG recording to monitor the level of consciousness during general anesthesia is problematic. The EEG signal is complex, affected by artifact, and it requires a dedicated interpreter. Conventional processed EEG monitoring systems are problematic because of the complexity of the equipment and technical difficulty of reading the EEG recording. The purpose of this article is to describe the history of awareness during anesthesia and introduce a new processed EEG monitor, the Bispectral Index (BIS) (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Natick, MA) with implications for future clinical use and research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9726194/
9710389,Quantitative EEG correlations with brain glucose metabolic rate during anesthesia in volunteers.,Anesthesiology,1998,Alkire MT,"To help elucidate the relationship between anesthetic-induced changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the concurrent cerebral metabolic changes caused by anesthesia, positron emission tomography data of cerebral metabolism obtained in volunteers during anesthesia were correlated retrospectively with various concurrently measured EEG descriptors.
Volunteers underwent functional brain imaging using the 18fluorodeoxyglucose technique; one scan always assessed awake-baseline cerebral metabolism (n = 7), and the other scans assessed metabolism during propofol sedation (n = 4), propofol anesthesia (n = 4), or isoflurane anesthesia (n = 5). The EEG was recorded continuously during metabolism assessment using a frontal-mastoid montage. Power spectrum variables, median frequency, 95% spectral edge, and bispectral index (BIS) values subsequently were correlated with the percentage of absolute cerebral metabolic reduction (PACMR) of glucose utilization caused by anesthesia.
The percentage of absolute cerebral metabolic reduction, evident during anesthesia, trended median frequency (r = -0.46, P = 0.11), and the spectral edge (r = -0.52, P = 0.07), and correlated with anesthetic type (r = -0.70, P < 0.05), relative beta power (r = -0.60, P < 0.05), total power (r = 0.71,P < 0.01), and bispectral index (r = -0.81,P < 0.001). After controlling for anesthetic type, only bispectral index (r = 0.40, P = 0.08) and alpha power (r = 0.37, P = 0.10) approached significance for explaining residual percentage of absolute cerebral metabolic reduction prediction error.
Some EEG descriptors correlated linearly with the magnitude of the cerebral metabolic reduction caused by propofol and isoflurane anesthesia. These data suggest that a physiologic link exists between the EEG and cerebral metabolism during anesthesia that is mathematically quantifiable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9710389/

The monitor uses bispectral analysis to derive an index of anaesthetic depth, the bispectral index (BIS). We compared reliability, impedance and BIS for each montage. ECG electrodes placed in a bifrontal montage were more reliable than silver dome electrodes in a fronto-central montage and both types of electrodes had impedances in the clinically useful range. However, BIS values derived from each montage were found to differ in an unpredictable manner. The bifrontal montage is easy to apply and reliable but it is not comparable with a fronto-central montage. We conclude that the BIS may be useful for following trends in anaesthetic depth in individual cases but it is less helpful when making comparison between patients or as a single value.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9623435/

The current study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of three EEG parameters and anesthetic concentration for predicting depth of sedation and anesthesia during sevoflurane anesthesia
One low and one high equilibrated concentration ranging from 0.2-1.8% were assigned randomly and administered consecutively to 69 patients. The bispectral index (BIS; version 3.2), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), and median power frequency (MPF) were obtained from a bipolar frontomastoid (Fp1-A1, Fp2-A2) montage using an EEG monitor. Sedation was assessed using the responsiveness portion of the observer's assessment of alertness-sedation scale. In the second phase of the study, the 47 patients who were scheduled to have skin incisions were observed for purposeful movement in response to skin incision at sevoflurane concentrations between 1.6% and 2.4%. The relation among BIS, 95% SEF, MPF, sevoflurane concentration, sedation score, and movement or no movement after skin incision, was determined. Prediction probability values for EEG parameters and sevoflurane concentration to predict depth of sedation and anesthesia were also calculated.
The BIS and sevoflurane concentration correlated closely with the sedation score. Both 95% SEF and MPF changed significantly but biphasically with increasing sedation. The prediction probability values for BIS and sevoflurane concentration were 0.966 and 0.945, respectively, indicating a high predictive performance for depth of sedation. No EEG parameters predicted movement after skin incision better than chance alone.
Parameters derived from EEG, such as BIS, and 95% SEF are reliable guides to the depth of sedation, but not to the adequacy of anesthesia level for preventing movement during sevoflurane anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9523807/

We studied 12 patients undergoing hip or knee replacement under spinal anaesthesia.

Threshold values with a specificity of 100% for a state of unconsciousness were: AEP index, 37 (sensitivity 52%); BIS, 55 (sensitivity 15%); and SEF, 16.0 (sensitivity 9%). There was no recorded value for MF that was 100% specific for unconsciousness. Of the four measurements, only AEP index demonstrated a significant difference (P < 0.05) between all mean values 1 min before recovery of consciousness and all mean values 1 min after recovery of consciousness.

In Group 1 (n = 30), the bispectral index was recorded but the anaesthetist was unaware of the readings and therefore only classical signs of depth of anaesthesia were used to guide the anaesthetist in controlling the effect-site concentration. In Group 2 (n = 28), bispectral index readings were available to the anaesthetist and effect-site concentration was adjusted to ensure that bispectral index was maintained between 40 and 60. Similar propofol induction and maintenance doses, blood and effect-site concentrations and mean bispectral index were found in the two groups. A greater percentage of bispectral index readings lying outside the target range (i.e. < 40 or > 60) and more movement at incision and during maintenance were found in Group 1. There was a trend towards more implicit awareness in patients in Group 1. Bispectral index was found to be useful for measuring depth of sedation when using propofol target-controlled infusion. Propofol dosage could not be decreased but a more consistent level of sedation could be maintained due to a more satisfactory titration of target effect-site concentration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9505735/

The purposes of this study were (1) to determine whether BIS correlates with responses to command during sedation and hypnosis induced by propofol or propofol and nitrous oxide, and (2) to compare BIS to targeted and measured concentrations of propofol in predicting participants' responses to commands.
Twenty volunteers (15 men and 5 women, aged 22-50 yr) were given propofol by computer-controlled infusion, and EEG was recorded for off-line analysis of BIS. Responses to randomly ordered verbal commands or voice plus touch were measured with two categorical scales (CS1 and CS2, respectively). All subjects received a propofol infusion targeted to achieve effect site concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, and 0 microg/ml. Ten participants had repeated infusion, whereas 10 others breathed 30% nitrous oxide and oxygen and received a propofol infusion targeted for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0 microg/ml. Five minutes after each targeted concentration had been reached, CS1, CS2, and arterial propofol concentration were determined. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to compare the accuracy of (1) BIS, (2) targeted propofol concentration, (3) measured concentration, and (4) treatment history as predictors of response.
Bispectral index was a strong predictor of CS1 and CS2 (P < 0.0001) and significantly more accurate than targeted or measured propofol concentrations (P < 0.0003 and P < 0.003, respectively). It also provided additional predictive power when combined with treatment history (P < 0.02). Nitrous oxide slightly decreased the probability of response at a given value of BIS (P < 0.05), but accuracy was unaffected.
Bispectral index accurately predicts response to verbal commands during sedation and hypnosis with propofol or propofol plus nitrous oxide. Accuracy is maintained in situations likely to be encountered during clinical use: when propofol concentrations are increasing or decreasing and when repeated measurements are made over time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9447852/

This study determined whether addition of BIS monitoring to standard anesthetic practice results in improvements in the conduct of anesthesia or in patient outcomes.
Three hundred two patients receiving a propofol-alfentanil-nitrous oxide anesthetic were studied at four institutions. Thirty-four patients were initially enrolled to determine preexisting anesthetic practice and patient outcomes at each institution. Subsequent patients were randomized to either standard clinical practice (SP group), or standard practice plus BIS monitoring (BIS group). In all patients, the anesthesiologist attempted to provide a stable anesthetic with the fastest possible recovery. BIS was recorded for all patients, but viewed only in the BIS group. In the BIS group, propofol infusions were adjusted to achieve a target BIS between 45-60, increasing to 60-75 during the final 15 min of the case. In the SP group, propofol dose adjustments were made based only on standard clinical signs. Drug use, intraoperative responses, and patient recovery parameters were recorded.
Demographics were similar between groups. Compared with the SP group, patients in the BIS group required lower normalized propofol infusion rates (134 vs. 116 microg x kg[-1] x min[-1]; P < 0.001), were extubated sooner (11.22 vs. 7.25 min; P < 0.003), had a higher percentage of patients oriented on arrival to PACU (43% vs. 23%; P < 0.02), had better postanesthesia care unit (PACU) nursing assessments (P < 0.001), and became eligible for discharge sooner (37.77 vs. 31.70 min; P <0.04). There was no significant difference in the incidence of intraoperative responses between the groups.
Titrating propofol with BIS monitoring during balanced anesthesia decreased propofol use and significantly improved recovery. Intraoperative course was not changed.

To establish its utility for this purpose, it is important to determine the relation among BIS, measured drug concentration, and increasing levels of sedation. This study was designed to evaluate this relation for four commonly used anesthetic drugs: propofol, midazolam, isoflurane, and alfentanil.
Seventy-two consenting volunteers were studied at four institutions. Volunteers were given either isoflurane, propofol, midazolam, or alfentanil. Each volunteer was administered a dose-ranging sequence of one of the study drugs to achieve predetermined target concentrations. A frontal montage was used for continuous recording of the EEG. At each pseudo-steady-state drug concentration, a BIS score was recorded, the participant was shown either a picture or given a word to recall, an arterial blood sample was obtained for subsequent analysis of drug concentration, and the participant was evaluated for level of sedation as determined by the responsiveness portion of the observer's assessment of the alertness/ sedation scale (OAAS). An OAAS score of 2 or less was considered unconscious. The BIS (version 2.5) score was recorded in real-time and the BIS (version 3.0) was subsequently derived off-line from the recorded raw EEG data. The relation among BIS, measured drug concentration, responsiveness score, and presence or absence of recall was determined by linear and logistic regression for both the individual drugs and, when appropriate, for the pooled results. The prediction probability was also calculated.
The BIS score (r = 0.883) correlated significantly better than the measured propofol concentration (r = -0.778; P < 0.05) with the responsiveness score. The BIS provided as effective correlation with responsiveness score of the OAAS as did the measured concentration for midazolam and isoflurane. None of the volunteers given alfentanil lost consciousness and thus were excluded from the pooled analysis. The pooled BIS values at which 50% and 95% of participants were unconscious were 67 and 50, respectively. The prediction probability values for BIS ranged from 0.885-0.976, indicating a very high predictive performance for correctly indicating probability of loss of consciousness.
The BIS both correlated well with the level of responsiveness and provided an excellent prediction of the loss of consciousness. These results imply that BIS may be a valuable monitor of the level of sedation and loss of consciousness for propofol, midazolam, and isoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9105228/

Bispectral index and isolated forearm technique.,Anesthesiology,1997,"Flaishon R, Windsor A, Sigl J, Sebel PS","Currently, there exists no effective monitor that can predict the probability of a patient being conscious during general anesthesia. The electroencephalogram-derived bispectral index (BIS) is a promising new method to assess anesthetic adequacy. This study used the BIS to predict the probability of recovery of consciousness after a single bolus induction dose of propofol or thiopental.
Twenty unpremedicated surgical patients were anesthetized with 4 mg/kg thiopental and 20 patients with 2 mg/kg propofol. The BIS was monitored throughout the study. After induction, before administration of neuromuscular blocking agent, a tourniquet was applied to one arm and inflated above the systolic blood pressure. This allowed preservation of the ability to move the hand after neuromuscular blocking agent onset. Patients were then prompted to squeeze the investigator's hand every 30 s, until they responded to the request. At the time of response, anesthesia was reinduced and the study terminated.
The BIS at loss of consciousness and recovery of a response was not statistically different between propofol and thiopental. No patient with a BIS less than 58 was conscious. In both groups, a BIS of less than 65 signified a less than 5% probability of return of consciousness within 50 s.

This prospective study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the BIS index and 95% SEF for assessing the level of propofol-induced sedation and amnesia during regional anesthesia. Ten consenting adult patients undergoing surgery with regional anesthesia were administered propofol in increments of 10-20 mg i.v., every 5-10 min until they became unresponsive to tactile stimulation (i.e., mild prodding or shaking). The BIS index and 95% SEF were continuously recorded from a bifrontal montage (Fp1-Cz and Fp2-Cz) using the Aspect B500 monitor. The depth of sedation was assessed clinically at 5- to 10-min intervals using the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale, with 1 = no response to tactile stimulation to 5 = wide awake. Each patient was shown a picture of an animal (cat) prior to administration of an initial dose of propofol, 40 mg i.v.. Subsequently, patients were administered intermittent bolus doses of propofol, 10-20 mg i.v., and shown different pictures upon achieving OAA/S scores of 4, 3, and 2 during the onset of and recovery from propofol-induced sedation. Picture recall was tested upon arrival of the patient in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Of the two EEG variables studied, the BIS index exhibited a better correlation with the OAA/S scores during both the onset (Spearman's rho = 0.744) and recovery (Spearman's rho = 0.705) phases of propofol-induced sedation. With the increasing depth of sedation, there was a progressive decrease in the BIS index (OAA/S score of 5, BIS = 94.5 +/- 2.9; 4, 93.3 +/- 3.3; 3, 89 +/- 6.1; 2, 80.1 +/- 8.7; 1, 75.6 +/- 7.5; mean +/- SD).

Step decreases in end-tidal partial pressure of oxygen from normoxia into hypoxia (approximately 50 mmHg) were performed in 11 healthy volunteers. Four acute hypoxic ventilatory responses were obtained per subject: one in the absence of pain and sevoflurane (C), one in the absence of sevoflurane with noxious stimulation in the form of a 1-Hz electrical current applied to the skin over the tibial bone (C + P), one in the absence of pain during the inhalation of 0.1 minimum alveolar concentration sevoflurane (S), and one during 0.1 minimum alveolar concentration sevoflurane with noxious stimulation (S + P). The end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide was held constant at a value slightly greater than baseline (44 mmHg). To assess the central nervous system arousal state, the bispectral index of the electroencephalogram was monitored. Values are mean +/- SE.
Pain caused an increase in prehypoxic baseline ventilation before and during sevoflurane inhalation: C = 13.7 +/- 0.9 l.min-1, C + P = 16.0 +/- 1.0 l.min-1 (P < 0.05 vs. C and S), S = 12.7 +/- 1.2 l.min-1, and S + P = 15.9 +/- 1.1 l.min-1 (P < 0.05 vs. C and S). Sevoflurane decreased the acute hypoxic ventilatory response in the absence and presence of noxious stimulation: C = 0.69 +/- 0.20 l.min-1 (% change in arterial hemoglobin-oxygen saturation derived from pulse oximetry [SpO2])-1, C + P = 0.64 +/- 0.13 l.min-1.%SpO2(-1), S = 0.48 +/- 0.15 l.min-1.%SpO2(-1) (P < 0.05 vs. C and C + P) and S + P = 0.46 +/- 0.21 l.min-1.%SpO2(-1) (P < 0.05 vs. C and C + P).

The observation that acute pain caused an increase in baseline ventilation with no effect on the acute hypoxic ventilatory response indicates that acute pain interacted with ventilatory control without modifying the effect of low-dose sevoflurane on the peripheral chemoreflex loop. Acute pain increased the level of arousal significantly during sevoflurane inhalation but did not restore the approximately 30% depression of the acute hypoxic ventilatory response by sevoflurane. The central nervous system arousal state per se did not contribute to the impairment of the acute hypoxic ventilatory response by sevoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8712445/

A prospective study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of various EEG parameters for assessing midazolam-induced sedation during regional anesthesia.
Twenty-six consenting adult patients were administered 4.5-20 mg intravenous midazolam (in increments of 0.5-1 mg bolus doses every 6-10 min) until they became unresponsive to tactile stimulation (i.e., mild prodding or shaking). The EEG was continuously recorded from a bifrontal montage (FP1-Cz and FP2-Cz) to obtain the bispectral index (BI), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), median frequency (MF), and delta, theta, alpha, and beta power bands. Sedation was assessed clinically at 6-10-min intervals using the Observers' Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale, with 1 = no response (unconsciousness) to tactile stimulation to 5 = wide awake. The EEG parameters were correlated with the OAA/S scores using nonparametric Spearman's rank-correlation analysis. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance was used to determine significant changes in EEG parameters during the onset of and recovery from midazolam-induced sedation.
Of the EEG parameters studied, the BI exhibited the best correlation with OAA/S scores during both the onset (Spearman's Rho = 0.815) and recovery (Spearman's Rho = 0.596) phases.

Similarly, EEG-BI increased with recovery from the sedative effects of midazolam (OAA/S score = 2:BI = 75.2 +/- 10.2; 3:82.3 +/- 7.3; 4:90.8 +/- 6). However, no consistent changes were found with the other EEG parameters. The mean EEG values between OAA/S scores 3 and 2 and between OAA/S scores 2 and 1 during the onset and recovery phases from midazolam-induced sedation, defined as EEG50 values for response to verbal command (EEG50-VC) and to shaking of the head (EEG50-SH), were 79.3 +/- 8 and 70.8 +/- 14.3, respectively, for EEG-BI. The EEG-BI displayed the smallest coefficients of variation for the EEG50-VC and EEG50-SH values.
The EEG-BI appears to be a useful parameter for assessing midazolam-induced sedation and can predict the likelihood of a patient responding to verbal commands or to shaking of the head during midazolam-induced sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8572355/
7486115,Propofol blood concentration and the Bispectral Index predict suppression of learning during propofol/epidural anesthesia in volunteers.,Anesthesia and analgesia,1995,"Leslie K, Sessler DI, Schroeder M, Walters K","Propofol is often used for sedation during regional anesthesia. We tested the hypothesis that propofol blood concentration, the Bispectral Index and the 95% spectral edge frequency predict suppression of learning during propofol/epidural anesthesia in volunteers. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that the Bispectral Index is linearly related to propofol blood concentration. Fourteen healthy, male volunteers were studied on three randomly ordered days: no propofol, target propofol blood concentration 1 microgram/mL, and target propofol blood concentration 2 micrograms/mL. Each day, epidural anesthesia (approximately T11 level) was induced using 2% 2-chloroprocaine. Propofol was infused by a computer-controlled pump, and propofol concentration measured in central venous blood. We administered a Trivial Pursuit-type question task on all 3 days. The electroencephalogram was monitored continuously (Fp1, Fp2; reference, Cz; ground, mastoid). Propofol caused concentration-related impairment of learning. The propofol blood concentration suppressing learning by 50% was 0.66 +/- 0.1 microgram/mL. The Bispectral Index value when learning was suppressed by 50% was 91 +/- 1. In contrast, the 95% spectral edge frequency did not correlate well with learning. The Bispectral Index decreased linearly as propofol blood concentration increased (Bispectral Index = -7.4.[propofol] + 90; r2 = 0.47, n = 278). There was no significant correlation between the 95% spectral edge frequency and propofol concentration. In order to suppress learning, propofol blood concentrations reported to produce amnesia may be targeted. Alternatively, the Bispectral Index may be used to predict anesthetic effect during propofol sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7486115/
7760092,EEG bispectrum predicts movement during thiopental/isoflurane anesthesia.,Journal of clinical monitoring,1995,"Sebel PS, Bowles SM, Saini V, Chamoun N","The objective of our study was to test the efficacy of the bispectral index (BIS) compared with spectral edge frequency (SEF), relative delta power, median frequency, and a combined univariate power spectral derivative in predicting movement to incision during isoflurane/oxygen anesthesia.
A total of 42 consenting patients were assigned to 3 groups, isoflurane 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC). Anesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained with the appropriate end-tidal concentration of isoflurane. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using a microcomputer system, and data were analyzed off-line. The EEG during the 2 min before incision was analyzed. Following skin incision, each patient was carefully observed for 60 sec to detect occurrence of purposeful movement.
For all groups combined, there was a statistically significant difference for BIS (p < 0.0001) and also for relative delta power (p < 0.016) between movers and nonmovers. There was a statistically significant difference between movers and nonmovers at 1.25 MAC isoflurane for BIS (p < 0.01). There were no other significant differences for any other EEG variable at any concentration of isoflurane. No EEG variable showed a relationship to isoflurane concentration.
When bispectral analysis of the EEG was used to develop a retrospectively determined index, there was an association of the index with movement. Thus, it may be a useful predictor of whether patients will move in response to skin incision during anesthesia with isoflurane/oxygen.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7760092/
7992904,Bispectral analysis of the electroencephalogram correlates with patient movement to skin incision during propofol/nitrous oxide anesthesia.,Anesthesiology,1994,"Kearse LA, Manberg P, Chamoun N, deBros F, Zaslavsky A","Bispectral analysis is a signal-processing technique that determines the harmonic and phase relations among the various frequencies in the electroencephalogram. Our purpose was to compare the accuracy of a bispectral descriptor, the bispectral index, with that of three power spectral variables (95% spectral edge, median frequency, and relative delta power) in predicting patient movement in response to skin incision during propofol-nitrous oxide anesthesia.
Forty-four adult patients scheduled for elective noncranial surgery were studied. Gold cup electroencephalographic electrodes were placed on each patient in a frontoparietal montage (Fp1, Fp2, P3, and P4) referred to Cz, and the electroencephalogram was recorded continuously and processed off-line. Conventional frequency bands were used to describe power spectrum variables. Anesthesia was induced with propofol (1.5-3.0 mg-1.kg-1) and maintained with 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen and with propofol at one of three randomized infusion rates (100, 200, or 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). Inadequate anesthetic depth was defined as patient movement in response to a 2-cm skin incision at the planned site of surgery. Plasma propofol concentrations were measured within 2 min after skin incision.
Complete data were available for 38 patients, of whom 17 moved in response to skin incision. Analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves showed that only for bispectral index and drug dose group was there a significant predictive relation (area > 0.5). Furthermore, the bispectrum was significantly predictive even after stratification by dose group.
The bispectral index of the electroencephalogram is a more accurate predictor of patient movement in response to skin incision during propofol-nitrous oxide anesthesia than are standard power spectrum parameters or plasma propofol concentrations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7992904/
7511501,Bispectral analysis of the electroencephalogram during induction of anesthesia may predict hemodynamic responses to laryngoscopy and intubation.,Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology,1994,"Kearse LA, Manberg P, DeBros F, Chamoun N, Sinai V","The use of electroencephalography as a measure of adequacy of anesthesia has achieved limited success. Our purpose was to determine whether the non-linear properties of the electroencephalogram (EEG) as defined by the bispectral index was a better predictor of autonomic responses to endotracheal intubation during opioid-based anesthesia than the linear statistical properties of the EEG formulated by power spectral analysis. Thirty-nine adults scheduled for elective non-cranial surgery had a continuous EEG recorded during induction of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia consisted of thiopental and nitrous oxide in oxygen, followed by 1 of 5 randomized opioid dose regimens. The EEG was continuously recorded and blood pressure was measured every minute. All electroencephalographic parameters were derived for the 3 min before and after intubation and were compared to the blood pressure and heart rate responses. Responders were defined by 2 analyses: patients who had a 20% or greater increase (1) in blood pressure or (2) in heart rate to laryngoscopy. Responders and non-responders were compared using Student's unpaired t test, and differences due to dose regimens were examined with logistic regression. Based on the criterion for blood pressure change, there were 27 responders and 12 non-responders. Heart rate changes did not differentiate between the two groups. There was a significant difference between response groups as measured by the bispectral index which distinguished responders from non-responders independently of the amount of drug given. None of the variables of power spectral analysis accurately distinguished responder from non-responder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7511501/
8217181,Mild core hyperthermia does not alter electroencephalographic responses during epidural-enflurane anesthesia in humans.,Journal of clinical anesthesia,1993,"Lopez M, Ozaki M, Sessler DI, Valdes M","To determine the electroencephalographic (EEG) changes induced by mild hyperthermia during enflurane anesthesia and to test the reliability of two new infrared thermometers.
Prospective laboratory evaluation.
The Thermoregulation Research Laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco.
6 healthy female volunteers aged 30 +/- 8 years.
Epidural anesthesia (approximately T10 dermatome) was induced and maintained using 2-chloroprocaine anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced by inhalation of nitrous oxide and enflurane and maintained with enflurane at an end-tidal concentration of 1.7%. A minimum of 2 degrees C core hyperthermia was induced by active cutaneous warming, and the volunteers subsequently were passively cooled.
EEG data were recorded from gold cup electrodes positioned at FP1 and FP2, with the reference electrode at CZ and the ground lead on the mastoid. In addition to routine EEG parameters, we evaluated the bispectral index. Bispectral analysis quantifies the phase coupling between various frequencies in the power spectrum and may be a useful measure of anesthetic depth. Core temperature was measured at the left tympanic membrane and distal esophagus. Core temperature also was determined from the right ear using two new, infrared tympanic membrane thermometers. One of these directly measures tympanic temperature, and the other extrapolates core temperature from the external ear canal. Induction of 2 degrees C core hyperthermia did not produce statistically significant or clinically important changes in beta or delta power, the 95% spectral edge frequency, or the bispectral index. Temperatures recorded from the right ear by the direct thermometer were 0.27 degrees C +/- 0.33 degrees C less than those measured in the left ear, but the values correlated well (r2 = 0.95 +/- 0.04). Temperatures recorded from the right ear by the core temperature extrapolater were 0.42 degrees C +/- 0.33 degrees C lower than those measured in the left ear, and the correlation between values was slightly worse (r2 = 0.83 +/- 0.16).
Since mild core hyperthermia does not alter routine EEG parameters or the bispectral index, typical perianesthetic thermal disturbances are unlikely to obscure EEG estimates of anesthetic depth. Both the direct thermometer and the core temperature extrapolater were found to be sufficiently accurate and precise for routine clinical use, but the direct thermometer would be preferable in the perioperative period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8217181/
