Combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI), these systems can shift clinical monitoring from being reactive to predictive, allowing for earlier detection of deterioration and more personalized interventions. The value of these technologies lies not in absolute measurements, but in detecting physiological parameters trends relative to each patient's baseline. Such a trend-based approach enables real-time prediction of deterioration, enhancing patient safety and continuity of care. However, despite their shared multiparametric capabilities, WDs are not interchangeable.

40603351,Prevalence and associated factors of at risk of anemia among children under five in Northeast Thailand using noninvasive hemoglobin screening in a cross sectional study.,Scientific reports,2025,"Saengnipanthkul S, Sirikarn P, Musikaboonleart S, Tran LC, Puwanant M","Pediatric anemia remains a significant public health challenge in Northeast Thailand, where hemoglobinopathies and nutritional deficiencies coexist. Early identification of children at risk of anemia is crucial to prevent developmental and health consequences. This study assessed the prevalence of children under five being at risk of anemia using Masimo Rad-67® with Rainbow DCI-mini Sensor, while evaluating the association between caregivers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices on complementary feeding and childhood anemia. A clustered randomized cross-sectional study was conducted involving 2,000 child-caregiver pairs (aged 6 months to 5 years) in Northeast Thailand from September 2022 to March 2023. Non-invasive hemoglobin measurement was used, with anemia risk defined as spectrophotometry hemoglobin (SpHb) < 13.0 g/dL. Data collection included demographic characteristics, natal history, and feeding practices. Additionally, a survey was conducted to assess associated factors of anemia and caregivers' attitudes, knowledge, and practices regarding complementary feeding. The study found a 36.9% prevalence of at-risk anemia. Key predictors included age under 24 months (adjusted OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.7-2.6), maternal thalassemia trait (adjusted OR 1.8, 95%CI 1.4-2.3), and wasting (adjusted OR 1.6, 95%CI 1.2-2.1). Iron supplementation was a protective factor. Despite 48.2% of children receiving iron supplementation per government policy, only 24.6% met the daily iron intake according to the Thai dietary reference intake. Gap in caregiver knowledge persisted, with 68.1% of caregivers having received education on iron deficiency anemia, and only 32% able to name iron-rich foods. Public health strategies should combine nutritional education targeting iron-rich complementary feeding, implementation of a thalassemia-integrated screening protocol, and proactive community surveillance programs to improve iron intake.

However, few infants attend anaemia screening programmes due to poor cooperation and being time-consuming. This study evaluated the accuracy of noninvasive total haemoglobin (Hb) spot-check monitoring as part of anaemia screening in healthy infants, compared with the conventional laboratory method.
A cross-sectional study was conducted using a consecutive sampling technique.
The study was carried out at the Well-Child Clinic, Khon Kaen University, Thailand.
Healthy, full-term infants aged 6-12 months who were scheduled for vaccination. Spectrophotometric haemoglobin (SpHb) was measured using Masimo Rad-67 with Rainbow DCI-mini Sensor. These values were compared with conventional laboratory analysis (HbLab) performed on the same day.
Differences between Hb values using the two methods were analysed using the Bland-Altman method. Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) for detecting anaemia were determined. Anaemia was defined as HbLab of <11.0 g/dL.
A total of 104 infants, with a median age of 9.6 (IQR 9.3, 10.9) months, were included. The prevalence of anaemia, defined by HbLab, was 38.46%. The mean SpHb was 12.20±1.10 g/dL, while the mean HbLab was 11.19±1.21 g/dL. A moderate positive correlation was observed (
A noninvasive tool for measuring Hb, with moderate sensitivity and NPV, may provide utility for initial screening to reduce unnecessary venipuncture in infants. However, its limited specificity and PPV necessitate confirmatory testing through conventional laboratory methods for accurate diagnosis. Depending on the context and available resources, it has potential to complement existing diagnostic processes, particularly in settings where rapid and noninvasive screening is prioritised.

39546216,New sensors for the early detection of clinical deterioration on general wards and beyond - a clinician's perspective.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2025,"Michard F, Saugel B","The early detection of clinical deterioration could be the next significant step in enhancing patient safety in general hospital wards. Most patients do not deteriorate suddenly; instead, their vital signs are often abnormal or trending towards an abnormal range hours before severe adverse events requiring rescue intervention and/or ICU transfer. To date, at least 10 large clinical studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in severe adverse events when heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and/or respiratory rate are continuously monitored on medical and surgical wards. Continuous, silent, and automatic monitoring of vital signs also presents the opportunity to eliminate unnecessary spot-checks for stable patients. This could lead to a reduction in nurse workload, while significantly improving patient comfort, sleep quality, and overall satisfaction. Wireless and wearable sensors are particularly valuable, as they make continuous monitoring feasible even for ambulatory patients, raising questions about the future relevance of ""stay-in-bed"" solutions like capnography, bed sensors, and video-monitoring systems. While the number of wearable sensors and mobile monitoring solutions is rapidly growing, independent validation studies on their sensitivity and specificity in detecting abnormal vital signs in actual patients, rather than healthy volunteers, remain limited. Additionally, further research is needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using wireless wearables for vital sign monitoring both within hospital wards and at home.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39546216/

This study compares 5 alternate configurations of the Masimo Sedline Sensor.
Ten stably sedated patients in the intensive care unit were recruited. Frontal EEG was monitored in the standard configuration (bifrontal upright) and 5 alternate configurations: bifrontal inverse, infraorbital, lateral upright, lateral inverse, and semilateral. Average power spectral densities (PSDs) with 95% CIs in the alternate configurations were compared to PSDs in the standard configuration. Two-one-sided-testing with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests assessed equivalence in the spectral edge frequency (SEF-95), EEG power, and relative delta (0.5 to 3.5 Hz), alpha (8 to 12 Hz), and beta (20 to 30 Hz) power between each alternate and standard configurations.
After the removal of unanalyzable tracings, 7 patients were included for analysis in the infraorbital configuration and 9 in all other configurations. In the lateral upright and lateral inverse configurations, PSDs significantly differed from the standard configuration within the 15 to 20 Hz band. The greatest decrease in EEG power was in the lateral inverse configuration (median: -97 dB; IQR: -130, -62 dB).

This prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized study will enroll 100 adult American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-III patients presenting for elective procedures requiring general anesthesia. BIS and SedLine electrodes will be placed preoperatively according to manufacturer recommendations and their respective indices tracked throughout anesthesia induction, maintenance and emergence. The concordance between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthesia depth will be analyzed with chi-square and kappa statistic.
Prior studies comparing brain function monitoring devices have applied both sensors on the forehead of study subjects simultaneously. With limited space and common sensor locations between devices, it is not possible to place both commercial sensor arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations, thus compromising the validity of these comparisons.

However, the sigmoidal nature of oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation limits the accuracy of estimation of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) >80 mm Hg and correspondingly limits the ability to identify when Pao2 >80 mm Hg but falling. We hypothesized that a proxy measurement for oxygen saturation (Oxygen Reserve Index [ORI]) derived from multiwavelength pulse oximetry may allow additional warning time before critical desaturation or hypoxia. To test our hypothesis, we used a Masimo multiwavelength pulse oximeter to compare ORI and Spo2 warning times during apnea in high-risk surgical patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
This institutional review board-approved prospective study (NCT03021473) enrolled American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status III or IV patients scheduled for elective surgery with planned preinduction arterial catheter placement. In addition to standard monitors, an ORI sensor was placed and patients were monitored with a pulse oximeter displaying the ORI, a nondimensional parameter that ranges from 0 to 1. Patients were then preoxygenated until ORI plateaued. Following induction of anesthesia, mask ventilation with 100% oxygen was performed until neuromuscular blockade was established. Endotracheal intubation was accomplished using videolaryngoscopy to confirm placement. The endotracheal tube was not connected to the breathing circuit, and patients were allowed to be apneic. Ventilation was resumed when Spo2 reached 94%. We defined ORI warning time as the time from when the ORI alarm registered (based on the absolute value and the rate of change) until the Spo2 decreased to 94%. We defined the Spo2 warning time as the time for Spo2 to decrease from 97% to 94%. The added warning time provided by ORI was defined as the difference between ORI warning time and Spo2 warning time.
Forty subjects were enrolled. Complete data for analysis were available from 37 patients. The ORI alarm registered before Spo2 decreasing to 97% in all patients. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) ORI warning time was 80.4 seconds (59.7-105.9 seconds). Median (IQR) Spo2 warning time was 29.0 seconds (20.5-41.0 seconds). The added warning time provided by ORI was 48.4 seconds (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.4-62.0 seconds; P < .0001).
In adult high-risk surgical patients, ORI provided clinically relevant added warning time of impending desaturation compared to Spo2. This additional time may allow modification of airway management, earlier calls for help, or assistance from other providers.

Infants were crossed over to the other intervention for a further 10 min, totalling 20 min recording per infant. Primary outcome was faster acquisition of data with shielding of pulse oximeter sensor as compared with not shielding.
A total of 96 babies were recruited. There was no difference in primary outcome of time taken to display valid data between the two groups (opaque wrap: 12.73±3.1 s vs no opaque wrap: 13.16±3.3 s, p=0.27). There was no difference in any of the secondary outcomes (percentage of valid data points, percentage of time saturation below target, and so on) between the two groups in both pulse oximeters. Masimo sensor readings displayed a higher mean oxygen saturation (mean difference of 2.85, p=0.001) and lower percentage of time saturation below 94% (mean difference of -27.8, p=0.001) than Nellcor in both groups. There was no difference in any of the outcomes in babies receiving phototherapy (n=21).
In this study, shielding the pulse oximeter sensor from ambient light or phototherapy light did not yield faster data acquisition or better data quality.

Recent innovations have resulted in wireless and 'wearable' sensors, which may capture patient deterioration at an early stage, but little is known regarding their ability to timely detect events. The objective of this study is to describe the ability of currently available wireless sensors to detect adverse events in high-risk patients.
A descriptive analysis was performed of all vital signs trend data obtained during an observational comparison study of wearable sensors for vital signs monitoring in high-risk surgical patients during the initial days of recovery at a surgical step-down unit (SDU) and subsequent traumatology or surgical oncology ward.

Early signs of deterioration may therefore be missed. Wireless sensors have been developed that may capture patient deterioration earlier. The objective of this study was to determine whether two wearable patch sensors (SensiumVitals [Sensium Healthcare Ltd., United Kingdom] and HealthPatch [VitalConnect, USA]), a bed-based system (EarlySense [EarlySense Ltd., Israel]), and a patient-worn monitor (Masimo Radius-7 [Masimo Corporation, USA]) can reliably measure heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) continuously in patients recovering from major surgery.
In an observational method comparison study, HR and RR of high-risk surgical patients admitted to a step-down unit were simultaneously recorded with the devices under test and compared with an intensive care unit-grade monitoring system (XPREZZON [Spacelabs Healthcare, USA]) until transition to the ward. Outcome measures were 95% limits of agreement and bias. Clarke Error Grid analysis was performed to assess the ability to assist with correct treatment decisions. In addition, data loss and duration of data gaps were analyzed.
Twenty-five high-risk surgical patients were included. More than 700 h of data were available for analysis. For HR, bias and limits of agreement were 1.0 (-6.3, 8.4), 1.3 (-0.5, 3.3), -1.4 (-5.1, 2.3), and -0.4 (-4.0, 3.1) for SensiumVitals, HealthPatch, EarlySense, and Masimo, respectively. For RR, these values were -0.8 (-7.4, 5.6), 0.4 (-3.9, 4.7), and 0.2 (-4.7, 4.4) respectively. HealthPatch overestimated RR, with a bias of 4.4 (limits: -4.4 to 13.3) breaths/minute. Data loss from wireless transmission varied from 13% (83 of 633 h) to 34% (122 of 360 h) for RR and 6% (47 of 727 h) to 27% (182 of 664 h) for HR.
All sensors were highly accurate for HR. For RR, the EarlySense, SensiumVitals sensor, and Masimo Radius-7 were reasonably accurate for RR.

The perfusion index (PI) corresponds to the ratio of pulsatile to nonpulsatile blood flow at a monitoring site and can be used to quantify perfusion of the extremities. The purpose of this study was to use PI to compare the perfusion of clubfeet to controls in order to further assess the role of abnormal vasculature in clubfoot.
A Masimo Radical 7 Pulse Oximeter (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, California) was used to measure the PI and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of the feet of children 5 years of age and younger with and without clubfoot. The sensor was placed on the great toe. Patients with clubfoot undergoing non-operative treatment and control patients undergoing treatment in a clinic for orthopedic concerns not involving the foot and with no known vascular issues were assessed. The PI and SpO2 for the following three groups were compared: 1. affected feet of patients with bilateral or unilateral clubfoot, 2. unaffected feet of patients with unilateral clubfoot, and 3. control feet.
One hundred and twenty-eight patients were enrolled, 64 with clubfoot (31 bilateral and 33 unilateral) and 64 controls. No significant differences in PI or SpO2 were found between: 64 clubfeet and 64 feet of controls (PI of 2.9 vs. 2.9, p = 0.984; SpO2 of 97.1 vs. 98.1, p = 0.192); unaffected feet of 30 patients with unilateral clubfoot and 64 controls (PI of 3.0 vs.2.9, p = 0.907; SpO2 of 96.9 vs. 98.1, p = 0.224); and affected and unaffected feet of 30 patients with unilateral clubfoot (PI of 3.3 vs.3.0, p = 0.500; SpO2 of 97.4 vs. 96.9, p = 0.527).

Twenty-four infants under 12 months of age with baseline oxygen saturation less than 90% due to cyanotic CHD.
Pulse oximetry with WristOx2 3150 with infant sensors 8008 J (study device) and Masimo LCNS saturation sensor connected to a Philips monitor (hospital device) were measured simultaneously and compared to arterial oxy-haemoglobin saturation measured by co-oximetry. Statistical analysis evaluated the performances of each and compared to co-oximetry with Schuirmann's TOST equivalence tests, with equivalence defined as an absolute difference of 5% saturation or less. Neither the study nor the hospital device met the predefined standard for equivalence when compared with co-oximetry. The study device reading was on average 4.0% higher than the co-oximeter, failing to show statistical equivalence (p = 0.16). The hospital device was 7.4% higher than the co-oximeter and also did not meet the predefined standard for equivalence (p = 0.97).
Both devices tended to overestimate oxygen saturation in this patient population when compared to the gold standard, co-oximetry.

Non-invasive hemodynamic monitors provide markers of cardiac function. This pilot study sought to evaluate the ability of a non-invasive hemodynamic monitor to detect cardiac stress during formal stress echocardiography testing. The primary goal was to compare the change in hemodynamic values during the pre/during/post phases of stress echocardiography testing in patients who had results negative versus positive for myocardial ischemia. Adult patients scheduled for outpatient cardiac stress testing were screened. Only patients scheduled for stress-echocardiography testing were consented. Patients with history of arrhythmias were excluded. During the testing, patients wore a cuff-based hemodynamic sensor (Nexfin system, Edwards Lifesciences). Data from the hemodynamic sensor were compared to the findings of the stress study. A total of 37 patients were enrolled, with 31 patients included for analysis. Five patients had stress studies positive for coronary ischemia. Comparison of the hemodynamic variables between patients who had a positive stress study versus negative showed a significant reduction in the percentage change in dP/dt and stroke volume from baseline (p < 0.05).

OxiMA, an algorithm based on the time-frequency components of a photoplethysmogram (PPG), was evaluated using 22-min datasets recorded from 10 subjects during voluntarily-induced hypoxia, with and without subject-induced MAs. A Nellcor OxiMax transmission sensor was used to collect an analog PPG while reference oxygen saturation and pulse rate (PR) were collected simultaneously from an FDA-approved Masimo SET Radical RDS-1 pulse oximeter.
The performance of our approach was determined by computing the mean relative error between the PR/oxygen saturation estimated by OxiMA and the reference Masimo oximeter. The average estimation error using OxiMA was 3 beats/min for PR and 3.24% for oxygen saturation, respectively.
The results show that OxiMA has great potential for improving the accuracy of PR and oxygen saturation estimation during MAs.

This study aimed to assess prospectively the relationship between fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) and the bias of the measurement of Hb by the use of 2 different noninvasive monitors compared with the classic invasive technique.
Forty-four patients were included prospectively. In each individual, Hb level was determined noninvasively by monitor Pronto-7™ (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA) and by monitor NBM-200MP™ (OrSense Ltd, Petah-Tikva, Israel), with the probe placed on 2 fingers on the same hand of the patient. Three measures were performed, first under breathing air and 2 others when fraction of expired oxygen rose to 50% ± 5% and to 90 ± 5%. Simultaneously, a nurse collected a venous blood sample, which was sent immediately to the hematology laboratory for Hb measurement. The main outcome measurement was the mean bias between noninvasive and invasive measurements.

The Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) is a novel pulse oximeter-based nondimensional index that ranges from 1 to 0 as PaO2 decreases from about 200 to 80 mmHg and is measured by optically detecting changes in SvO2 after SaO2 saturates to the maximum. The authors tested the hypothesis that the ORI provides a clinically important warning of impending desaturation in pediatric patients during induction of anesthesia.
After preoxygenation, anesthesia induction, and tracheal intubation, the anesthesia circuit was disconnected and oxygen saturation was allowed to decrease to 90% before ventilation recommenced. The ORI and SpO2 values were recorded from a Masimo Pulse Co-Oximeter Sensor at the beginning of apnea, beginning and end of intubation, beginning and end of the ORI alarm, and 2 min after reoxygenation.
Data from 25 healthy children, aged 7.6 ± 4.6 yr, were included in the analysis. During apnea, the ORI slowly and progressively decreased over a mean of 5.9 ± 3.1 min from 0.73 ± 0.16 at the beginning of apnea to 0.37 ± 0.11. SpO2 remained 100% throughout this initial period.

Pulse oximetry (PO) can be used to detect hypoxemia, but its application in low-income countries has been limited, and its feasibility in the routine assessment of young infants (aged 0-59 days) has not been previously studied. The aim of this study was to characterize the operational feasibility and parent/guardian acceptability of incorporating PO into the routine clinical assessment of young infants in a primary care setting in a low-income country.
This was a cross-sectional study of 862 visits by 529 infants at two primary care clinics in Karachi, Pakistan (March to June, 2013). After clinical assessment, oxygen saturation (Sp02) was measured by a handheld PO device (Rad-5v, Masimo Corporation) according to a standardized protocol. Performance time (PT) was the time between sensor placement and attainment of an acceptable PO reading (i.e., stable SpO2 + 1% for at least 10 s, heart rate displayed, and adequate signal indicators). PT included the time for one repeat attempt at a different anatomical site if the first attempt did not yield an acceptable reading within 1 min. Parent/guardian acceptability of PO was based on a questionnaire and unprompted comments about the procedure. All infants underwent physician assessment.
Acceptable PO readings were obtained in ≤ 1 and ≤ 5 min at 94.4% and 99.8% of visits, respectively (n = 862). Median PT was 42 s (interquartile range 37; 50). Parents/guardians overwhelmingly accepted PO (99.6% overall satisfaction, n = 528 first visits). Of 10 infants with at least one visit with Sp02 <92% on a first PO attempt, 3 did not have a significant acute illness on physician assessment. There were no PO-related adverse events.
Using a commercially available handheld pulse oximeter, acceptable Sp02 measurements were obtained in nearly all infants in under 1 minute. The procedure was readily integrated into existing assessment pathways and parents/guardians had positive views of the technology.
When incorporated into routine clinical assessment of young infants at primary care clinics in a low-income country, PO was feasible and acceptable to parents/guardians.

The aim of this study is to examine a severely injured trauma patient population to determine whether a noninvasive SpHb monitor can predict the need for urgent blood transfusion (universal donor or additional urgent blood transfusion) during the first 12 h of trauma patient resuscitation. We hypothesize that trends in continuous SpHb, combined with easily derived patient-specific factors, can identify the immediate need for transfusion in trauma patients. Subjects were enrolled if directly admitted to the trauma center, >17 years of age, and with a shock index (heart rate/systolic blood pressure) >0.62. Upon admission, a Masimo Radical-7 co-oximeter sensor (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA) was applied, providing measurement of continuous non-invasive hemoglobin (SpHb) levels. Blood was drawn and hemoglobin concentration analyzed and conventional pulse oximetry photopletysmograph signals were continuously recorded. Demographic information and both prehospital and admission vital signs were collected. The primary outcome was transfusion of at least one unit of packed red blood cells within 24 h of admission. Eight regression models (C1-C8) were evaluated for the prediction of blood use by comparing area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) at different time intervals after admission. 711 subjects had continuous vital signs waveforms available, to include heart rate (HR), SpHb and SpO2 trends. When SpHb was monitored for 15 min, SpHb did not increase AUROC for prediction of transfusion. The highest ROC was recorded for model C8 (age, sex, prehospital shock index, admission HR, SpHb and SpO2) for the prediction of blood products within the first 3 h of admission. When data from 15 min of continuous monitoring were analyzed, significant improvement in AUROC occurred as more variables were added to the model; however, the addition of SpHb to any of the models did not improve AUROC significantly for prediction of blood use within the first 3 h of admission in comparison to analysis of conventional oximetry features. The results demonstrate that SpHb monitoring, accompanied by continuous vital signs data and adjusted for age and sex, has good accuracy for the prediction of need for transfusion; however, as an independent variable, SpHb did not enhance predictive models in comparison to use of features extracted from conventional pulse oximetry. Nor was shock index better than conventional oximetry at discriminating hemorrhaging and prediction of casualties receiving blood. In this population of trauma patients, noninvasive SpHb monitoring, including both trends and absolute values, did not enhance the ability to predict the need for blood transfusion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25753142/

In this observational study, 30 patients aged 18 or older, hospitalized at the Emergency Department for drug or alcoholic poisoning, without any contraindication to a face mask and/or a cervical acoustic sensor, were included in the study. They benefited from a simultaneous recording of their respiration rate by the acoustic method (RRa(®), Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA, USA), by thoracic impedance (Philips Intellivue(®) MP2, Suresnes, France) and by capnometry (Capnostream(®) 20, Oridion, Jerusalem, Israël) through a face mask (Capnomask(®), Mediplus Ltd, Raleigh, NC, USA) for 40-60 min. Of the 86,578 triplets collected, 77,155 (89.1%) were exploitable. Median (range) respiration rate measured by capnometry was 18 (7-29) bpm. Compared to capnometry, bias and limits of agreement were 0.1 ± 3.8 bpm for the acoustic method and 0.3 ± 5.5 bpm for thoracic impedance. The proportions of RR values collected by acoustic method or by thoracic impedance which differed over 10 or 20% during more than 15 s, compared to capnometry, were 8.3 versus 14.3, and 1.5 versus 3.8%, respectively (p < 0.0001). The acoustic sensor had to be repositioned on three patients. For 11 patients, the Capnomask(®) was removed several times. In patients with drug or alcoholic poisoning, the acoustic method seems more accurate than thoracic impedance and better tolerated than face mask capnometry.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25614223/
25405692,Absolute and trend accuracy of a new regional oximeter in healthy volunteers during controlled hypoxia.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2014,"Redford D, Paidy S, Kashif F","Traditional patient monitoring may not detect cerebral tissue hypoxia, and typical interventions may not improve tissue oxygenation. Therefore, monitoring cerebral tissue oxygen status with regional oximetry is being increasingly used by anesthesiologists and perfusionists during surgery. In this study, we evaluated absolute and trend accuracy of a new regional oximetry technology in healthy volunteers.
A near-infrared spectroscopy sensor connected to a regional oximetry system (O3™, Masimo, Irvine, CA) was placed on the subject's forehead, to provide continuous measurement of regional oxygen saturation (rSO2). Reference blood samples were taken from the radial artery and internal jugular bulb vein, at baseline and after a series of increasingly hypoxic states induced by altering the inspired oxygen concentration while maintaining normocapnic arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2). Absolute and trend accuracy of the regional oximetry system was determined by comparing rSO2 against reference cerebral oxygen saturation (SavO2), that is calculated by combining arterial and venous saturations of oxygen in the blood samples.
Twenty-seven subjects were enrolled. Bias (test method mean error), standard deviation of error, standard error of the mean, and root mean square accuracy (ARMS) of rSO2 compared to SavO2 were 0.4%, 4.0%, 0.3%, and 4.0%, respectively. The limits of agreement were 8.4% (95% confidence interval, 7.6%-9.3%) to -7.6% (95% confidence interval, -8.4% to -6.7%). Trend accuracy analysis yielded a relative mean error of 0%, with a standard deviation of 2.1%, a standard error of 0.1%, and an ARMS of 2.1%. Multiple regression analysis showed that age and skin color did not affect the bias (all P > 0.1).
Masimo O3 regional oximetry provided absolute root-mean-squared error of 4% and relative root-mean-squared error of 2.1% in healthy volunteers undergoing controlled hypoxia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25405692/

We assessed the trending and accuracy of SpHb by this innovative monitoring compared with Hb concentration obtained with conventional laboratory techniques (Hb) in children undergoing surgical procedures with potential for substantial blood loss.
Hb concentrations were recorded from Pulse CO-Oximetry and a conventional hematology analyzer. Regression analysis and 4-quadrant plot were used to evaluate the trending for changes in SpHb and Hb measurements (ΔSpHb and ΔHb). Bias, precision, and limits of agreement of SpHb and of in vivo adjusted SpHb (SpHb - first bias to HB) compared with Hb were calculated.
One hundred fifty-eight SpHb-Hb data pairs and 105 delta pairs (ΔSpHb and ΔHb) from 46 patients aged 2 months to 17 years with Hb ranging from 16.7 to 7.9 g/dL were collected. To evaluate trending, the delta pairs (ΔSpHb and ΔHb) were plotted, which revealed a positive correlation (ΔSpHb = 0.022 + 0.76ΔHb) with correlation coefficient r = 0.76, 95% CI [confidence interval] = 0.57-0.86. The bias and precision of SpHb to Hb and in vivo adjusted SpHb were 0.4 ± 1.3 g/dL and 0.1 ± 1.2 g/dL, respectively; the limits of agreement were -2.0 to 3.2 g/dL before in vivo adjustment and -2.4 to 2.2 g/dL after in vivo adjustment (P value = 0.04). The mean percent bias (from the reference Hb concentration) decreased from 4.1% ± 11.9% to 0.7% ± 11.3% (P value = 0.01). No drift in bias over time was observed during the study procedure. Of patient demographic and physiological factors tested for correlation with the SpHb, only perfusion index at sensor site showed a weak correlation.
The accuracy of SpHb in children with normal Hb and mild anemia is similar to that previously reported in adults and is independent of patient demographic and physiological states except for a weak correlation with perfusion index. The trending of SpHb and Hb in children with normal Hb and mild anemia showed a positive correlation. Further studies are necessary in children with moderate and severe anemia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25036374/
24651230,A comparison of lidocaine and bupivacaine digital nerve blocks on noninvasive continuous hemoglobin monitoring in a randomized trial in volunteers.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2014,"Miller RD, Ward TA, McCulloch CE, Cohen NH","Blood hemoglobin can be monitored continuously and noninvasively with a noninvasive spectrophotometric sensor (Masimo SpHb). The perfusion index (PI) of the finger is directly related to the clinical accuracy of SpHb. We evaluated those variables that influence PI without the influences of surgery and anesthesia.
Based on our past studies, 12 awake adult volunteers were studied. A SpHb sensor was attached to the same finger of each hand. The temperature of each finger was measured via a skin surface probe. A digital nerve block (DNB) was performed with 1% lidocaine on one finger and 0.25% bupivacaine on the other finger of the opposite hand. SpHb, PI, and finger temperature were monitored continuously 30 minutes before and 3 to 4 hours after placement of the DNB. A random effects spline regression was used to flexibly model the outcomes before and after the DNB and to compare the effects of lidocaine and bupivacaine.
The DNBs increased the PI for both lidocaine and bupivacaine (P < 0.0001) and finger temperature from both lidocaine (P < 0.0001) and bupivacaine (P = 0.02). The duration of action of bupivacaine was markedly longer than that of lidocaine (P < 0.0001). Between 45 and 75 minutes after insertion of the DNB, the PI with bupivacaine was substantially higher than that of lidocaine. The PI was directly related to changes in finger temperature and SpHb. During this time interval, 11 of the 12 volunteers receiving bupivacaine descriptively had increases in finger temperature ranging from no change to 6.1°C. In contrast, only 6 of the 12 lidocaine volunteers had increases in finger temperature ranging from no change to 4°C. Changes in PI were directly correlated with SpHb values (correlation coefficient = 0.7).
A DNB increases PI and finger temperature. These increases lasted 2 to 3 hours longer with bupivacaine than lidocaine. The increases in PI were associated with slightly higher SpHb values. We conclude that the DNB induces increases in PI and temperature of the finger. Because of the close relationship between finger temperature, PI, and SpHb, consistently increasing finger temperature and PI could increase the accuracy of SpHb.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24651230/

Whether or not the two can be considered interchangeable is controversial. Twenty-three patients undergoing spine surgery received both a 20 gauge intra-arterial catheter and a Masimo adult adhesive SpHb sensor connected to a Radical-7 monitor. Pulse pressure variation (PPV) was calculated off-line at 1-min intervals. Pleth Variability Index (PVI) and Perfusion Index data were recorded. After exclusion of outliers, agreement between PPV and PVI was assessed using a repeated measures Bland-Altman approach. Concordance between changes in PPV and PVI was assessed using a four-quadrant plot with a 20% zone of exclusion. In total, 6549 min of data were collected. Repeated measures Bland-Altman analysis identified a bias of 2.2% and 95% confidence intervals of ±15.3% (limits of agreement -13.1 and +17.6%). The concordance rate between changes in PPV and changes in PVI was 51%. The agreement between respiratory variation in the arterial blood pressure and PPG waveforms is poor and these two should not be considered interchangeable. Changes in PPV are unrelated to changes in PVI. The data, combined with recently published work from other authors, suggests that the low frequency oscillations in the PPG waveform are not related to the low frequency oscillation in the systemic arterial blood pressure tracing and may be related to changes in venous pressure, peripheral tone or other physiologic phenomena yet to be described.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23941460/

Although this system has demonstrated a high level of accuracy in average patients, the performance might be altered in special patient populations. Regarding patients with left ventricular cardiac failure, a rotary blood pump generates a constant, continuous, non-pulsatile flow to improve effective cardiac output. Due to this alteration in both, blood flow and arterial blood pressure we hypothesized a reduced accuracy of the Masimo Pronto-7® to detect Hb in patients with left ventricular cardiac failure. To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the Pronto-7®SpHb system in outpatients after continuous-flow-left ventricular assist device (cf-LVAD) implantation (HeartMate II, Thoratec).
21 cf-LVAD outpatients from the Clinic for Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery were investigated during routine follow up examinations. After venous blood samples were drawn, the Pronto-7® sensor was attached to one randomly selected finger of one hand. The collected SpHb data were compared with Hb values measured by our central laboratory. The difference between the methods was determined using Bland - Altman analysis. The study was registered in the DRKS (DRKS00004415).
In all cf-LVAD patients evaluated, the Pronto-7® successfully detected SpHb values. Using Bland - Altman analysis, a bias of 0.14 g/dl (95% upper and lower limits of agreement ± 2.76 g/dl) was calculated.
The Pronto-7® overestimated the actual Hb value in cf-LVAD outpatients with the HeartMate II. Due to this, we conclude that the system is suitable for screening in routine examinations and further analysis can be performed if needed. However, its use as an emergency tool is questionable because of the increased inaccuracy when Hb values are critically low.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23800231/

In this study, we evaluated a new acoustic ventilatory rate monitoring technology for accuracy, precision, reliability, and the ability to detect pauses in ventilation, relative to capnometry and a reference method in postsurgical patients.
Adult patients presenting to the postanesthesia care unit were connected to a Pulse CO-Oximeter with acoustic monitoring technology (Rad-87, version 7804, Masimo, Irvine, CA) through an adhesive bioacoustic sensor (RAS-125, rev C) applied to the neck. Each subject also wore a nasal cannula connected to a bedside capnometer (Capnostream20, version 4.5, Oridion, Needham, MA). The acoustic monitor and capnometer were connected to a computer for continuous acoustic and expiratory carbon dioxide waveform recordings. Recordings were retrospectively analyzed by a trained technician in a setting that allowed for the simultaneous viewing of both waveforms while listening to the breathing sounds from the acoustic signal to determine inspiration and expiration reference markers within the ventilatory cycle without using the acoustic monitor- or capnometer-calculated ventilatory rate. This allowed the automatic calculation of a reference ventilatory rate for each device through a software program (TagEditor, Masimo). Accuracy (relative to the respective reference) and precision of each device were estimated and compared with each other. Sensitivity for detection of pauses in ventilation, defined as no inspiration or expiration activity in the reference ventilatory cycle for ≥30 seconds, was also determined. The devices were also evaluated for their reliability, i.e., the percentage of the time when each displayed a value and did not drop a measurement.
Thirty-three adults (73% female) with age of 45 ± 14 years and weight 117 ± 42 kg were enrolled. A total of 3712 minutes of monitoring time (average 112 minutes per subject) were analyzed across the 2 devices, reference ventilatory rates ranged from 1.9 to 49.1 bpm. Acoustic monitoring showed significantly greater accuracy (P = 0.0056) and precision (P- = 0.0024) for respiratory rate as compared with capnometry. On average, both devices displayed data over 97% of the monitored time. The (0.95, 0.95) lower tolerance limits for the acoustic monitor and capnometer were 94% and 84%, respectively. Acoustic monitoring was marginally more sensitive (P = 0.0461) to pauses in ventilation (81% vs 62%) in 21 apneic events.
In this study of a population of postsurgical patients, the acoustic monitor and capnometer both reliably monitored ventilatory rate. The acoustic monitor was statistically more accurate and more precise than the capnometer, but differences in performance were modest. It is not known whether the observed differences are clinically significant. The acoustic monitor was more sensitive to detecting pauses in ventilation. Acoustic monitoring may provide an effective and convenient means of monitoring ventilatory rate in postsurgical patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23632055/
23302975,The use of a noninvasive hemoglobin monitor for volume kinetic analysis in an emergency room setting.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2013,"Sjöstrand F, Rodhe P, Berglund E, Lundström N, Svensen C","Distribution and clearance of an infused bolus can be studied by repetitive sampling of invasive total hemoglobin (tHb) using volume kinetic equations. Pulse CO-oximetry, a recent advancement in patient monitoring that allows for the continuous and noninvasive estimation of hemoglobin concentration (SpHb), would greatly facilitate the scientific and clinical use of the volume kinetic parameters. In the present study, we examined whether serial measurements of SpHb in an emergency room setting can be used to calculate distribution volume (V) and clearance (Cl) rate of an infused bolus.
This was a prospective, observational study of patients in 2 age groups admitted for various reasons to the emergency room of a tertiary care center. IV catheters were placed in both arms of the subjects to induce plasma volume expansion by infusion of a buffered crystalloid glucose solution and for withdrawing venous blood samples for analysis of tHb at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 minutes after start of infusion. During these interventions, subjects were simultaneously monitored by pulse CO-oximetry for measurement of SpHb (Masimo Radical-7, Rev E ReSposable Sensor). Bias, precision, and limits of agreement were calculated in Bland-Altman plots to compare the accuracy of SpHb with invasive tHb measurements. Using volume kinetic (pharmacokinetics for fluids) equations, V and Cl were determined.
Thirty patients (14 from the young group with a mean age of 30 years, and 16 from the geriatric group with mean age of 84 years) were enrolled in the study. When all data were included, this yielded 242 data pairs with a bias of -0.47 (95% confidence interval, -0.62 to -0.32) between SpHb and tHb. However, 5 patients were omitted because of low quality signals, leaving 193 hemoglobin data pairs for further analysis. Bias was then -0.24 (95% confidence interval, -0.39 to -0.09). The biases show that the device on average slightly underestimates tHb values. The precision of SpHb decreases when the low signal quality indicator is present. For the 27 subjects for whom the V and Cl were calculated, there were no significant differences in the estimation of the distribution volumes using either tHb or SpHb values. Clearance constants were also estimated, but with less accuracy.
Our data show that SpHb by pulse CO-oximetry may be used to calculate volume of distribution in an emergency room setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23302975/

A sensor combining a pulse oximeter with the Stow-Severinghaus electrode, required for the measurement of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PtcCO(2)), respectively, has been recently used in neonatal clinical practice (TOSCA(500Ò)Radiometer). We evaluated TOSCA usability and reliability in the delivery room (DR), throughout three different periods, on term, late-preterm, and preterm neonates. During the first period (period A), 30 healthy term neonates were simultaneously monitored with both TOSCA and a MASIMO pulse oximeter. During the second period (period B), 10 healthy late-preterm neonates were monitored with both TOSCA and a transcutaneous device measuring PtcCO(2) (TINA(Ò) TCM3, Radiometer). During the third period (period C), 15 preterm neonates were monitored with TOSCA and MASIMO after birth, during stabilization, and during transport to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Blood gas analyses were performed to compare transcutaneous and blood gas values. TOSCA resulted easily and safely usable in the DR, allowing reliable noninvasive SaO(2) estimation. Since PtcCO(2) measurements with TOSCA required at least 10 min to be stable and reliable, this parameter was not useful during the early resuscitation immediately after birth. Moreover, PtcCO(2) levels were less precise if compared to the conventional transcutaneous monitoring. However, PtcCO(2) measurement by TOSCA was useful as trend-monitoring after stabilization and during transport to NICU.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112642/

Accurate assessment of the concentration of hemoglobin [Hgb] is a key component of this evaluation. Recently a noninvasive method of continuously measuring hemoglobin (SpHb) has become available with multi-wavelength Pulse CO-Oximetry. The accuracy of this device is well documented, but the trending ability of this monitor has not been previously described. Twenty patients undergoing major thoracic and lumbar spine surgery were recruited. All patients received radial arterial lines. On the contralateral index finger, a R1 25 sensor (Rev E) was applied and connected to a Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter (both Masimo Corp, Irvine, CA). Blood samples were drawn intermittently at the anesthesia provider's discretion and were analyzed by the operating room satellite laboratory CO-Oximeter. The value of Hgb and SpHb at that time point was compared. Trend analysis was performed by the four quadrant plot technique, testing directionality of change, and Critchley's polar plot method testing both directionality and magnitude of the change in values. Eighty-eight samples recorded at times of sufficient signal quality were available for analysis. Four quadrant plot analysis revealed 94% of data within the quadrants associated with the correct direction change, and 90% of data points lay within the analysis bounds proposed by Critchley.

Continuous hemoglobin measurement by pulse cooximetry (pulse hemoglobin; Rainbow® SET Pulse CO-Oximeter, Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA) has good agreement with laboratory hemoglobin in healthy volunteers and could aid transfusion decision-making. Because intraoperative physiology may alter performance of this device, this study investigated pulse hemoglobin during surgery.
Ninety-one adult patients undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery in which large blood loss was likely were studied. Time-matched pulse hemoglobin measurements were recorded for each intraoperative arterial hemoglobin measurement obtained. Agreement between measurements was assessed by average difference (mean ± SD, g/dl), linear regression, and multiple measures Bland-Altman analysis.
The average difference between 360 time-matched measurements (bias) was 0.50 ± 1.44 g/dl, with wider limits of agreement (-2.3 to 3.3 g/dl) than reported in healthy volunteers. The average difference between 269 paired sequential pulse and arterial hemoglobin changes was 0.10 ± 1.11 g/dl, with half between -0.6 and 0.7 g/dl of each other. The bias was larger in patients with blood loss of more than 1,000 ml; hemoglobin less than 9.0 g/dl; any intraoperative transfusion; or intraoperative decrease in arterial hemoglobin at the time of sampling ≥2 g/dl (all P < 0.001). The range of bias was narrower at deeper anesthesia (P < 0.001).

Currently, Hb can be determined invasively by analyzing blood via laboratory Co-Oximetry (tHb) or by point-of-care HemoCue (HCue). Recently, a new noninvasive, continuous spectrophotometric sensor (Masimo SpHb) was introduced into clinical practice. We compared the accuracy of the SpHb and HCue with tHb.
Twenty patients, ages 40 to 80 years, were studied. They received general anesthesia and underwent spine surgery in the prone position. All blood samples were obtained from a radial artery catheter. SpHb, tHb, and HCue were determined immediately after induction of anesthesia, but before the start of surgery and approximately every hour thereafter. Primary outcomes were defined on the basis of the following differences between measures: SpHb - tHb or HCue - tHb. All patients had 3 to 5 observations taken on each measure. Differences and absolute differences were analyzed by several techniques to assess accuracy. We also investigated the relationship between observed differences and the following variables: tHb level, duration of surgery, age, weight, and perfusion index.
Data consisted of 78 measurements of SpHb, tHb, and HCue made on the 20 patients. Absolute differences between SpHb and tHb were <1.5 g/dL for 61% of observations, between 1.6 to 2.0 g/dL for 16% and >2.0 g/dL for 22% of the observations. Observed differences displayed significant decreases with time and higher perfusion index values. No systematic relationships were observed with age or weight. Except for 1 value, all of the HCue values were <1.0 g/dL of tHb.
Although HCue was consistently accurate, our data confirm that SpHb often correlated well with tHb values. Yet our study indicates that SpHb may not be as accurate as clinically necessary in some patients.

Members of the research team placed the sensors for each of the pulse oximeters being compared simultaneously, one sensor on each foot of the same baby. Care provided routinely, without interference by the research team. The time elapsed until a reliable SpO2 was obtained was recorded using a digital chronometer. Statistical comparisons included chi-square and student's T-test.
Thirty-two infants were enrolled; median gestational age 32 weeks. Seventeen paired measurements were made with the Radical-7 and Biox 3700; mean time to a stable reading was 20.2±7 sec for the Radical-7 and 74.2±12 sec for the Biox 3700 (p=0.02).

The usefulness of the Signal Extraction Technology (SET) in these situations has not yet been investigated.
Twenty-five adult patients requiring norepinephrine, regardless of the reason or dosage, or having a defective signal with a conventional oximeter were equipped with both their conventional saturation sensor (Oxymax Nellcor) and a SET saturation sensor (Masimo) connected to its monitor. Saturation values displayed by each pulse oximeter and the SaO(2) measured concomitantly by cooximetry were gathered on inclusion and then whenever one of the two sensors did not display a value, or when the difference between the values was greater than five saturation points, or at any time a blood gas analysis was done.
During the study period, 83 measures were collected. Using the Bland and Altman method, SaO(2) estimates by the SET system were more accurate than those by the conventional system (bias+/-2 S.D. of 0.0%+/-3.1% vs 2.1%+/-11.0%, respectively), even when only valid values (values accompanied by a satisfactory quality index) were considered (0.0%+/-2.7% vs 1.2%+/-7.0%).
In situations at risk of producing defective signals when using conventional sensors, the SET system provided more valid SaO(2) estimates.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19595560/
18048893,Dark skin decreases the accuracy of pulse oximeters at low oxygen saturation: the effects of oximeter probe type and gender.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2007,"Feiner JR, Severinghaus JW, Bickler PE","Pulse oximetry may overestimate arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (Sao2) at low Sao2 levels in individuals with darkly pigmented skin, but other factors, such as gender and oximeter probe type, remain less studied.
We studied the relationship between skin pigment and oximeter accuracy in 36 subjects (19 males, 17 females) of a range of skin tones. Clip-on type sensors and adhesive/disposable finger probes for the Masimo Radical, Nellcor N-595, and Nonin 9700 were studied. Semisupine subjects breathed air-nitrogen-CO2 mixtures via a mouthpiece to rapidly achieve 2- to 3-min stable plateaus of Sao2. Comparisons of Sao2 measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) with Sao2 (by Radiometer OSM-3) were used in a multivariate model to assess the source of errors.
The mean bias (Spo2 - Sao2) for the 70%-80% saturation range was 2.61% for the Masimo Radical with clip-on sensor, -1.58% for the Radical with disposable sensor, 2.59% for the Nellcor clip, 3.6% for the Nellcor disposable, -0.60% for the Nonin clip, and 2.43% for the Nonin disposable. Dark skin increased bias at low Sao2; greater bias was seen with adhesive/disposable sensors than with the clip-on types. Up to 10% differences in saturation estimates were found among different instruments in dark-skinned subjects at low Sao2.
Multivariate analysis indicated that Sao2 level, sensor type, skin color, and gender were predictive of errors in Spo2 estimates at low Sao2 levels. The data suggest that clinically important bias should be considered when monitoring patients with saturations below 80%, especially those with darkly pigmented skin; but further study is needed to confirm these observations in the relevant populations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18048893/
15362268,Performance of a digital PCO2/SPO2 ear sensor.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2004,"Kocher S, Rohling R, Tschupp A","For determining the adequacy of ventilation, conventional pulse oximetry should be amended by PaCO2 (= arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure). This study investigates the precision of carbon dioxide measurements of the first digital ear-clip sensor providing continuous non-invasive monitoring of PaCO2, SpO2 (= functional arterial oxygen saturation as estimated with a pulse oximeter) and pulse rate and compares it to two conventional analog oximeters.
30 hypoxemia episodes in 6 adult volunteers were investigated in a standardized protocol.
Masimo analog finger sensor, Nellcor analog ear sensor, SenTec digital ear sensor.
The difference between PCO2 data (= PaCO2 estimated from the measured PcCO2 based on an algorithm by Severinghaus) (PcCO2 = cutaneous carbon dioxide pressure) and the PaCO2 is clinically unimportant. Therefore, we suggest, the two methods of estimating patient's carbon dioxide status can be used interchangeably.
Combined digital SpO2/ PcCO2 ear sensors are very promising to allow for a fast and reliable monitoring of patient's oxygenation, hyper-/hypocapnia and ventilation with one single non-invasive probe. Optimal primary signal processing--amplification and digitalisation within the probe--allow for fast and reliable downstream signal processing algorithms. The resulting short SpO2 response times give the medical staff more time to take appropriate actions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15362268/

In the present study, we compared the failure times of pulse oximeters during cuff-induced hypoperfusion in volunteers. A pulse oximeter sensor was attached to the index finger, and a blood pressure cuff was attached to the same arm of each volunteer. MasimoSET Radical (Masimo), Nellcor N-395 (N-395), Nellcor N-20PA, and Nellcor D-25 were tested. To evaluate the failure time of each pulse oximeter, time to peak of cuff pressure, time to loss of signal, time to recovery of signal, and failure interval were measured. All measurements were performed three times for each pulse oximeter and were averaged. There were no differences in hemodynamic measurements among the groups. Time to loss of signal was longer in Masimo than the other pulse oximeters. Masimo and N-395 showed significantly shorter times to recovery of signal than those of the other two pulse oximeters. Failure interval was in the order of Masimo << N-395 < Nellcor D-25 = Nellcor N-20PA. Masimo did not lose a signal as rapidly as the other oximeters studied. Masimo was similar in performance to the N-395 at providing useful data sooner than conventional technology after a loss of the signal. These observations suggest that data will be more available with fewer false-positive alarms when using the Masimo oximeter followed by the N-395 when compared with conventional oximeters.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15333413/
12673263,Longevity of Masimo and Nellcor pulse oximeter sensors in the care of infants.,Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,2003,"Erler T, Avenarius S, Wischniewski E, Schmidt K, Kläber HG","Pulse oximetry is a standard of care for monitoring oxygenation in neonates. Associated with the use of pulse oximetry is the cost of patient sensors, especially if the sensor is designed for single-patient use. Pulse oximetry monitoring of sick newborns is routine and often lengthy and, if the pulse oximeter sensor is short-lived, can result in a significant portion in the cost of intensive care.
We evaluated, in the NICUs of two hospitals and one step-down nursery, the useful life of disposable neonatal pulse oximeter sensors from two manufacturers: Masimo and Nellcor. The only requisites were ethics committee approval and need for monitoring. The timed of PO sensor placement and replacement were noted along with the reason for changing the sensor. The standard care practices for PO and sensor use in the respective institutions were followed.
A total of 835.5 patient days of monitoring were accumulated with 65 infants in the Masimo group and 56 using Nellcor. The Masimo Neo sensors had over twice (2.33) the useful life of the Nellcor N-25 (9.05+/-4.4 versus 3.9+/-2.3 days (range of 7.2-11.8 and 2.5-5.8 days, respectively, p<0.05)). The magnitude of useful life between the two institutions was not significantly different in the Masimo group (2.35- versus 2.22-fold). PO sensors were replaced due to impaired adhesion (38 Masimo and 32 Nellcor) and no signal (six Masimo and four Nellcor).
We found a more than two-fold increase in the life of Masimo versus Nellcor sensors. This difference was consistent between various caregivers in multiple settings and corroborates the experience of another, more limited study. A cost savings should result from the use of Masimo versus Nellcor disposable pulse oximeter sensors in neonatal routine care",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12673263/

New pulse oximeter technology addresses these issues and may offer improved performance. We simultaneously compared Nellcor N-395 (Oxismart XLTM) pulse oximeters with an RS-10 forehead sensor (RS-10), a D-25 digit sensor (D-25), and the Ivy 2000 (Masimo SETTM)/LNOP-Adt digit sensor (Ivy) to arterial blood oxygen saturation (Sa(O(2))) by cooximetry. Nine normal subjects, six athletes, and four patients with chronic disease exercised to maximum oxygen consumption (VO(2 max)) under various conditions [normoxia, hypoxia inspired oxygen fraction (FI(O(2))) = 0.125; hyperoxia, FI(O(2)) = 1.0]. Regression analysis for normoxia and hypoxic data was performed (n = 161 observations, Sa(O(2)) = 73-99.9%), and bias (B) and precision (P) were calculated. RS10 offered greater validity than the other two devices tested (y = 1.009x - 0.52, R(2) = 0.90, B+/-P = 0.3 +/- 2.5). Finger sensors had low precision and a significant negative bias (D-25: y = 1.004x - 2.327, R(2) = 0.52, B+/-P = -2.0 +/- 7.3; Ivy: y = 1.237x - 24.2, R(2) = 0.78, B+/-P = -2.0 +/- 5.2). Eliminating measurements in which heart rate differed by >10 beats/min from the electrocardiogram value improved precision minimally and did not affect bias substantially (B+/-P = 0.5 +/- 2.0, -1.8 +/- 8.4, and -1.25+/-4.33 for RS-10, D-25, and Ivy, respectively). Signal detection algorithms and pulse oximeter were identical between RS-10 and D-25; thus the improved performance of the forehead sensor is likely because of sensor location. RS-10 should be considered for exercise testing in which pulse oximetry is desirable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11744656/
11094776,Next-generation pulse oximetry. Focusing on Masimo's signal extraction technology.,Health devices,2000,,"Pulse oximeters are used to determine trends in patients' blood oxygen saturation and to warn of dangerous saturation levels. But conventional pulse oximetry has some inherent limitations. For example, it has difficulty monitoring patients who are moving or who have poor perfusion; it is also subject to interference from certain visible and infrared light sources. Over the past several years, a number of companies have developed advanced signal-processing techniques that allow pulse oximeters to overcome many of these limitations. We refer to such new technologies as next-generation pulse oximetry. In this Evaluation, we focus on the first next-generation technology to have reached the market: Masimo Corporation's Signal Extraction Technology (SET). We designed our study of Masimo SET to address the main question that needs to be asked of any next-generation technology: How well does it compare to conventional pulse oximetry? Specifically, how well does it perform when a patient is moving or being moved, when a patient is poorly perfused, or when certain types of light strike the sensor while it is attached to or detached from the patient? We also examined one type of sensor used with this product, comparing it to conventional tape-on sensors for comfort and durability. Several other next-generation pulse-oximeter products have become available since we began this study. We are currently evaluating these products and will publish our findings in the near future. A list of the products, including a brief description of each, is included in this article. Pulse oximeters are used to determine trends in patients' blood oxygen saturation and to warn against dangerous saturation levels. These monitors are often vital in helping to ensure patient safety, especially for critically ill patients, pediatric patients, and neonates. But conventional pulse oximetry has some inherent limitations--most significantly, it has difficulty monitoring patients who are moving or who have poor perfusion. Although gradual improvements have been made to the technology, only recently has it advanced to the point where it has really begun to overcome these limitations. A number of manufacturers have developed advanced signal-processing algorithms that allow pulse oximeters to ""read through"" motion and conditions of poor perfusion. The first of these ""next-generation"" pulse-oximeter technologies that reached the market was Masimo Corporation's Signal Extraction Technology (SET). We tested that product in this Evaluation. In this Overview, we'll tell you about conventional pulse oximetry and its shortfalls, next-generation technology and how it's designed to improve on the old methods, and how we approached our Evaluation of Masimo SET.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11094776/

Pulse oximeters may fail to provide valid SpO2 data in various situations that produce low signal-to-noise ratio. Motion artifact is a common cause of oximeter failure and loss of accuracy. This study compares the accuracy and data dropout rates of three current pulse oximeters during standardized motion in healthy volunteers.
Ten healthy volunteers were monitored by three different pulse oximeters: Nellcor N-200, Nellcor N-3000, and Masimo SET (prototype). Sensors were placed on digits 2, 3, and 4 of the test hand, which was strapped to a mechanical motion table. The opposite hand was used as a stationary control and was monitored with the same pulse oximeters and an arterial cannula. Arterial oxygen saturation was varied from 100% to 75% by changing the inspired oxygen concentration. While SpO2 was both constant and changing, the oximeter sensors were connected before and during motion. Oximeter errors and dropout rates were digitally recorded continuously during each experiment.
If the oximeter was functioning before motion began, the following are the percentages of time when the instrument displayed an SpO2 value within 7% of control: N-200 = 76%, N-3000 = 87%, and Masimo = 99%. When the oximeter sensor was connected after the beginning of motion, the values were N-200 = 68%, N-3000 = 47%, and Masimo = 97%. If the alarm threshold was chosen SpO2 less than 90%, then the positive predictive values (true alarms/total alarms) are N-200 = 73%, N-3000 = 81%, and Masimo = 100%. In general, N-200 had the greatest SpO2 errors and N-3000 had the highest dropout rates.
The mechanical motions used in this study significantly affected oximeter function, particularly when the sensors were connected during motion, which requires signal acquisition during motion. The error and dropout rate performance of the Masimo was superior to that of the other two instruments during all test conditions. Masimo uses a new paradigm for oximeter signal processing, which appears to represent a significant advance in low signal-to-noise performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9009945/
