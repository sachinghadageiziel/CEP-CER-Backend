41249938,Comparison of bispectral index and patient state index during general anesthesia with remimazolam.,BMC anesthesiology,2025,"Shiraishi T, Yahagi M, Yoshida M, Yawata M, Kurokawa H, Tamakawa Y, Kawakita Y, Yaguchi Y","Processed electroencephalographic indices, such as the Bispectral Index (BIS) and Patient State Index (PSI), are widely used to assess anesthetic depth; however, their comparative behavior under remimazolam remains unclear. In practice, either index may deviate from its target range despite stable anesthesia, and the response of the companion monitor is uncertain. This study examined whether the two indices moved in parallel or diverged when one departed from its nominal range during remimazolam anesthesia.
In this prospective, single-center study, BIS and PSI were simultaneously recorded at 21 predefined time points from induction to emergence in 60 adults who received remimazolam-based general anesthesia. Remimazolam was induced at 12 mg/kg/h and maintained at 1 mg/kg/h; all patients received neuromuscular blockade (train-of-four ≤ 1). Two trained observers captured synchronized monitor screenshots and documented the Signal Quality Index, electromyography (EMG), and suppression ratio. Analyses used 994 paired observations: pooled Pearson and repeated-measures correlations, simple linear regression (PSI vs. BIS), repeated-measures Bland-Altman analysis, and a linear mixed-effects model for BIS-PSI differences, including anesthetic phase and EMG as fixed effects and patient as a random intercept.
BIS and PSI showed a strong correlation (r = 0.89) and linear relationship (PSI = 0.936 × BIS - 7.26; R² = 0.79). The repeated-measures Bland-Altman bias was + 10.9 (95% CI 10.3-11.4) with 95% limit of agreement (LoA) - 7.8 to 29.5. Phase-wise modeling showed minimal discrepancies while awake and larger differences during intubation and emergence (Tukey-adjusted p < 0.001), even after EMG adjustment. Both indices tracked the anesthetic depth in parallel but were not numerically interchangeable.
During remimazolam anesthesia, BIS and PSI exhibited parallel temporal trends, indicating shared cortical dynamics despite distinct algorithms. When either index deviated, either elevated or suppressed, the other generally moved in the same direction, reflecting consistent responsiveness rather than device artifacts. Phase-dependent discrepancies and wide agreement limits suggest that each index should be interpreted within its reference framework. Understanding this ""parallel yet nonidentical"" behavior may support context-aware, device-specific depth monitoring.

39723638,Electroencephalography and Anesthetic Depth in Children Under 2 Years of Age: A Prospective Observational Study.,Paediatric anaesthesia,2025,"Yoon SB, Park JB, Kang P, Jang YE, Kim EH, Lee JH, Lee HC, Kim JT, Kim HS, Ji SH","Processed electroencephalogram (EEG) indices are widely used to monitor anesthetic depth. However, their reliability in children under 2 years of age remains questionable. During anesthesia maintenance in this age group, processed EEG indices frequently exhibit unexpectedly elevated values that exceed the intended target range.
This study aimed to identify EEG spectral parameters associated with false positive elevations in processed EEG indices and investigate their differences from true positive elevations during emergence.
This prospective observational study included 50 children aged 4-24 months undergoing general anesthesia. Bispectral index (BIS), patient state index (PSi), and raw EEG were continuously recorded throughout anesthesia. False positive was defined as elevated processed EEG indices when end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was maintained at 0.7-1.3 minimum alveolar concentration, with heart rate and mean blood pressure between 80% and 120% of baseline values. We analyzed EEG power spectra and band power values during periods of false positives and compared them with those of true positives during emergence. Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05 was considered significant.
False positives in processed EEG indices were observed in 35 (70%) of the children during anesthesia maintenance, occupying 28% of the maintenance phase. These false positives were associated with decreased power in delta (269-174 dB) and theta (115-97 dB) bands, but widespread increases in alpha and beta bands, resulting in elevated spectral edge frequency (19-22 Hz). Notably, EEG band power during false positives significantly differed from those observed during emergence (delta: 52 dB, theta: 38 dB) (all p < 0.001).
Processed EEG indices may exhibit unexpectedly elevated values during anesthesia maintenance in children under 2 years of age. Quantitative assessments derived from raw EEG data may improve the evaluation of anesthetic depth in this population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39723638/

This study aimed to evaluate the association between the effect-site concentration of ketamine (CeK) and 2 electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived parameters, the BIS and spectral edge frequency (SEF 95 ), after the administration of a ketamine bolus. Secondary aims included investigating the BIS and SEF 95 variations with time and changes in the surgical pleth index (SPI).
We conducted an observational, prospective, single-center study analyzing intraoperative data from 14 adult female patients undergoing breast oncologic surgery. During stable propofol-remifentanil target-controlled infusion (TCI) anesthesia, a ketamine analgesic bolus was delivered with the target CeK set to 1 μg.mL -1 (Domino model) corresponding to a dose of 0.57 mg.kg -1 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.56-0.57 mg.kg -1 ). Once the CeK reached a value of 1 μg.mL -1 , the target CeK was set to 0 μg.mL -1 . We determined the median BIS, SEF 95 , and SPI trends with time and as a function of the modeled CeK.
BIS and SEF 95 showed no significant change from when ketamine was administered to when CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , but a significant increase was observed at lower CeKs. The maximum BIS was reached at 16.0 minutes [10.2-22.7 minutes] after CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , at CeK=0.22 μg.mL -1 [0.12-0.41 μg.mL -1 ]. The peak SEF 95 value was observed at 10.0 minutes [8.62-14.1 minutes] after CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , at CeK=0.43 μg.mL -1 [0.25-0.50 μg.mL -1 ]. No significant association was found between CeK and the registered SPI values.
Our results show that BIS and SEF 95 , but not SPI, follow a CeK-dependent trend after administering a ketamine bolus. Interestingly, their peak values were not reached at CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , but after several minutes after the drug infusion at CeKs in the 0.2 to 0.5 μg.mL -1 range. This may be explained by the specific pharmacodynamics of ketamine and its varying effects at different concentrations, as well as by the time delay associated with the calculation of the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39485729/

38114941,Comparison of post-auricular and frontal bispectral index values obtained during renal surgeries.,BMC anesthesiology,2023,"Abdelrahman AMF, Elbadry AA, Omara AF","The bispectral index (BIS) monitor is one of the EEG-derived monitoring techniques and well-established devices used to measure the depth of anesthesia. This study aimed to assess the agreement of BIS values based on the positions of either post-auricular or frontal sensors in individual patients undergoing renal surgeries while lateral positions at various stages of anesthesia.
12 patients older than 18 years, ASA I-III patients scheduled for elective renal operations, two BIS were placed on each patient, one on each side of the post-auricular region and one across the forehead, and each sensor was connected to a different BIS monitor. We gathered three pieces of data at each of the six-time points: BIS score, signal quality index (SQI) score calculating the signal's strength and electromyography (EMG) score: before the onset of anesthesia (awake) when the eyelash reflex is lost (LOC), after intubation (intubation), following the initial surgical incision, each 30 min throughout the procedure (maintenance), and at the moment the patient's eyes open naturally after waking up from anesthesia (emergence).
The overall BIS value at the frontal position was significantly higher than the post-auricular position (52.5 ± 22.2 and 52.1 ± 22.1, respectively, P = 0.010). On the other hand, the BIS value was comparable between the frontal and post-auricular positions at LOC, intubation, 60, 120, and 80 min and at emergence. A strong link between the two sensor positions, as indicated by the correlation coefficient (r = 0.607, P < 0.001), and the Bland-Altman analysis revealed a small mean difference (-1.8) and a low (9.0/- 12.5) limit of agreement, with just 4.3% of the readings falling outside of it during the anesthetic maintenance period.
Acceptable variation in BIS data was observed when obtained from the two different sensor positions for clinical usage. The post-auricular BIS sensor system may be a suitable substitute for an impractical frontal setup.

We investigated the correlation of the electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters with the effect-site remimazolam concentration and the depth of sedation in patients receiving a target-controlled infusion of remimazolam.
This prospective observational study enrolled 35 patients (32 analyzed) who underwent lower extremity varicose vein surgery or lower extremity orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia. We administered remimazolam by target-controlled infusion using the pharmacokinetic model introduced by Schüttler et al. The EEG data were continuously recorded, including the bispectral index (BIS), patient state index (PSI), spectral edge frequency (SEF), and raw EEG signals. The relative beta ratio (RBR), defined as log (spectral power [30-47 Hz]/spectral power [11-20 Hz]), was obtained by analyzing raw EEG. The level of sedation corresponding to each effect-site remimazolam concentration was assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S). The prediction probability (Pk) and Spearman's correlation coefficients (R) were calculated between effect-site remimazolam concentration, MOAA/S, and EEG parameters.
BIS and PSI showed significantly higher Pk for effect-site remimazolam concentration (Pk = 0.76 [0.72-0.79], P < .001 for BIS; Pk = 0.76 [0.73-0.79], P < .001 for PSI) compared to RBR (Pk = 0.71 [0.68-0.74], P < .001) and SEF (Pk = 0.58 [0.53-0.63], P = .002). BIS, PSI, and RBR showed significantly higher correlation coefficients for effect-site remimazolam concentration (R = -0.70 [-0.78 to -0.63], P < .001 for BIS; R = -0.72 [-0.79 to -0.66], P < .001 for PSI; R = -0.61 [-0.69 to -0.54], P < .001 for RBR) compared to SEF (R = -0.22 [-0.36 to -0.08], P = .002). BIS and PSI also had significantly higher Pk and correlation coefficients for MOAA/S (Pk = 0.81 [0.79-0.83], P < .001; R = 0.84 [0.81-0.88], P < .001 for BIS) (Pk = 0.80 [0.78-0.83], P < .001; R = 0.82 [0.78-0.87], P < .001 for PSI) compared to RBR (Pk = 0.74 [0.72-0.77], P < .001; R = 0.72 [0.65-0.78], P < .001) and SEF (Pk = 0.55 [0.50-0.59], P = .041; R = 0.13 [-0.01 to 0.27], P = .067).
BIS, PSI, and RBR showed an acceptable correlation with the effect-site remimazolam concentration and depth of sedation in this study, suggesting that these EEG-derived parameters are potentially reliable hypnotic indicators during remimazolam sedation. BIS and PSI showed superior performance as hypnotic indicators to RBR and SEF in patients receiving target-controlled infusion of remimazolam.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38051672/

37059989,Time-trend analysis of the center frequency of the intrinsic mode function from the Hilbert-Huang transform of electroencephalography during general anesthesia: a retrospective observational study.,BMC anesthesiology,2023,"Obata Y, Yamada T, Akiyama K, Sawa T","Anesthesiologists are required to maintain an optimal depth of anesthesia during general anesthesia, and several electroencephalogram (EEG) processing methods have been developed and approved for clinical use to evaluate anesthesia depth. Recently, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) was introduced to analyze nonlinear and nonstationary data. In this study, we assessed whether the changes in EEG characteristics during general anesthesia that are analyzed by the HHT are useful for monitoring the depth of anesthesia.
This retrospective observational study enrolled patients who underwent propofol anesthesia. Raw EEG signals were obtained from a monitor through a previously developed software application. We developed an HHT analyzer to decompose the EEG signal into six intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and estimated the instantaneous frequencies (HHT_IF) for each IMF. Changes over time in the raw EEG waves and parameters such as HHT_IF, BIS, spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), and electromyogram parameter (EMGlow) were assessed, and a Gaussian process regression model was created to assess the association between BIS and HHT_IF.
We analyzed EEG signals from 30 patients. The beta oscillation frequency range (13-25 Hz) was detected in IMF1 and IMF2 during the awake state, then after loss of consciousness, the frequency decreased and alpha oscillation (8-12 Hz) was detected in IMF2. At the emergence phase, the frequency increased and beta oscillations were detected in IMF1, IMF2, and IMF3. BIS and EMGlow changed significantly during the induction and emergence phases, whereas SEF95 showed a wide variability and no significant changes during the induction phase. The root mean square error between the observed BIS values and the values predicted by a Gaussian process regression model ranged from 4.69 to 9.68.
We applied the HHT to EEG analyses during propofol anesthesia. The instantaneous frequency in IMF1 and IMF2 identified changes in EEG characteristics during induction and emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, the HHT_IF in IMF2 showed strong associations with BIS and was suitable for depicting the alpha oscillation. Our study suggests that the HHT is useful for monitoring the depth of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37059989/

While many studies have assessed the response of these markers to propofol sedation and anesthetic gases, few studies have compared these markers when using dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist. Fifty-one patients underwent drug induced sleep endoscopy with dexmedetomidine sedation. Continuous EEG was captured using SedLine (Masimo, Inc), and a playback system was used to extract the bispectral index (BIS) (Medtronic Inc), the patient state index (PSI) (Masimo, Inc), the state and response Entropy (GE Healthcare), and calculate the spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF95). Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores were assessed continually throughout the procedure and in recovery. We assessed the correlation between EEG markers and constructed ordinal logistic regression models to predict the RASS score and compare EEG markers. All three commercial EEG metrics were significantly associated with the RASS score (p < 0.001 for all metrics) whereas SEF95 alone was insufficient at characterizing dexmedetomidine sedation. PSI and Entropy achieved higher accuracy at predicing deeper levels of sedation as compared to BIS (PSI: 58.3%, Entropy: 58.3%, BIS: 44.4%). Lightening secondary to RASS score assessment is significantly captured by all three commercial EEG metrics (p < 0.001). Commercial EEG monitors can capture changes in the brain state associated with the RASS score during dexmedetomidine sedation. PSI and Entropy were highly correlated and may be better suited for assessing deeper levels of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36550344/

The primary aim of the study was to compare the response of the Bispectral Index (BIS) during emergence from anesthesia maintained by xenon and sevoflurane. To better understand the variation in response of pEEG to these agents, we also compared several EEG derived parameters relevant to pEEG monitoring during emergence. Twenty-four participants scheduled for lithotripsy were randomized to receive xenon or sevoflurane anesthesia. Participants were monitored with the BIS and had simultaneous raw EEG collected. BIS index values were compared at three key emergence timepoints: first response, eyes open and removal of airway. Two sets of EEG derived parameters, three related to the BIS: relative beta ratio, SynchFastSlow and SynchFastSlow biocoherence, and two unrelated to the BIS: spectral edge frequency and the composite cortical state, were calculated for comparison. BIS index values were significantly lower in the xenon group than the sevoflurane group at each emergence timepoint. The relative beta ratio parameter increased significantly during emergence in the sevoflurane group but not in the xenon group. The spectral edge frequency and composite cortical state parameters increased significantly in both groups during emergence. The BIS index is lower at equivalent stages of behavioural response during emergence from xenon anesthesia when compared to sevoflurane anesthesia, most likely due to differences in how these two agents influence the relative beta ratio.

In this study, the level of sedation during general anesthesia with remimazolam was evaluated using several different indicators.
Thirty patients who underwent breast surgery under general anesthesia with remimazolam were included. BIS®, Sedline® and the pupil resting diameters were measured simultaneously. The intraoperative dose of remimazolam was adjusted to obtain a BIS in the range of 40-60; if a BIS < 60 could not be achieved, the intraoperative dose was increased up to the maximal dose of 2 mg/kg/h.
The mean intraoperative BIS and patient state index (PSI) in all patients was 50.6 ± 9.1 and 43.0 ± 11.8, respectively. Five patients showed a mean intraoperative BIS > 60 and eight patients showed mean intraoperative PSI > 50.

This indicates that there is an urgent need to moderate the level of anesthesia. Recently deep learning (DL) methods have played a major role in estimating the depth of Anesthesia (DOA) of patients and has played an essential role in control anesthesia overdose. In this paper, Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been used for the prediction of DOA. EEG signals are very complex signals which may require months of training and advanced signal processing techniques. It is a point of debate whether DL methods are an improvement over the already existing traditional EEG signal processing approaches. One of the DL algorithms is Convolutional neural network (CNN) which is very popular algorithm for object recognition and is widely growing its applications in processing hierarchy in the human visual system. In this paper, various decomposition methods have been used for extracting the features EEG signal. After acquiring the necessary signals values in image format, several CNN models have been deployed for classification of DOA depending upon their Bispectral Index (BIS) and the signal quality index (SQI). The EEG signals were converted into the frequency domain using and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). However, because of the inter mode mixing observed in EMD method; EEMD have been utilized for this study. The developed CNN models were used to predict the DOA based on the EEG spectrum images without the use of handcrafted features which provides intuitive mapping with high efficiency and reliability. The best trained model gives an accuracy of 83.2%. Hence, this provides further scope and research which can be carried out in the domain of visual mapping of DOA using EEG signals and DL methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34517477/

In patients with electroencephalography-confirmed seizures, the mean value and trend (slope of linear regression) of bilateral BIS monitor parameters were analyzed from 1 minute before to 1 minute after seizure onset.
Of 48 patients included in the study, 21 (43.8%) had at least 1 seizure. BIS numerical value was not able to detect focal or focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Considering all seizures, the only significant differences between recordings 1 minute before and 1 minute after seizure onset were a decrease in the signal quality index slope from 1 hemisphere (0.039±0.297 vs. -0.085±0.321, respectively; P =0.029) and in the mean signal quality index recorded from both hemispheres (left hemisphere: 65.775±30.599 vs. 61.032±26.285; P =0.016 and right hemisphere: 63.244±31.985 vs. 59.837±27.360; 0.029); these differences were not maintained after Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons. In seizures occurring during sleep, there was a change in the electromyography slope of 1 hemisphere before and after seizure onset (-0.141±0.176 vs. 0.162±0.140, respectively; P =0.038). There were variable responses in BIS parameters in the 3 patients who developed focal nonconvulsive seizure clusters.
Bilateral BIS monitoring was not able to detect the occurrence of seizures in epileptic patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34091549/
33975095,The influence of age on EEG-based anaesthesia indices.,Journal of clinical anesthesia,2021,"Obert DP, Schweizer C, Zinn S, Kratzer S, Hight D, Sleigh J, Schneider G, García PS, Kreuzer M","In the upcoming years there will be a growing number of elderly patients requiring general anaesthesia. As age is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD) the incidence of POD will increase concordantly. One approach to reduce the risk of POD would be to avoid excessively high doses of anaesthetics by using neuromonitoring to guide anaesthesia titration. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of patient's age on various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based anaesthesia indices.
We conducted an analysis of previously published data by replaying single electrode EEG episodes of maintenance of general anaesthesia from 180 patients (18-90 years; ASA I-IV) into the five different commercially available monitoring systems and evaluated their indices. We included the State/Response Entropy, Narcotrend, qCON/qNOX, bispectral index (BIS), and Treaton MGA-06. For a non-commercial comparison, we extracted the spectral edge frequency (SEF) from the BIS. To evaluate the influence of the age we generated linear regression models. We also assessed the correlation between the various indices.
During anaesthetic maintenance the values of the SEF, State/Response Entropy, qCON/qNOX and BIS all significantly increased (0.05 Hz/0.19-0.26 index points per year) with the patient's age (p < 0.001); whereas the Narcotrend did not change significantly with age (0.06 index points per year; p = 0.28). The index values of the Treaton device significantly decreased with age (-0.09 index points per year; p < 0.001). These findings were independent of the administered dose of anaesthetics.
Almost all current neuromonitoring devices are influenced by age, with the potential to result in inappropriately high dosage of anaesthetics. Therefore, anaesthesiologists should be aware of this phenomenon, and the next generation of monitors should correct for these changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33975095/

33093360,A Forensic Disassembly of the BIS Monitor.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2020,Connor CW,"The bispectral index (BIS) monitor has been available for clinical use for >20 years and has had an immense impact on academic activity in Anesthesiology, with >3000 articles referencing the bispectral index. Despite attempts to infer its algorithms by external observation, its operation has nevertheless remained undescribed, in contrast to the algorithms of other less commercially successful monitors of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity under anesthesia. With the expiration of certain key patents, the time is therefore ripe to examine the operation of the monitor on its own terms through careful dismantling, followed by extraction and examination of its internal software.
An A-2000 BIS Monitor (gunmetal blue case, amber monochrome display) was purchased on the secondary market. After identifying the major data processing and storage components, a set of free or inexpensive tools was used to retrieve and disassemble the monitor's onboard software. The software executes primarily on an ARMv7 microprocessor (Sharp/NXP LH77790B) and a digital signal processor (Texas Instruments TMS320C32). The device software can be retrieved directly from the monitor's hardware by using debugging interfaces that have remained in place from its original development.
Critical numerical parameters such as the spectral edge frequency (SEF), total power, and BIS values were retraced from external delivery at the device's serial port back to the point of their calculation in the extracted software. In doing so, the locations of the critical algorithms were determined. To demonstrate the validity of the technique, the algorithms for SEF and total power were disassembled, comprehensively annotated and compared to their theoretically ideal behaviors. A bug was identified in the device's implementation of the SEF algorithm, which can be provoked by a perfectly isoelectric EEG.
This article demonstrates that the electronic design of the A-2000 BIS Monitor does not pose any insuperable obstacles to retrieving its device software in hexadecimal machine code form directly from the motherboard. This software can be reverse engineered through disassembly and decompilation to reveal the methods by which the BIS monitor implements its algorithms, which ultimately must form the definitive statement of its function. Without further revealing any algorithms that might be considered trade secrets, the manufacturer of the BIS monitor should be encouraged to release the device software in its original format to place BIS-related academic literature on a firm theoretical foundation and to promote further academic development of EEG monitoring algorithms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33093360/
31159263,Use of Multiple EEG Features and Artificial Neural Network to Monitor the Depth of Anesthesia.,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019,"Gu Y, Liang Z, Hagihira S","The electroencephalogram (EEG) can reflect brain activity and contains abundant information of different anesthetic states of the brain. It has been widely used for monitoring depth of anesthesia (DoA). In this study, we propose a method that combines multiple EEG-based features with artificial neural network (ANN) to assess the DoA. Multiple EEG-based features can express the states of the brain more comprehensively during anesthesia. First, four parameters including permutation entropy, 95% spectral edge frequency, BetaRatio and SynchFastSlow were extracted from the EEG signal. Then, the four parameters were set as the inputs to an ANN which used bispectral index (BIS) as the reference output. 16 patient datasets during propofol anesthesia were used to evaluate this method. The results indicated that the accuracies of detecting each state were 86.4% (awake), 73.6% (light anesthesia), 84.4% (general anesthesia), and 14% (deep anesthesia). The correlation coefficient between BIS and the index of this method was 0.892 ( p < 0.001 ). The results showed that the proposed method could well distinguish between awake and other anesthesia states. This method is promising and feasible for a monitoring system to assess the DoA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159263/

General anesthesia was induced with stepwise-increased target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol until loss of consciousness (LOC). During surgery propofol was titrated according to BIS. Both Ai and BIS were recorded. Primary outcomes: the limits of agreement between Ai and BIS were -17.68 and 16.49, which were, respectively, -30.0% and 28.0% of the mean value of BIS. Secondary outcomes: prediction probability (Pk) of BIS and Ai was 0.943 and 0.935 (p=0.102) during LOC and 0.928 and 0.918 (p=0.037) during recovery of consciousness (ROC). And the values of BIS and Ai were 68.19 and 66.44 at 50%LOC, and 76.65 and 78.60 at 50%ROC. A decrease or an increase of Ai was significantly greater than that of BIS when consciousness changes (during LOC: -9.13±10.20 versus -5.83±9.63, p<0.001; during ROC: 10.88±11.51 versus 5.32±7.53, p<0.001).

The bispectral index (BIS) was developed primarily to monitor the depth of unconsciousness. Recent evidence suggests that BIS may also help in the assessment of brain injury. This study explores the correlation between GCS scores and BIS values in patients with brain injury.
Fifty patients were divided into 2 groups-moderate (GCS 9-12) and severe (GCS 3-8)-in this prospective, double-blind, observational study. Bispectral index data were recorded when electromyography was less than 40 and signal quality index was greater than 75 for 5 minutes. Linear regression was used to examine the correlation between BIS and GCS, and receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted. Cutoff points were identified to show the feasibility and accuracy of BIS for assessing brain injury.
The mean BIS value of the moderate group was 65.62 ± 12.84, and that of the severe group was 46.27 ± 17.35. Bispectral index values were significantly correlated with GCS (R = 0.729, P < .01). The regression line and 95% confidence interval were determined; the regression equation was BIS = 5.46*GCS + 12.72. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed high diagnostic accuracy when GCS is less than 9; the area under the curve was 0.8164, and the cutoff point (BIS value) corresponding to the maximum sensitivity (0.91) and specificity (0.63) was 60.2.

30607805,The fundamental contribution of the electromyogram to a high bispectral index: a postoperative observational study.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2019,"Hayashi K, Sawa T","The electromyogram (EMG) activity has been reported to falsely increase BIS. Conversely, EMG seems necessary to constitute the high BIS indicative of an awake condition, and may play a fundamental role in calculating BIS, rather than distorting the appropriate BIS. However, exactly how EMG is associated with a high BIS remains unclear. We intended to clarify the respective contributions of EMG and various electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters to high BIS. In 79 courses of anaesthesia, BIS monitor-derived EMG parameters (EMGLOW), and other processed EEG parameters [SEF95 (spectral edge frequency 95%), SynchFastSlow (bispectral parameter), BetaRatio (frequency parameter), total power subtypes in five frequency range], were obtained simultaneously with BIS, every 3 s. These EEG parameters were used for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of detecting three BIS levels (BIS > 80, BIS > 70, and BIS > 60) to assess their diagnosabilities. A total of 218,418 data points derived from 79 cases were used for analysis. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated and optimal cut-off (threshold) was determined by Youden index. As the results, for detecting BIS > 80, the AUC of EMGLOW was 0.975 [0.974-0.977] (mean [95% confidence interval]), significantly higher than any other processed EEG parameters such as BetaRatio (0.832 [0.828-0.835]), SEF95 (0.821 [0.817-0.826]) and SynchFastSlow (0.769 [0.764-0.774]) (p < 0.05 each). The threshold of EMGLOW for detecting BIS > 80 was 35.7 dB, with high sensitivity (92.5%) and high specificity (96.5%).

Ultrasound of 19 muscles was performed in 44 patients with a recent diagnosis (<90 days) of ALS. The number of fasciculations was recorded in each muscle and the muscle thickness and strength were additionally measured in limb muscles. A subgroup of patients were electromyographically assessed.
US was performed in 835 muscles and EMG was available in 263 muscles. US detected fasciculations more frequently than EMG. Fasciculations were widespread, especially in upper limbs onset patients and in the cervical region. Fasciculations' number inversely associated with ALSFR-R and body mass index (BMI) and directly with BMI loss and upper motor neuron (UMN) impairment. Our statistical model suggest that fasciculations increase with the initial lower motor neuron (LMN) degeneration, reach their peak when the muscle became mildly to moderately weak, decreasing afterwards with increasing muscle weakness and atrophy.
Our study suggests that both UMN and LMN degeneration trigger fasciculations causing BMI loss. The degree of LMN impairment could account for differences in fasciculations' rates within and between muscles.

One hundred and twenty young (20-30 years), middle-aged (31-65 years), and elderly (66-80 years) patients were randomly allocated to receive either desflurane or sevoflurane (n = 20, each group). General anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg bolus and remifentanil 0.25 µg/kg/min, which was stopped after tracheal intubation.

Power spectral analysis is an important method for feature detection in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Several spectral parameters derived from EEG have been proposed for measuring DOA in clinical applications. In the present paper, an improved method based on phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) is designed to improve the predictive accuracy of relative alpha and beta power, a frequency band power ratio, total power, median frequency (MF), spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), and spectral entropy for assessing anesthetic drug effects. Fifty-six patients undergoing general anesthesia in an operating theatre are studied. All EEG signals are continuously recorded from the awake state to the end of the recovery state and then filtered using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). All parameters are evaluated using the commercial bispectral index (BIS) and expert assessment of conscious level (EACL), respectively. The ability to predict DOA is estimated using the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). All indicators based on the improved method can clearly discriminate the conscious state from the anesthetized state after filtration (p  <  0.05). A significantly larger mean AUC (p  <  0.05) shows that the improved method performs better than the conventional method to measure the DOA in most circumstances. Especially for raw EEG contaminated by artifacts, when the BIS index is used to indicate the consciousness level, the improvement is 7.37% (p  <  0.05), 9.04% (p  <  0.05), 18.46% (p  <  0.05), 27.73% (p  <  0.05), 14.65% (p  <  0.05), 2.52%, 5.38% and 6.24% (p  <  0.05) for relative alpha and beta power, power ratio, total power, MF, SEF, RE and SE, respectively.

Bispectral index (BIS), developed to quantify the deepness of general anesthesia, may be used as a simplified tool to evaluate natural sleep depth. We objectively recorded sleep architecture in young patients using the latest BIS Vista monitor and correlated BIS values with PSG sleep stages in order to determine BIS thresholds. Patients, referred for the screening of sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome or differential diagnosis of hypersomnia were recruited. Overnight PSG and BIS were performed simultaneously. BIS values were averaged for each sleep stage. Pre-sleep wakefulness (W) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were also differentiated. BIS values were discarded for a signal quality index <90 %. ROC curves were plotted to discriminate sleep stages from each other. Twelve patients (5.7-29.3 years old) were included. Mean BIS values were 83 ± 8, 76 ± 12, 77 ± 11, 70 ± 10, 43 ± 10, and 75 ± 10 for W, WASO, N1, N2, N3 and R (REM) stages, respectively. BIS failed to distinguish W, WASO, N1 and R stages.

We hypothesized that CDSA could be helpful for monitoring NCSE in critically subjects if continuous EEG (cEEG) is not available.
we retrospectively analyzed comatose patients admitted to our neurological intensive care unit (NICU) from 2011 to 2014 with a diagnosis of definitive NCSE that underwent b-BIS monitoring for at least 24h to guide anesthetic sedation. Clinical, electroencephalography and neuroimaging findings were analyzed. Moreover, all parameters from the b-BIS data including the CDSA were reviewed during periods of NCSE (NCSE pattern) and profound sedation (sedation pattern).
15 NCSE patients were included. The delay from the diagnosis of NCSE to the onset of b-BIS monitoring was 8 (0.5-31)h and total time of b-BIS monitoring 7.8±6.5 days. CDSA during NCSE pattern was characterized by continuous or intermittent red and dark red tones, spectral edge frequency (SEF) in the delta-theta range, with or without asymmetry and BIS number trend with significant variability. In contrast, CDSA during sedation revealed predominance of orange, yellow, green and occasionally blue tones, SEF in the alpha-beta range, absence of asymmetry and stability of BIS number.

This study seeks to answer the question: ""To what degree can EEG suppression and burst count as measured by diagnostic EEG during drug-induced coma be predicted from data obtained from the BIS such as BIS value, suppression ratio (SR), and burst count?""
During drug-induced coma, cortical EEG is the gold standard for real-time monitoring and drug titration. Diagnostic EEG is, from setup through data analysis, labor intensive, costly, and difficult to maintain uniform clinician competency. BIS monitoring is less expensive, less labor-intensive, and easier to interpret data and establish/maintain competency. Validating BIS data versus diagnostic EEG facilitates effective brain monitoring during drug-induced coma at lower cost with similar outcomes.
This is a prospective, observational cohort study. Four consecutive patients receiving drug-induced coma/EEG monitoring were enrolled. BIS was initiated after informed consent. Variables recorded per minute included presence or absence of EEG burst suppression, burst count, BIS value over time, burst count, and SR. Pearson's product-moment and Spearman rank coefficient for BIS value and SR versus burst count were performed. Regression analysis was utilized to plot BIS values versus bursts/minute on EEG as well as SR versus burst count on EEG. EEG/BIS data were collected from digital data files and transcribed onto data sheets for corresponding time indices.
Four patients yielded 1,972 data sets over 33 hours of EEG/BIS monitoring. Regression coefficient of 0.6673 shows robust predictive value between EEG burst count and BIS SR. Spearman rank coefficient of -0.8727 indicates strong inverse correlation between EEG burst count and BIS SR. Pearson's correlation coefficient between EEG versus BIS burst count was .8256 indicating strong positive correlation. Spearman's rank coefficient of 0.8810 and Pearson's correlation coefficient of .6819 showed strong correlation between BIS value versus EEG burst count. Number of patients (4) limits available statistics and ability to generalize results. Graphs and statistics show strong correlation/predictive value for BIS parameters to EEG suppression.
This study is the first to measure correlation and predictive value between BIS monitoring and diagnostic EEG for degree of EEG suppression and burst count in the adult population. Available statistic tests and graphing of variables from BIS and diagnostic EEG show strong correlation and predictive value between both monitoring technologies during drug-induced coma. These support using BIS value, SR, and burst count to predict degree of EEG suppression in real time for titrating metabolic suppression therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25629593/

Forty adult patients undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia.
Blocked randomisation of 20 patients per anaesthetic group (sevoflurane/remifentanil or propofol/remifentanil). Isolated forearm technique for differentiation between consciousness and unconsciousness.
Prediction probability (PK) of state entropy to discriminate consciousness from unconsciousness. Correlation and agreement between state entropy and BIS from deep to light hypnosis. Analysis of raw EEG compared with index values that are in conflict with clinical examination, with frequency measures (frequency bands/Spectral Edge Frequency 95) and visual inspection for physiological EEG patterns (e.g. beta or delta arousal), pathophysiological features such as high-frequency signals (electromyogram/high-frequency EEG or eye fluttering/saccades), different types of electro-oculogram or epileptiform EEG and technical artefacts.
PK of state entropy was 0.80 and of BIS 0.84; correlation coefficient of state entropy with BIS 0.78. Nine percent BIS and 14% state entropy values disagreed with clinical examination. Highest incidence of disagreement occurred after state transitions, in particular for state entropy after loss of consciousness during sevoflurane anaesthesia. EEG sequences which led to false 'conscious' index values often showed high-frequency signals and eye blinks. High-frequency EEG/electromyogram signals were pooled because a separation into EEG and fast electro-oculogram, for example eye fluttering or saccades, on the basis of a single EEG channel may not be very reliable. These signals led to higher Spectral Edge Frequency 95 and ratio of relative beta and gamma band power than EEG signals, indicating adequate unconscious classification. The frequency of other artefacts that were assignable, for example technical artefacts, movement artefacts, was negligible and they were excluded from analysis.
High-frequency signals and eye blinks may account for index values that falsely indicate consciousness. Compared with BIS, state entropy showed more false classifications of the clinical state at transition between consciousness and unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25564779/

This may be due to frequency changes occurring in the EEG during development. Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is based primarily in the time domain and hence may have greater utility in infants.
To investigate the relationship between age adjusted Minimal Alveolar Concentration (MAC) multiples and aEEG in children under 2 years of age.
The aEEG, Spectral Edge Frequency 90% (SEF90) and Bispectral Index™ (BIS) were investigated in a prospective study of children <2 years of age. After anesthetic induction, and caudal block administration, EEG data were collected simultaneously with BrainZ BRM2™ and BIS™ monitors. Using a randomized crossover design, children received up to three age adjusted concentrations of sevoflurane: 0.75, 1 and 1.25 MAC. After 15 min of stable anesthetic delivery EEG readings were obtained. Prediction Probability (Pk ) and correlation coefficients were calculated for each EEG parameter.
From 51 children 102 stable anesthetics concentrations were obtained. For all age groups Pk of aEEG to multiple of age adjusted MAC was <0.72 indicating a poor predictive power for aEEG. In contrast for the SEF90 and BIS there was evidence for better predictive properties in children aged between 6 months and 2 years, with a Pk >0.81.
The aEEG is unlikely to be a useful measure of anesthesia depth in young children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24612073/

The usefulness of bispectral index (BIS) in monitoring human anesthesia is well established. However, the validity of its application remains unproven in laboratory animals. We assessed whether BIS could be used reliably in monitoring the depth of deep anesthesia in 8 New Zealand white rabbits. Experimental baseline anesthesia was maintained with continuous infusion of propofol and administration of isoflurane, both of which were titrated to EEG activity. The rabbits were allocated randomly to receive 3 increasing concentrations of common anesthetic drugs (etomidate, propofol, and isoflurane) aimed to produce burst suppression of EEG activity yielding at least 10 s of sustained EEG silence. Rabbits had a 20-min recovery interval between challenges. Transient cerebral hypoperfusion to produce reversible EEG silence due to ischemia was induced as a fourth challenge, followed by terminal arrest, in each animal. BIS, EEG, and physiologic data were analyzed for each rabbit. We observed stable BIS values in the range of 40 to 60 during the administration of baseline anesthesia. However, as the depth of anesthesia deepened with the anesthetic drug challenges, the BIS value paradoxically increased with increasing doses. The BIS signal quality index declined while the total power decreased. In contrast to these unexpected results, BIS values decreased rapidly to near 0 during terminal arrest, as expected. Therefore, we do not consider BIS to be a useful method for monitoring deep levels of anesthesia in laboratory rabbits.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24411783/
22584553,The impact of nitrous oxide on electroencephalographic bicoherence during isoflurane anesthesia.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2012,"Hagihira S, Takashina M, Mori T, Mashimo T","We previously reported that electroencephalographic (EEG) bicoherence, the degree of phase coupling among the frequency components of a signal, showed 2 peaks during isoflurane anesthesia. Hayashi et al. (Br J Anaesth 2007;99:389-95) also revealed that the peak frequency of bicoherence around 10 Hz increased when ketamine was added. Because nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and ketamine share several common features, they are often treated as the same category of anesthetic. Here, we investigated the effect of N(2)O on EEG bicoherence and other EEG derivatives during isoflurane anesthesia.
Twenty patients (aged 34-72 years, ASA physical status I and II) of either gender who underwent elective laparoscopic surgery were included. Raw EEG data, along with EEG-derived parameters, were recorded using an A-1050 Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor and our self-authored Bispectral Analyzer for BIS software. We compared 2 peaks of EEG bicoherence (pBIC-low, around 4 Hz; and pBIC-high, around 10 Hz), as well as BIS and spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF95). Anesthesia was induced with 3 mg · kg(-1) thiopental and 3 μg · kg(-1) fentanyl. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (expired concentration at 1.0%), oxygen, and nitrogen. Fentanyl was added and maintained at an estimated effect-site concentration of >1.5 ng · mL(-1). We obtained baseline data 1 hour after induction of anesthesia, then 70% N(2)O was added for 30 minutes.
Before N(2)O, pBIC-low and pBIC-high were 49.3% ± 8.3% and 42.4% ± 11.0%. Ten minutes after starting N(2)O, pBIC-high decreased to 14.9% ± 5.9% (P < 0.001), and it was statistically significantly lower throughout the N(2)O period. Meanwhile, pBIC-low transiently decreased to 37.2% ± 12.8% (P = 0.01) during the early phase of N(2)O administration. Before N(2)O, BIS and SEF95 were 43.2 ± 4.9 and 13.1 ± 2.0 Hz, respectively. Both BIS and SEF95 slightly but statistically significantly decreased during N(2)O administration. Fifteen minutes after starting N(2)O, BIS and SEF95 were 35.7 ± 6.2 (P < 0.001) and 8.6 ± 1.8 Hz (P < 0.001) and they decreased more when large δ waves emerged. Fifteen minutes after stopping N(2)O, BIS, SEF95, as well as pBIC-low and pBIC-high returned to pre-N(2)O values.
Dissimilar to the effect of ketamine, N(2)O significantly decreases pBIC-high during isoflurane anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22584553/

The bispectral index (BIS) monitor incorporated hardware and software changes to eliminate artifacts, thus allowing BIS monitoring even in the presence of electrocautery. We evaluated the accuracy of BIS to measure anesthetic effect during electrocautery interference.
Anesthesia was induced and maintained with target-controlled infusions of propofol (3 μg/mL) and remifentanil (4 ng/mL). After baseline BIS recordings, ""simulated"" electrocautery interference was induced continuously for 20 minutes. Five minutes after the start of electrocautery, propofol infusion was increased to achieve an effect site concentration of 6 μg/mL. Patients remained undisturbed during the study. BIS values and signal quality index were recorded continuously.
During electrocautery, there was a significant decrease in signal quality index (mean difference: 16.9; 95% confidence intervals: 15.9-17.9; P<0.001). There was, however, no change in BIS value even after a step increase in propofol infusion from 3 to 6 μg/mL (P=0.93). In 22% of the patients there was a paradoxical increase in BIS values after doubling of propofol concentration. Following cessation of electrocautery, there was a prompt decrease in BIS (P<0.001), indicating a lack of response to the change in anesthetic depth during electrocautery.
Rejecting and filtering artifacts from electrocautery interference reduced the ability of BIS to respond to a change in anesthetic depth. BIS values during electrocautery should be interpreted with caution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21946766/

Subjects comprised 11 patients scheduled to undergo heart surgery under extracorporeal circulation. Anesthesia was maintained by intravenous administration of propofol combined with remifentanil, using a bispectral index (BIS) monitor to keep an identical BIS value (target BIS value, 40-45). Raw EEG signals were collected through the BIS monitor. Approximate entropy, bicoherence and power spectrum were analyzed before and after CPB, in addition to other EEG parameters.
In the late hypothermic CPB period, both 95% spectral edge frequency and approximate entropy decreased, notwithstanding a lack of significant difference in BIS index. Bicoherence growths in delta-theta and alpha areas decreased simultaneously.
In the late CPB period, although BIS value is unchanged, EEG often expresses a slow EEG rhythm accompanied by disproportional de-synchronous characteristics.
CPB caused the EEG de-synchronous features, which are not quantified by the BIS algorithm. It has the possibility to increase the vulnerability of nociceptive perception.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20382560/

Anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl and was maintained with propofol, fentanyl, epidural mepivacaine, and nitrous oxide in oxygen. During surgery, the propofol infusion rate was adjusted to try to keep BIS at 40 + or - 3 for 10 min and then decreased to keep the BIS at 60 + or - 3 for 10 min.
The BIS had a larger value for the time between switching on the apparatus and starting to measure at a signal quality index >75%. The recovery time from disturbance by an electric cautery event was 41 + or - 14 s for the BIS and 3 + or - 1 s for the CSI (P < 0.05). The absolute values of the BIS and CSI were not significantly different and they showed a good correlation. The bias (mean of the differences, BIS - CSI) was negative at all measurement points, but the limits of agreement and percentage error were small.

Twenty-four patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists status I or II were randomly allocated to receive either an intravenous (i.v.) bolus of midazolam 0.2 mg kg(-1) (small-dose group, n = 12) or 0.3 mg kg(-1) (large-dose group, n = 12) for induction of general anesthesia in a double-blind experimental design. The bispectral index (BIS), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95), spectral power density, and plasma concentrations of midazolam were measured for 60 min following the induction of general anesthesia.
Plasma and simulated effect-site concentrations of midazolam were significantly higher in the large-dose group than in the small-dose group (P = 0.005 and <0.001, respectively). There was a correlation between the relative beta ratio and BIS (r (2) = 0.30, P < 0.001; n = 168); however, effect-site concentrations of midazolam showed no association with BIS, relative beta ratio, or SEF95 (r (2) = 0.07, 0.11 and 0.01, respectively; n = 168). The electroencephalographic spectral power density in the beta-band (>/=13 and <30 Hz) was significantly increased after induction and was significantly larger in the large-dose group than in the small-dose group (P = 0.009).
Following the induction of general anesthesia with i.v. midazolam 0.2 or 0.3 mg kg(-1), the BIS was positively correlated with the relative beta ratio.

Sixty patients were randomly allocated to three groups according to the dose of remifentanil-0.1 (S), 0.2 (M), or 0.5 (L) microg kg(-1) min(-1), respectively. Infusion of remifentanil was started 5 min before the induction of general anesthesia with midazolam 0.2 mg/kg in all groups. Following the administration of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg, the trachea was intubated 5 min after induction, and the infusion rate of remifentanil was then reduced to 0.05 microg kg(-1) min(-1) in all groups. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), BIS, and 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) were measured until 10 min after tracheal intubation.
Infusion of remifentanil alone before the induction of anesthesia did not affect the hemodynamic or electroencephalographic parameters. MAP was significantly decreased after induction in all groups of patients (P < 0.01), with no differences among the three groups, while it was significantly increased after tracheal intubation in the patients of groups S and M, but not in those of group L. The HR did not change after induction in any of the groups, but it was also significantly increased after tracheal intubation of group S and M patients, although not in those of group L. The BIS decreased after induction, and both the BIS and SEF95 were significantly lower in group L patients than in those of group S (P < 0.01). All patients were unconscious after induction, and none complained of intraoperative awareness.
In our patient cohort, remifentanil 0.5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) effectively decreased the BIS after the induction of general anesthesia with midazolam 0.2 mg/kg and suppressed the increase of MAP and HR in response to subsequent laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20186436/

Using direct visual feedback of torque, six healthy subjects were asked to perform two incremental isometric elbow flexions, consisting of linear torque ramps of 30 s from 0 to 40% of maximal voluntary contraction. Both electromyographic (EMG) activity and shear elastic modulus were continuously measured in the biceps brachii during the two ramps. There was significant linear regression (P<0.001) between shear elastic modulus and EMG activity level for both ramps of all six subjects (R2=0.94+/-0.05, ranging from 0.82 to 0.98). Good repeatability was found for shear elastic modulus estimated at both 3% (trial 1: 21.7+/-6.7 kPa; trial 2: 23.2+/-7.2 kPa, intraclass correlation coefficient=0.89, standard error in measurement=2.3 kPa, coefficient of variation=12.7%) and 7% (trial 1: 42.6+/-14.1 kPa; trial 2: 44.8+/-15.8 kPa, intraclass correlation coefficient=0.94, standard error in measurement=3.7 kPa, coefficient of variation=7.1%) of maximal EMG activity. The shear elastic modulus estimated at both 3 and 7% of maximal EMG activity was not significantly different (P>0.05) between the two trials. These results confirm our hypothesis that the use of supersonic shear imaging greatly improves the correlation between muscle shear elastic modulus and EMG activity level. Due to the nonlinearity of muscle mechanical properties, the muscle elasticity should be linked to the muscle stress. Therefore, the present study represents a first step in attempting to show that supersonic shear imaging can be used to indirectly estimate muscle stress.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20167669/

If hypoxia per se changes BIS and spectral entropy values, BIS and spectral entropy values may not correctly reflect the depth of anaesthesia during hypoxia. The aim of this study was to examine the changes in BIS and spectral entropy values during hypobaric hypoxia in volunteers.
The study was conducted in a high-altitude chamber with 11 volunteers. After the subjects breathed 100% oxygen for 15 min at the ground level, the simulated altitude increased gradually to the 7620 m (25,000 ft) level while the subjects continued to breathe oxygen. Then, the subjects discontinued to breath oxygen and breathed room air at the 7620 m level for up to 5 min until they requested to stop hypoxic exposure. Oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate, 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), BIS, response entropy (RE), and state entropy (SE) of spectral entropy were recorded throughout the study period.
Of the 11 subjects, seven subjects who underwent hypoxic exposure for 4 min were analysed. SpO2 decreased to 69% at the 7620 m level without oxygen. However, SEF, BIS, RE, and SE before and during hypoxic exposure were almost identical.
These data suggest that hypoxia of oxygen saturation around 70% does not have a strong effect on BIS and spectral entropy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19397504/

This study assessed the effects of joint angular velocity on the immediate changes in passive musculo-articular properties induced by cyclic stretching allowing an appreciation of viscosity and friction, and their contribution to changes in torque that occur.
Ten healthy subjects performed five passive knee extension/flexion cycles on a Biodex dynamometer at five preset angular velocities (5-120 deg/s). The passive torque and knee angle were measured, and the potential elastic energy stored during the loading and the dissipation coefficient were calculated.
As the stretching velocity increased, so did stored elastic energy and the dissipation coefficient. The slope of the linear relationship between the dissipation coefficient and the angular velocity was unchanged across repetitions indicating that viscosity was unlikely to be affected. A difference in the y-intercept across repetitions 1 and 5 was indicative of a change in processes associated with solid friction. Electromyographical responses to stretching were low across all joint angular velocities.
Torque changes during cyclic motion may primarily involve solid friction which is more indicative of rearrangement/slipping of collagen fibers rather than the redistribution of fluid and its constituents within the muscle. The findings also suggest that it is better to stretch slowly initially to reduce the amount of energy absorption required by tissues, but thereafter higher stretching speeds can be undertaken.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19064307/

This was a prospective observational study in 92 patients with cardiac arrest who received basic life support from a fire-fighter squad and ACLS on arrival of an emergency medical team on the scene. BIS values, electromyographic activity, and signal quality index were recorded throughout resuscitation and out-of-hospital management.
Seven patients had recovered spontaneous cardiac activity by the time the medical team arrived on scene. Of the 92 patients, 62 patients died on scene and 30 patients returned to spontaneous cardiac activity and were admitted to hospital. The correlation between BIS values and end-tidal CO(2) during the first minutes of ACLS was poor (r(2)=0.02, P=0.19). Of the 30 admitted patients, 27 died. Three were discharged with no disabilities. There was no significant difference in BIS values on admission between the group of patients who died and the group who survived (P=0.78).
Although BIS monitoring during resuscitation was not difficult, it did not predict return to spontaneous cardiac activity, nor survival after admission to intensive care. Its use to monitor cerebral function during ACLS is therefore pointless.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19058894/

Ninety patients undergoing major surgery scheduled for postoperative mechanical ventilation and continuous sedation with propofol and fentanyl were selected. Electrodes for determining BIS and auditory evoked potential were placed on the foreheads of all patients according to manufacturer's specifications at least six hours after patients' arrival at the intensive care unit. Ramsay Sedation Scale, BIS, signal quality index, composite A-line autoregressive index (AAI) and electromyographic activities were recorded every five minutes for 30 minutes. BIS and AAI showed good correlation amongst readings (r(s)=0.697, P <0.01). Both were significantly influenced by electromyographic activities (BIS, r(s)=0.735, P <0.01; AAI, r(s)=0.856, P <0.01). Comparison of BIS and AAI revealed an acceptable correlation between electroencephalogram variables and the Ramsay Sedation Scale (BIS, tau=-0.689; AAI, tau=-0.621; P <0.01). In conclusion, the auditory evoked potential and BIS monitors revealed an acceptable correlation with the Ramsay Sedation Scale. However, the BIS and auditory evoked potential monitors do not perform adequately as a substitute in the assessment of sedated intensive care unit patients.

Sixty young (<40 yr) and elderly (>70 yr) patients were randomly allocated to one of the four groups. Anaesthesia was induced with 66% N(2)O and isoflurane in oxygen (Young-isoflurane and Elderly-isoflurane groups) or 66% N(2)O and sevoflurane in oxygen (Young-sevoflurane and Elderly-sevoflurane groups). Inhaled isoflurane and sevoflurane concentrations were gradually increased and the end-tidal concentrations were maintained at 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively. Tracheal intubation was performed 12 min after induction of anaesthesia.
There were significant differences in the overall changes in bispectral index (BIS) and 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) between young and elderly (P<0.001 for both), but not between patients receiving isoflurane and sevoflurane (P=0.4 and 0.3, respectively).

In sharp contrast, BIS and SEF95 remained unchanged in Elderly-isoflurane and Elderly-sevoflurane groups (P>0.7 for all). These results suggest that both BIS and SEF95 significantly decreased, despite the presence of increased sympathetic activity after tracheal intubation in young patients.

17591127,Bispectral index as a predictor of sedation depth during isoflurane or midazolam sedation in ICU patients.,Anaesthesia and intensive care,2007,"Sackey PV, Radell PJ, Granath F, Martling CR","Bispectral index (BIS) is used for monitoring anaesthetic depth with inhaled anaesthetic agents in the operating room but has not been evaluated as a monitor of sedation depth in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting with these agents. If BIS could predict sedation depth in ICU patients, patient disturbances could be reduced and oversedation avoided. Twenty ventilator-dependent ICU patients aged 27 to 80 years were randomised to sedation with isoflurane via the AnaConDa or intravenous midazolam. BIS (A-2000 XP, version 3.12), electromyogram activity (EMG) and Signal Quality Index were measured continuously. Hourly clinical evaluation of sedation depth according to Bloomsbury Sedation Score (Bloomsbury) was performed. The median BIS value during a 10-minute interval prior to the clinical evaluation at the bedside was compared with Bloomsbury. Nurses performing the clinical sedation scoring were blinded to the BIS values. End-tidal isoflurane concentration was measured and compared with Bloomsbury. Correlation was poor between BIS and Bloomsbury in both groups (Spearman's rho 0.012 in the isoflurane group and -0.057 in the midazolam group). Strong correlation was found between BIS and EMG (Spearman's rho 0.74). Significant correlation was found between end-tidal isoflurane concentration and Bloomsbury (Spearman's rho 0.47). In conclusion, BIS XP does not reliably predict sedation depth as measured by clinical evaluation in non-paralysed ICU patients sedated with isoflurane or midazolam. EMG contributes significantly to BIS values in isoflurane or midazolam sedated, non-paralysed ICU patients. End-tidal isoflurane concentration appeared to be a better indicator of clinical sedation depth than BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17591127/

Recently, bispectral index (BIS) derived from the frontal cortical electroencephalogram has been used frequently for quantifying the hypnotic component of anesthesia. The present study was designed to examine the BIS values produced by equi-MAC concentrations of halothane and isoflurane. In 34 patients undergoing spinal surgery, BIS and spectral edge frequency (SEF95) were recorded at 3 different concentrations of halothane and isoflurane--namely 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 MAC. The measurements were made both during wash-in and wash-out phases of the anesthetic agent. Eighteen patients received halothane and 16 received isoflurane. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, oxygen saturation, and end tidal carbon dioxide pressure values were not different between the 2 groups at various MAC concentrations of the anesthetic agents. BIS and SEF95 values decreased significantly with increasing concentrations of both the anesthetic agents (P<0.001). At any given MAC concentration of the anesthetic, BIS and SEF(95) values were significantly lower under isoflurane compared with halothane anesthesia both during wash-in and wash-out phases (P<0.001). For a given anesthetic agent, BIS values were comparable at equi-MAC concentrations during wash-in and wash-out phases. In conclusion, BIS values are significantly lower under isoflurane compared with halothane anesthesia at similar MAC concentrations. For a given anesthetic agent and a given MAC concentration, the BIS values are similar during wash-in and wash-out phases of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17413994/

In the present study we evaluated the relationship between EEG bicoherence and sevoflurane concentration. Sixteen ASA physical status I-II patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were enrolled in the study. Anesthesia was induced with 5% sevoflurane and maintained with sevoflurane and oxygen (50%). Just before surgery, IV fentanyl (2 microg/kg) was given and then continuously infused (2 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)). Using software we developed, EEG bicoherence, BIS, and 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) were recorded at end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations of 0.5%, 0.8%, 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.3%. Under light anesthesia, EEG bicoherence values were low. With increasing sevoflurane concentrations, 2 peaks of bicoherence emerged along the diagonal line (f1 = f2). Both the first (at around 4 Hz) and second (at around 10 Hz) grew higher (37.7% +/- 7.5% and 35.1% +/- 9.0%, respectively) as the sevoflurane concentration increased to 1.4%. However, the first peak leveled off whereas the second tended to decrease slightly with further increases in sevoflurane concentration. The BIS value decreased as the sevoflurane concentration increased and leveled off at 1.4% and higher concentrations of sevoflurane. The SEF 95 also decreased as the sevoflurane concentration increased up to 2.3%.

16816395,Sedation during spinal anaesthesia in infants.,British journal of anaesthesia,2006,"Hermanns H, Stevens MF, Werdehausen R, Braun S, Lipfert P, Jetzek-Zader M","Neuraxial anaesthesia in adults decreases the dose of i.v. or inhalational anaesthetic needed to reach a desired level of sedation. Furthermore, spinal anaesthesia alone has a sedative effect. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is presumed to be decreased afferent stimulation of the reticular activating system after sympatholysis. We hypothesized that this mechanism is equally active in infants undergoing spinal anaesthesia.
In total, 20 unpremedicated former preterm infants underwent surgery under spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% 1 mg kg(-1) with epinephrine 10 microg kg(-1). No additional sedatives or anaesthetics were administered. Sedation was evaluated using the bispectral index (BIS) score and the 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF(95)).
After spinal anaesthesia, mean (SD) BIS began to decrease significantly from baseline 97.0 (1.1) to 83.9 (14.4) after 15 min (P=0.006). BIS decreased further, reaching the lowest values after 30 min [62.2 (14.0); P<0.00001]. Mean (SD) SEF(95) declined from baseline 26.1 (1.8) Hz to 24.3 (3.1) after 5 min (P=0.02) and further to 9.9 (3.8) after 30 min (P<0.00001). Mean arterial pressure also decreased significantly from 66.5 (4.7) mm Hg within 10 min to 56.1 (5.6) after spinal anaesthesia (P=0.0002), while heart rate remained stable.
These results suggest that sedation after spinal anaesthesia in infants is at least as pronounced as in adults. The sedative effect of spinal anaesthesia should be kept in mind when additional sedatives are administered, especially in former preterm infants.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16816395/

The authors evaluated the difference in signal quality index (SQI) and BIS values collected from two BIS monitors, using ECG electrodes and BIS electrodes on the same patients before anesthesia, during light anesthesia, deep anesthesia and the emergence period Both sets of electrodes were placed at bifrontal areas throughout the procedure. Statistical analysis was evaluated by mean difference 95% confidence limits of agreement and visualized by Bland-Altman plot. A parametric analysis was analyzed using paired t-test.
There were 390 parallel signal quality index and BIS values recorded in the present study. During anesthesia the mean BIS values were 58.63 +/- 18.77 in the ECG electrode group and 56.99 +/- 19.84 in the BIS electrode group, which were not statistically different.

In protocol 1, we randomly allocated 90 ASA physical status I patients to 6 groups (n = 15 each). Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane or sevoflurane with 0%, 33%, or 66% N2O. The concentration of isoflurane and sevoflurane was gradually increased and end-tidal concentrations were maintained at 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively. Tracheal intubation was performed 12 min after induction of anesthesia. BIS was significantly increased 1 min after tracheal intubation compared before laryngoscopy in patients receiving only isoflurane or sevoflurane (P = 0.001 and 0.007, respectively). In patients receiving 66% N2O-isoflurane or 66% N2O-sevoflurane, both BIS and SEF95 were significantly decreased after tracheal intubation and significantly lower than in those patients receiving only isoflurane or sevoflurane, respectively (P < 0.01 for both).

16199415,Concentration-dependent suppression of F-waves by sevoflurane does not predict immobility to painful stimuli in humans.,British journal of anaesthesia,2005,"Baars JH, Kalisch D, Herold KF, Hadzidiakos DA, Rehberg B","Decreased spinal excitability contributes to the immobilizing effects of halogenated ethers during general anaesthesia. Recurrent spinal responses such as F-waves reflect spinal excitability and are suppressed by volatile anaesthetics. To evaluate whether F-waves are suitable for monitoring immobility, the concentration-dependent effects of sevoflurane on F-waves were compared with effects on the Bispectral Index (BIS). The predictive power of all parameters for movement responses to noxious stimuli was tested. In addition, the effect of the noxious stimulus itself on F-waves was investigated.
In 28 patients, F-waves were recorded during sevoflurane anaesthesia at a frequency of 0.2 Hz at the lower limb. To insert a laryngeal mask, the sevoflurane concentration was initially increased to approximately 4%, which caused a complete extinction of F-waves. The sevoflurane concentration was then reduced until the F-waves recovered. BIS and spectral edge frequency (SEF(95)) were recorded continuously. The t(1/2ke0) and EC(50) values of the F-wave persistence and amplitude were calculated using a standard pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. During decreasing sevoflurane concentration motor responses to tetanic electrical stimulation (50 Hz, 60 mA, 5 s, volar forearm) were tested in seven patients and MAC(tetanus) was calculated using logistic regression.
Sevoflurane reduces the F-wave amplitude with an EC(50) of 0.79 vol% at a far lower concentration than the calculated MAC(tetanus) (1.5 vol%), whereas the F-wave persistence yields an EC(50) of 1.4 vol%. Spinal and EEG parameters predicted the motor responses to movement better than chance alone, but did not differ significantly from each other.
F-waves, especially the F-wave amplitude, cannot be used to predict movement to noxious stimuli during sevoflurane anaesthesia because they are almost completely suppressed at subclinical sevoflurane concentrations. Either the particular motoneurone pool (the largest motoneurones) assessed by F-waves is not involved in generating movement to painful stimuli or direct effects on motoneurone excitability are not involved in the suppression of movement to painful stimuli by sevoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16199415/
16192535,Can electroencephalographic analysis be used to determine sedation levels in critically ill patients?,Anesthesia and analgesia,2005,"Roustan JP, Valette S, Aubas P, Rondouin G, Capdevila X","Prolonged use of sedative drugs frequently leads to oversedation of intensive care patients. Clinical assessment scales are not reliable in deeply sedated patients. Parameters obtained from spectral and bispectral analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) records have been combined to create an index (BIS) to monitor anesthesia depth. The role of such parameters in monitoring the depth of the sedation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients has yet to be determined. We designed the present prospective study to redefine and calculate available spectral and bispectral parameters from raw EEG records and estimate their clinical relevance for the diagnosis of under- or oversedation levels in ICU patients. Forty adult patients receiving continuous midazolam and morphine sedation were included. We obtained 167 clinical evaluations of sedation level using Ramsay and COMFORT scales along with an EEG record of 300 s. Six spectral parameters-relative power of 4 frequency bands (beta, alpha, Theta, and delta), 95th percentile of the power spectrum (SEF95), and 50th percentile of the power spectrum (SEF50) and four bispectral parameters, real triple product, bispectrum (Bispectrum), bicoherence, and ratio 10-were calculated. The relevance of each of these parameters and combinations in predicting too light (Ramsay 1 and 2) or deep (Ramsay 5 and 6) sedation levels was assessed. These calculations were performed before and after exclusion of the agitated patients, whose COMFORT 4 score was above 2. The most relevant parameters for predicting levels of deep sedation (Ramsay 5 and 6) were ratio 10 (area under the curve = 0.763; 95% confidence interval, 0.679-0.833) and SEF95 (area under the curve = 0.687; 95% confidence interval, 0.597-0.767). The most relevant parameters for predicting light levels of sedation (Ramsay 1 and 2) were also ratio 10 (area under the curve = 0.829; 95% confidence interval, 0.695-0.917) and SEF95 (area under the curve = 0.798; 95% confidence interval, 0.650-0.898). There is a modest improvement in relevance of their linear combination in predicting sedation level. Results were similar after exclusion of agitated patients. We conclude that various calculated EEG descriptive parameters exhibited large interindividual variability. There was a strong correlation between EEG spectral and bispectral parameters. Bispectral analysis slightly improves the predictive power of simple spectral analysis in distinguishing too light or deep sedation levels in ICU patients.
Spectral edge frequency 95 and Ratio 10 are the most relevant electroencephalogram (EEG) indexes for monitoring the level of sedation in intensive care unit patients but calculated EEG values exhibited large interindividual variability.

In some instances, painful stimulation in the presence of inadequate anesthesia results in a suppression of the electroencephalogram. This phenomenon has been referred to as a ""paradoxical arousal."" In our daily practice, we have noted a marked decrease in the bispectral index (BIS) with large delta waves during abdominal surgery when the abdominal cavity was irrigated with normal saline. In the present study, we sought to evaluate changes in BIS during intraabdominal irrigation. Eighteen ASA physical status I-II patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were enrolled in the study and allocated randomly to the control group (group C) or the fentanyl group (group F). Anesthesia was induced with 3 mg/kg of thiopental and was maintained with sevoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide. BIS, 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95), and burst-suppression ratio were recorded using a BIS monitor. Near the end of the procedure, but before irrigation of the abdominal cavity, 1.5 microg/kg fentanyl was given IV to group F. There was no significant change in BIS or SEF95 in group F patients during subsequent irrigation of the abdominal cavity. In contrast, BIS and SEF95 decreased significantly after start of irrigation in group C patients. These data show that the stimulation occurring during intraabdominal irrigation might cause a paradoxical arousal response, as evidenced by a decrease in processed electroencephalographic parameters. Pretreatment with fentanyl suppressed these changes. Anesthesiologists should be aware of this paradoxical arousal response to avoid an inappropriate decrease in the anesthetic concentration in such situations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15845688/

Patients were continuously sedated using propofol and sufentanil.
Electrodes for determination of BIS were placed at the forehead of the patients according to the manufacturer's specifications immediately after arrival to the intensive care unit. The level of consciousness was assessed every 2 hrs by a clinical sedation scale (Ramsay sedation scale, levels 1-6). BIS, electromyographic activity, and signal quality index were recorded simultaneously at the same time as the Ramsay scale for 24 hrs or until patients were ready for extubation. BIS (version 2.10) and BIS XP (version 3.12) were determined at 2-hr intervals. BIS and BIS XP showed a high correlation of readings (rs = .79, p < .01). However, the methods did not yield identical results. Both variables were significantly influenced by electromyographic activity, especially at high values, whereas there was only a weak correlation with body temperature. Some of the deeply sedated patients (Ramsay 5 or 6) had BIS readings >80 (BIS, 16%; BIS XP, 13%; p = not significant).
The newer algorithm BIS XP did not perform better than the previous version BIS in patients after major surgery who were mechanically ventilated and sedated on an intensive care unit.

Twenty-five critically ill, unconscious brain-injured patients from whom sedative drugs were withdrawn at least 24 h before BIS recording were prospectively studied. BIS, 95% spectral edge frequency, burst suppression ratio, and frontal electromyography were recorded for 20 min. The neurologic condition of the patients was measured according to the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). Patients were followed up for assessment of recovery of consciousness for 6 months after the injury. The studied variables were compared between the group of patients who recovered consciousness and those who did not recover. Their predictive ability was evaluated by means of the Pk statistic. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to model the relation between variables and probability of recovery of consciousness. Cross-validation was used to validate the proposed model.
There were statistically significant differences between the group of patients who recovered consciousness and those who did not with respect to BISmax, BISmin, BISmean, and BISrange, frontal electromyography, signal quality index values, and GCSBIS.

Here, they examined the influence of noxious stimuli on electroencephalographic bicoherence as well as on the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95).
The authors enrolled 48 elective abdominal surgery patients (aged 22-77 years; American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II). Raw electroencephalographic signals as well as BIS and SEF95 were recorded on a computer using a BIS monitor (A-1050) and Bispectrum Analyzer (BSA) for BIS (the authors' original software). Using BSA for BIS, the authors evaluated the two peak heights of electroencephalographic bicoherence. Anesthesia was induced with 3 mg/kg thiopental and was maintained with, in air-oxygen, 1.0% isoflurane or 1.5% sevoflurane. After confirming the steady state, the authors recorded baseline values. In experiment 1, they administered 3 microg/kg fentanyl 5 min after incision and investigated the changes in electroencephalographic derivatives at 5 and 10 min after incision. In experiment 2, they administered a similar dose of fentanyl 5 min before incision and investigated the changes in electroencephalographic derivatives immediately before and 5 min after incision.
In experiment 1, after incision, both peak heights of electroencephalographic bicoherence significantly decreased but returned to control values after fentanyl administration. By contrast, after incision, BIS and SEF95 showed individual variability. In experiment 2, although fentanyl itself did not affect all electroencephalographic derivatives before incision, the variables remained unchanged after incision.
Noxious stimuli decreased the peak heights of electroencephalographic bicoherence, an effect that was counteracted by fentanyl analgesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15087616/

The ability of the classic and processed electroencephalographic and hemodynamic parameters to predict the clinically relevant anesthetic states of awake, steady state anesthesia, first reaction, and extubation was tested using prediction probability.
Only the Narcotrend was able to differentiate between awake versus steady state anesthesia and steady state anesthesia versus first reaction/extubation with a prediction probability value of more than 0.90.

12707138,Low baseline Bispectral Index of the electroencephalogram in patients with dementia.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2003,"Renna M, Handy J, Shah A","The baseline value of the Bispectral Index (BIS) is 96-99 in the awake state. Patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia may show an increase in slow wave and a decrease in fast wave activity of the electroencephalogram (EEG). BIS is presumed to decrease with EEG slowing. We hypothesized that the baseline ""awake"" BIS is lower in dementia than in normal elderly patients. We studied 36 patients with Alzheimer's disease or multiinfarct dementia and 36 control patients aged >75 yr. Both groups were assessed with a Mini-Mental State Test. BIS (version 3.4) was recorded from a frontal derivation using an Aspect A-2000 EEG monitor. Off-line data analysis was also performed with the newer version 4.0 of the BIS algorithm. Fourteen of 36 (38%) dementia patients and 4 of 36 (11%) controls had mean baseline BIS 3.4 <93 (P = 0.006). Eighteen of 36 (50%) dementia patients and 8 of 36 (22%) controls had mean BIS 4.0 <93 (P = 0.026). Mean (95% confidence interval) BIS 3.4 was 92.9 (91-95) in the dementia and 96.1 (95-97) in the control group (P = 0.02). Values with BIS 4.0 were, respectively, 89.1 (86-92) and 94.7 (93-96) (P = 0.002). No significant difference was found in age, sex, activity from the electromyogram, and signal quality index. As expected, the difference in Mini-Mental State Test scores was significant (P < 0.0001). A significant proportion of patients with dementia shows a low baseline BIS. The utility of the BIS monitor in detecting dementia warrants further investigation.

However, the usefulness of a parameter derived from the electroencephalogram for clinical anesthesia largely depends on its ability to predict the response to stimuli of different intensity or painfulness under a combination of a hypnotic and an (opioid) analgesic. This study was designed to evaluate the predictive performance of spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), BIS, and approximate entropy for the response to increasingly intense stimuli under different concentrations of both propofol and remifentanil in the therapeutic range.
Ten healthy male and ten healthy female volunteers were studied during coadministration of propofol and remifentanil. After having maintained a specific target concentration for 10 min, the depth of sedation-anesthesia was assessed using the responsiveness component of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) rating scale, which was modified by adding insertion of a laryngeal mask and laryngoscopy. The electroencephalogram derived parameters approximate entropy, bispectral index, and SEF95 were recorded just before sedation level was assessed.
The prediction probability values for approximate entropy were slightly, but not significantly, better than those for bispectral index, SEF95, and the combination of drug concentrations. A much lower prediction ability was observed for tolerance of airway manipulation than for hypnotic endpoints.
Approximate entropy revealed informations on hypnotic and analgesic endpoints using coadministration of propofol and remifentanil comparable to bispectral index, SEF95, and the combination of drug concentrations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12606904/

Fifty patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy received combined epidural and general anesthesia or general anesthesia alone with isoflurane and alfentanil. Isoflurane was administered by computer-controlled closed-loop feedback to maintain an EEG 95% spectral edge frequency of 17.5 Hz, a target chosen on the basis of a pilot study. In epidural patients, end-tidal isoflurane concentration (FE'(ISO)) was 0.19% smaller (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.32% to -0.06%; P < 0.01), mean arterial blood pressure was 17 mm Hg lower (95% CI, -24 to -9 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), and body temperature was 0.4 degrees C lower (95% CI, -0.7 to 0 degrees C; P < 0.05) than in controls. EEG bispectral index (BIS) was 4 points higher (95% CI, 1 to 7; P < 0.05). EEG median frequency and heart rate were similar in both groups. Epidural patients were 76% more likely (95% CI, 58% to 94%; P < 0.001) to require metaraminol for hypotension and were 28% more likely (95% CI, 3% to 53%; P < 0.05) to require glycopyrrolate for bradycardia. After surgery, the time to eye opening in epidural patients was 2.3 min shorter (95% CI, -4.2 to -0.5 min; P < 0.05). Time to eye opening correlated better with FE'(ISO) in the last 30 s of anesthesia (FE'(ISO) = 0.07 x time to eye opening + 0.31; r(2) = 0.59; P < 0.0001) than with BIS from the same period (BIS = 64 - 1.25 x time to eye opening; r(2) = 0.22; P < 0.001) (P < 0.0001). To maintain similar intraoperative spectral edge frequency, patients receiving combined epidural and general anesthesia require 21% less isoflurane than those receiving general anesthesia alone. This smaller isoflurane dose is associated with faster emergence from anesthesia.
The dose of general anesthetic required to maintain similar intraoperative suppression of brain electrical activity is 21% less in patients with nerve blockade than in those without. This dose reduction results in faster waking times in patients with nerve blockade, which may reflect lighter intraoperative anesthesia.

Baseline values were defined with remifentanil 0.3 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) and target-controlled infusion of propofol 3.0 microg/mL. EEG changes were evaluated 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 min after the stop of remifentanil infusion, followed by a step-by-step reduction (0.2 microg/mL) every 3 min of target-controlled infusion propofol. Narcotrend (NT; classifying EEG stages from awake to deep anesthesia), bispectral index (BIS), EEG spectral frequency bands (%), 50% (Median) and 95% percentiles (spectral edge frequency), mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were detected at every time point. The end of remifentanil application resulted in significant increases in %alpha, spectral edge frequency, mean arterial blood pressure, and %theta and decreases in %delta (P < 0.05). NT, BIS, Median, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were unchanged. Decreases in propofol concentration were associated with statistically significant increases in NT and BIS (P < 0.05).

After Human Investigations Committee approval, 19 healthy ASA physical status I or II patients were enrolled in a prospective experimental design. Regional anesthesia was initiated and general anesthesia induced by using computer-assisted continuous infusion of propofol. Propofol was incrementally adjusted to a BIS of approximately 60. After 20 min at a stable propofol infusion rate, a remifentanil computer-assisted continuous infusion (effect-site target concentration of 0.5, 2.5, and then 10 ng/mL) was sequentially administered at stepped 15-min intervals. BIS decreased from 56 +/- 2 to 44 +/- 1, 95% spectral edge frequency from 17.9 +/- 0.5 Hz to 15.0 +/- 0.4 Hz, heart rate from 84 +/- 5 bpm to 62 +/- 4 bpm, and mean arterial blood pressure from 93 +/- 4 mm Hg to 69 +/- 3 mm Hg with increasing remifentanil concentration. A significant linear correlation between BIS, 95% spectral edge frequency, heart rate, and log (remifentanil effect-site) concentration was found.

Thirty-six patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I or II were recruited, of which 12 received a target remifentanil concentration of 0 ng/ml, eight 2 ng/ml, eight 4 ng/ml, and another eight 8 ng/ml. Next (before surgery), several step-wise changes in the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (F(ET,sevo)) were performed. A data acquisition system simultaneously recorded F(ET,sevo), the raw electroencephalogram, BIS, and SEF. The authors used a combination of an effect compartment and an inhibitory sigmoid E(MAX) model to describe the relation between F(ET,sevo) and BIS, SEF, and CUP. Model parameters (t(1/2)k(e0), E(MAX), E(MIN), C(50), gamma, CUP weight factors) were estimated using the population data analysis program NONMEM. Significant remifentanil model parameter dependencies (P < 0.01) were determined.
Determined from SEF, remifentanil had no effect on t(1/2)k(e0) (1.91 +/- 0.26 min [mean +/- standard error]) but caused an increase in C(50) (baseline = 1.48 +/- 0.12%; 80% increase at 8 ng/ml) and decrease in E(MIN) (baseline = 10.8 +/- 0.6 Hz; 80% reduction at 8 ng/ml). Determined from CUP, remifentanil caused a dose-dependent decrease in t(1/2)k(e0) (baseline = 4.31 +/- 1.00 min; 60% decrease at 8 ng/ml), with no effect on C(50) (baseline = 0.88 +/- 0.13%). Determined from BIS, remifentanil caused a dose-dependent decrease in t(1/2)k(e0) (baseline value = 3.11 +/- 0.32 min; 40% decrease at 8 ng/ml), without affecting C(50) (baseline = 1.12 +/- 0.05%).

We tested whether these signals could predict physiologic sleep stages, by taking processed electroencephalogram measurements and recording full polysomnography through a night's sleep in 10 subjects being investigated for mild sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. Computerized polysomnograph signals were analyzed manually according to standard criteria, classifying each 30-s epoch as a specific sleep stage. The BIS and SEF values were taken at the end of each period of sleep when the same stage had lasted for at least 2 min. Before sleep, median values for BIS were 97 +/- 12.1 and for SEF 23 +/- 4.2 Hz. After sleep initiation, the median BIS values for arousal, light, slow wave, and rapid eye movement sleep were 67 +/- 20.2, 50 +/- 16.5, 42 +/- 11.2, and 48 +/- 7.1, respectively, and the median SEF values were 20 +/- 4.7, 15 +/- 3.6, 10 +/- 2.6, and 19 +/- 4.1 Hz, respectively. Although both BIS and SEF decreased with increasing sleep depth, the distribution of values at each sleep depth was considerable, with overlap between each sleep stage. Neither BIS nor SEF reliably indicated conventionally determined sleep stages. In addition, the response of the BIS was slow and patients could arouse with low BIS values, which then took some time to increase.

Fourteen patients underwent hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (32 degrees C, group H), and 14 normothermic CPB (group N). The level of sedation was measured with Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Score and with Ramsay Sedation Score. BIS was the only EEG measurement that paralleled the clinical course of the patients' sedation level. Values (median, 95% confidence intervals (CI)) changed significantly over time in both groups (P<0.0001). In group H, BIS decreased from 97 (95, 99) the day before surgery to 48 (44, 52) after tracheal intubation, to 46 (41, 52) before going off CPB, to 91 (85, 97) immediately before extubation. In group N, values were 93 (91, 97) the day before surgery, 53 (47, 59) after tracheal intubation, 48 (43, 53) before going off CPB, and 90 (84, 96) before extubation. During CPB, BIS values were significantly different between the two groups. Group H had a median of 41 (95% CI, 39, 42), and group N had a median of 49 (95% CI, 48, 51, P<0.0001). Peak values of all other processed EEG parameters during anaesthesia and surgery overlapped with values from the day before, when patients had no sedating medication, and these values did not correlate to the patients' course of sedation during the study. There was no explicit recall of the surgery in either group. During the phases of anaesthesia and surgery without CPB, the progression of BIS levels was comparable with previously published data for non-cardiac surgery. During normothermic CPB, the highest BIS values were close to values representing insufficient depth of sedation. It remains to be elucidated whether the much lower BIS values in the hypothermic group were solely a result of brain cooling or if increased serum propofol concentrations, because of slowed pharmacodynamics during hypothermia, also contributed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11573582/

The goal of this investigation was to determine the time course of plasma concentration and the effects of propofol demonstrated by electroencephalogram or blood pressure changes and to compare them between elderly and young or middle-aged patients.
A target-controlled infusion was used to rapidly attain and maintain four sequentially increasing, randomly selected plasma propofol concentrations from 1 to 12 microg/ml in 41 patients aged 20-85 yr. The target concentration was maintained for about 30 min. Bispectral index (BIS), spectral edge frequency, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were used as measures of propofol effect. Because the time courses of these measures following the started drug infusion showed an exponential pattern, the first-order rate constant for equilibration of the effect site with the plasma concentration (k(eO)) was estimated by fitting a monoexponential model to the effect versus time data resulting from the pseudo-steady-state propofol plasma concentration profile.
The half-times for the plasma-effect-site equilibration for BIS were 2.31, 2.30, 2.29, and 2.37 min in patients aged 20-39, 40-59, 60-69, and 70-85 yr, respectively (n = 10 or 11 each). The half-times for SBP were 5.68, 5.92, 8.87, and 10.22 min in the respective age groups. All were significantly longer than for BIS (P < 0.05). The propofol concentration at half of the maximal decrease of SBP was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the elderly than in the younger patients.
The effect of propofol on BIS occurs more rapidly than its effect on SBP. Age has no effect on the rate of BIS reduction with increasing propofol concentration, whereas with increasing age, SBP decreases to a greater degree but more slowly.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10360846/
10319783,The dynamic relationship between end-tidal sevoflurane and isoflurane concentrations and bispectral index and spectral edge frequency of the electroencephalogram.,Anesthesiology,1999,"Olofsen E, Dahan A","Inhalational anesthetics produce dose-dependent effects on electroencephalogram-derived parameters, such as 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF) and bispectral index (BIS). The authors analyzed the relationship between end-tidal sevoflurane and isoflurane concentrations (FET) and BIS and SEF and determined the speed of onset and offset of effect (t1/2k(e0)).
Twenty-four patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II were randomly assigned to receive anesthesia with sevoflurane or isoflurane. Several transitions between 0.5 and 1.5 minimum alveolar concentration were performed. BIS and SEF data were analyzed with a combination of an effect compartment and an inhibitory sigmoid Emax model, characterized by t1/2k(e0), the concentration at which 50% depression of the electroencephalogram parameters occurred (IC50), and shape parameters. Parameter values estimated are mean +/- SD.
The model adequately described the FET-BIS relationship. Values for t1/2k(e0), derived from the BIS data, were 3.5 +/- 2.0 and 3.2 +/- 0.7 min for sevoflurane and isoflurane, respectively (NS). Equivalent values derived from SEF were 3.1 +/- 2.4 min (sevoflurane) and 2.3 +/- 1.2 min (isoflurane; NS). Values of t1/2k(e0) derived from the SEF were smaller than those from BIS (P < 0.05). IC50 values derived from the BIS were 1.14 +/- 0.31% (sevoflurane) and 0.60 +/- 0.11% (isoflurane; P < 0.05).
The speed of onset and offset of anesthetic effect did not differ between isoflurane and sevoflurane; isoflurane was approximately twice as potent as sevoflurane. The greater values of t1/2k(e0) derived from the BIS data compared with those derived from the SEF data may be related to computational and physiologic delays.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10319783/
10027031,The effect of ketamine on clinical endpoints of hypnosis and EEG variables during propofol infusion.,Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,1999,"Sakai T, Singh H, Mi WD, Kudo T, Matsuki A","We studied the effect of variable doses of ketamine on the endpoints of hypnosis, e.g., unresponsiveness to verbal commands (UVC), loss of eyelash reflex (LER), and inhibition of body movement response with or without sneezing to nasal membrane stimulation (INBMR), and processed EEG variables, e.g., bispectral index (BIS), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF) and median frequency (MF) during propofol infusion.
Forty-eight patients received either propofol infusion, 30 mg.kg-1.h-1 (Group P; n = 12) or ketamine bolus, 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 mg i.v., followed by propofol infusion, 30 mg.kg-1.h-1 + variable dose ketamine infusion, 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 mg.kg-1.h-1 (Groups PK0.25, PK0.5 and PK0.75; n = 12 each) until UVC, LER and INBMR. BIS, 95% SEF and MF values were monitored and recorded at the endpoints of hypnosis. Propofol and ketamine concentrations were measured at INBMR.
Propofol infusion, 30 mg.kg-1.h-1, induced UVC, LER and INBMR at BIS: 65 +/- 2, 63 +/- 9 and 33 +/- 7; 95% SEF: 17 +/- 3, 17 +/- 4 and 14 +/- 3; and MF values of 5 +/- 2, 5 +/- 3 and 3 +/- 2, respectively. With adjunctive ketamine (Groups PK0.5 and PK0.75), the hypnotic endpoints were achieved at higher BIS and 95% SEF values and lower propofol doses and concentrations as compared to Groups P and PK0.25 (9.9 +/- 5.8 and 9.4 +/- 3.4 vs. 13.4 +/- 4.5 and 14 +/- 5.8 micrograms.ml-1).
Our results suggest additive interaction between propofol and ketamine (Groups PK0.5 and PK0.75) for achieving the hypnotic endpoints; however, ketamine did not depress the EEG variables in proportion to its hypnotic effect. The paradoxically higher BIS and 95% SEF values at the hypnotic endpoints may be due to lower propofol concentrations and/or no effect of ketamine on the EEG variables.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10027031/
9743404,Bispectral EEG index during nitrous oxide administration.,Anesthesiology,1998,"Rampil IJ, Kim JS, Lenhardt R, Negishi C, Sessler DI","Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a commonly used sedative for painful diagnostic procedures and dental work. The authors sought to characterize the effects of N2O on quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) variables including the bispectral index (BIS), a quantitative parameter developed to correlate with the level of sedation induced by a variety of agents.
Healthy young adult volunteers (n = 13) were given a randomized sequence of N2O/O2 combinations via face mask. Five concentrations of N2O (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% atm) were administered for 15 min (20 min for the first step). EEG was recorded from bilateral frontal poles continuously. At the end of each exposure, level of sedation was assessed using primarily the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale.
One subject withdrew from the study because of emesis at 50% N2O. N2O (50%) increased theta, beta, 40-50 Hz, and 70-110 Hz band powers. BIS and spectral edge frequency during 50% N2O/O2 did not differ significantly from baseline values. Abrupt decreases from higher to lower concentrations frequently evoked a profound, transient slowing of activity. No significant change in OAA/S was detected during the study.
Although the spectral content of the EEG changed during N2O administration, reflecting some pharmacologic effect, the subjects remained cooperative and responsive throughout, and therefore N2O can only be considered a weak sedative at the tested concentrations. Despite changes in the lower and higher frequency ranges of EEG activity, the BIS did not change, which is consistent with its design objective as a specific measure of hypnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9743404/

Propofol was administered by using a target-controlled infusion at different propofol steady-state concentrations. All variables were measured simultaneously at specific calculated concentrations and endpoints.
Loss of consciousness was accurately monitored by BIS, SEMG and SEF 95%, and propofol drug effect by BIS only. Return of consciousness was predicted by BIS, MF and SEF 95%. Due to the biphasic EEG pattern of propofol and the lack of reproducible data at specific propofol concentrations, the clinical usefulness of SEF 95%, MF and RDELTA was very limited. SEMG was useful to detect loss and return of consciousness, but without predictive value.
The BIS might be an accurate measure to monitor depth of anaesthesia and hypnotic drug effect. Other neurophysiologic measures have limited value to monitor depth of anaesthesia and hypnotic drug effect.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9689266/

The current study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of three EEG parameters and anesthetic concentration for predicting depth of sedation and anesthesia during sevoflurane anesthesia
One low and one high equilibrated concentration ranging from 0.2-1.8% were assigned randomly and administered consecutively to 69 patients. The bispectral index (BIS; version 3.2), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), and median power frequency (MPF) were obtained from a bipolar frontomastoid (Fp1-A1, Fp2-A2) montage using an EEG monitor. Sedation was assessed using the responsiveness portion of the observer's assessment of alertness-sedation scale. In the second phase of the study, the 47 patients who were scheduled to have skin incisions were observed for purposeful movement in response to skin incision at sevoflurane concentrations between 1.6% and 2.4%. The relation among BIS, 95% SEF, MPF, sevoflurane concentration, sedation score, and movement or no movement after skin incision, was determined. Prediction probability values for EEG parameters and sevoflurane concentration to predict depth of sedation and anesthesia were also calculated.
The BIS and sevoflurane concentration correlated closely with the sedation score. Both 95% SEF and MPF changed significantly but biphasically with increasing sedation. The prediction probability values for BIS and sevoflurane concentration were 0.966 and 0.945, respectively, indicating a high predictive performance for depth of sedation. No EEG parameters predicted movement after skin incision better than chance alone.
Parameters derived from EEG, such as BIS, and 95% SEF are reliable guides to the depth of sedation, but not to the adequacy of anesthesia level for preventing movement during sevoflurane anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9523807/

We studied 12 patients undergoing hip or knee replacement under spinal anaesthesia. During periods of consciousness and unconsciousness, respective mean values for the four measurements were: AEP index, 60.8 (SD 13.7) and 37.6 (6.5); BIS, 85.1 (8.2) and 66.8 (10.5); SEF, 24.2 (2.2) and 18.7 (2.1); and MF, 10.9 (3.3) and 8.8 (2.0). Threshold values with a specificity of 100% for a state of unconsciousness were: AEP index, 37 (sensitivity 52%); BIS, 55 (sensitivity 15%); and SEF, 16.0 (sensitivity 9%). There was no recorded value for MF that was 100% specific for unconsciousness. Of the four measurements, only AEP index demonstrated a significant difference (P < 0.05) between all mean values 1 min before recovery of consciousness and all mean values 1 min after recovery of consciousness. Our findings suggest that of the four electrophysiological variables, AEP index was best at distinguishing the transition from unconsciousness to consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9505777/

Twenty four ASA I-II patients were randomized to receive either propofol infusion preceded by normal saline (group P, n = 12) or propofol preceded by 2 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl (group PF, n = 12). Intubation was performed five minutes after maintenance of BIS within 45 +/- 5. EEG and haemodynamic variables were recorded at before induction, and before and after intubation.
Haemodynamic responses to intubation were greater in group P than in group PF (P < 0.05). Postintubation SBP, DBP and HR increased, compared with preinduction values, more in group P than in group PF. Postintubation BIS values increased from 45.5 +/- 3.5 and 44.2 +/- 4.1 to 51.1 +/- 4.1 and 50.9 +/- 5.3 in groups P and PF, respectively, compared with preintubation values. The BIS values were not different between treatment groups before and after intubation, and 95% SEF and MF values did not increase after intubation.
Fentanyl, 2 micrograms.kg-1 i.v., blunted the haemodynamic responses to intubation, but failed to attenuate the arousal of cerebral cortical activity. The different haemodynamic responses postintubation but similar BIS and 95% SEF changes in the two groups suggest that BIS or 95% SEF cannot predict the haemodynamic responses to intubation during anaesthesia induction with propofol and fentanyl.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9466021/

Each variable was recorded simultaneously at 10 periods during anaesthesia. All four variables were not affected by the transition to CPB. During hypothermia, values of AEPIndex, MF and SEF were tightly distributed but values of BIS were very variable and overlapped with those before induction of anaesthesia. The variability decreased during rewarming. The values of AEPIndex throughout the anaesthesia never overlapped with those before induction of anaesthesia.

This prospective study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the BIS index and 95% SEF for assessing the level of propofol-induced sedation and amnesia during regional anesthesia. Ten consenting adult patients undergoing surgery with regional anesthesia were administered propofol in increments of 10-20 mg i.v., every 5-10 min until they became unresponsive to tactile stimulation (i.e., mild prodding or shaking). The BIS index and 95% SEF were continuously recorded from a bifrontal montage (Fp1-Cz and Fp2-Cz) using the Aspect B500 monitor. The depth of sedation was assessed clinically at 5- to 10-min intervals using the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale, with 1 = no response to tactile stimulation to 5 = wide awake. Each patient was shown a picture of an animal (cat) prior to administration of an initial dose of propofol, 40 mg i.v.. Subsequently, patients were administered intermittent bolus doses of propofol, 10-20 mg i.v., and shown different pictures upon achieving OAA/S scores of 4, 3, and 2 during the onset of and recovery from propofol-induced sedation. Picture recall was tested upon arrival of the patient in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Of the two EEG variables studied, the BIS index exhibited a better correlation with the OAA/S scores during both the onset (Spearman's rho = 0.744) and recovery (Spearman's rho = 0.705) phases of propofol-induced sedation. With the increasing depth of sedation, there was a progressive decrease in the BIS index (OAA/S score of 5, BIS = 94.5 +/- 2.9; 4, 93.3 +/- 3.3; 3, 89 +/- 6.1; 2, 80.1 +/- 8.7; 1, 75.6 +/- 7.5; mean +/- SD). Conversely, there was a progressive increase in the BIS value during recovery from propofol sedation (OAA/S score of 1, BIS = 75.6 +/- 7.5; 2, 82.4 +/- 10.5; 3, 84.9 +/- 5.9; 4, 93.8 +/- 0.8). Although the changes in the 95% SEF values were less consistent during the onset phase, this EEG variable increased from 16.4 +/- 5.0 to 19.3 +/- 5.6 as the OAA/S score increased from 1 to 4 during the recovery phase. Patient recall of the intraoperative pictures decreased with increasing depth of sedation and decreasing BIS values (OAA/S:% BIS:% recall = 5:94.5 +/- 2.9:100%; 4:93.4 +/- 3:63%; 3:87.3 +/- 6.1:40%; 2:80.8 +/- 8.3:0%; 1:75.6 +/- 7.5:0%). The BIS index appears to be a useful variable for assessing the depth of propofol-induced sedation.

A total of 42 consenting patients were assigned to 3 groups, isoflurane 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC). Anesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained with the appropriate end-tidal concentration of isoflurane. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using a microcomputer system, and data were analyzed off-line. The EEG during the 2 min before incision was analyzed. Following skin incision, each patient was carefully observed for 60 sec to detect occurrence of purposeful movement.
For all groups combined, there was a statistically significant difference for BIS (p < 0.0001) and also for relative delta power (p < 0.016) between movers and nonmovers. There was a statistically significant difference between movers and nonmovers at 1.25 MAC isoflurane for BIS (p < 0.01). There were no other significant differences for any other EEG variable at any concentration of isoflurane. No EEG variable showed a relationship to isoflurane concentration.
When bispectral analysis of the EEG was used to develop a retrospectively determined index, there was an association of the index with movement. Thus, it may be a useful predictor of whether patients will move in response to skin incision during anesthesia with isoflurane/oxygen.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7760092/
