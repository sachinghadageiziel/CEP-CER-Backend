Despite its importance, indications for surfactant therapy are often based on oversimplified criteria. Lung biology and modern monitoring provide several diagnostic tools to assess the patient surfactant status and they can be used for a personalized surfactant therapy. This is desirable to improve the efficacy of surfactant treatment and reduce associated costs and side effects. In this review we will discuss these diagnostic tools from a pathophysiological and multi-disciplinary perspective, focusing on the quantitative or qualitative surfactant assays, lung mechanics or aeration measurements, and gas exchange metrics. Their biological and technical characteristics are described with practical information for clinicians. Finally, available evidence-based data are reviewed, and the diagnostic accuracy of the different tools is compared. Lung ultrasound seems the most suitable tool for assessing the surfactant status, while some other promising tests require further research and/or development.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38016825/

This depends on the variable extent of alveolar recruitment. The recruitment-to-inflation ratio estimates recruitability across a 10-cm H2O PEEP range through a simplified maneuver. Whether recruitability is uniform or not across this range is unknown. The hypotheses of this study are that the recruitment-to-inflation ratio represents an accurate estimate of PEEP-induced changes in dynamic strain, but may show nonuniform behavior across the conventionally tested PEEP range (15 to 5 cm H2O).
Twenty patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome underwent a decremental PEEP trial (PEEP 15 to 13 to 10 to 8 to 5 cm H2O). Respiratory mechanics and end-expiratory lung volume by nitrogen dilution were measured the end of each step. Gas exchange, recruited volume, recruitment-to-inflation ratio, and changes in dynamic, static, and total strain were computed between 15 and 5 cm H2O (global recruitment-to-inflation ratio) and within narrower PEEP ranges (granular recruitment-to-inflation ratio).
Between 15 and 5 cm H2O, median [interquartile range] global recruitment-to-inflation ratio was 1.27 [0.40 to 1.69] and displayed a linear correlation with PEEP-induced dynamic strain reduction (r = -0.94; P < 0.001). Intraindividual recruitment-to-inflation ratio variability within the narrower ranges was high (85% [70 to 109]). The relationship between granular recruitment-to-inflation ratio and PEEP was mathematically described by a nonlinear, quadratic equation (R2 = 0.96). Granular recruitment-to-inflation ratio across the narrower PEEP ranges itself had a linear correlation with PEEP-induced reduction in dynamic strain (r = -0.89; P < 0.001).
Both global and granular recruitment-to-inflation ratio accurately estimate PEEP-induced changes in lung dynamic strain. However, the effect of 10 cm H2O of PEEP on lung strain may be nonuniform. Granular recruitment-to-inflation ratio assessment within narrower PEEP ranges guided by end-expiratory lung volume measurement may aid more precise PEEP selection, especially when the recruitment-to-inflation ratio obtained with the simplified maneuver between PEEP 15 and 5 cm H2O yields intermediate values that are difficult to interpret for a proper choice between a high and low PEEP strategy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37523486/

Our aim was to identify health system-level lessons from implementing two automated RR counters, Children's Automated Respiration Monitor (ChARM) by Phillips
Key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with 57 participants (health workers in communities and facilities, trainers of health workers, district management, and key decision-makers) in five regions of Ethiopia. Data were analyzed in ATLAS.ti using thematic content analysis and themes were categorized using the Tanahashi bottleneck analysis.
All participants recommended scaling up the ARIDA initiative nationally as part of Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) in primary healthcare. Health workers perceived the devices as: time saving, acceptable by parents and children, and facilitating diagnosis and referrals. Health workers perceived an increased demand for services and reduced numbers of sick children not seeking care. Participants recommended increasing the number of devices distributed and health workers trained. Strengthening drug supply chains, improving oxygen gas availability, and strengthening referral networks would maximize perceived benefits. While training improved knowledge, more supportive supervision, integration with current guidelines and more guidance related to community engagement was recommended.
Automatic RR counters for the decentralized diagnosis of childhood pneumonia could have positive impact on improving the quality of diagnosis and management of pneumonia in children.

However, a high Fio2 is not physiologic and may lead to various complications. We hypothesized that continuous titration of Fio2 using the oxygen reserve index (ORI) reduces oxygen exposure compared to conventional management during OLV.
In this randomized, double-blinded trial, patients undergoing thoracic surgery were assigned to an ORI (n = 64) or a control group (n = 60). In the ORI group, ORI was continuously displayed using multiwavelength pulse co-oximetry (Masimo) between 0 and 1 (0, no reserve; 1, maximum reserve), and Fio2 was titrated for a target ORI of 0.21 at 5-minute intervals during OLV. In the control group, Fio2 was adjusted using arterial blood gas analysis measured at 15 minutes after OLV initiation. The primary end point was the time-weighted average Fio2 during OLV.
Overall, time-weighted average Fio2 did not differ between the groups (control versus ORI: median [interquartile range], 0.87 [0.73-1.00] vs 0.82 [0.68-0.93]; P = .09). However, in a subgroup analysis, the ORI group reduced time-weighted average Fio2 after pulmonary vascular ligation compared to the control group (control versus ORI: median [interquartile range], 0.75 [0.70-1.00] vs 0.72 [0.59-0.89]; P = .0261).

Time required for blood sampling and analysis may cause Hb measurement to lag clinical conditions, thus continuous intraoperative Hb trend monitoring may provide useful information. This multicenter study was designed to compare three methods of determining intraoperative Hb changes (trend accuracy) to laboratory determined Hb changes. Adult surgical patients with planned arterial catheterization were studied. With each blood gas analysis performed, pulse cooximetry hemoglobin (SpHb) was recorded, and arterial blood Hb was measured by hematology (tHb), arterial blood gas cooximetry (ABGHb), and point of care (aHQHb) analyzers. Hb change was calculated and trend accuracy assessed by modified Bland-Altman analysis. Secondary measures included Hb measurement change direction agreement. Trend accuracy mean bias (95% limits of agreement; g/dl) for SpHb was 0.10 (- 1.14 to 1.35); for ABGHb was - 0.02 (- 1.06 to 1.02); and for aHQHb was 0.003 (- 0.95 to 0.95).

There are no reliable estimates of methemoglobinemia in low resource clinical settings. Our objectives were to: i) evaluate risk factors for methemoglobinemia in Ugandan children hospitalized with fever (study 1); and ii) investigate MHb responses in critically ill Ugandan children with severe malaria treated with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), an oxidant that induces MHb in a dose-dependent manner (study 2).
Two prospective studies were conducted at Jinja Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda between 2011 and 2013. Study 1, a prospective cohort study of children admitted to hospital with fever (fever cohort, n = 2089 children 2 months to 5 years). Study 2, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel arm trial of room air placebo vs. 80 ppm iNO as an adjunctive therapy for children with severe malaria (RCT, n = 180 children 1-10 years receiving intravenous artesunate and 72 h of study gas). The primary outcomes were: i) masimo pulse co-oximetry elevated MHb levels at admission (>2 %, fever cohort); ii) four hourly MHb levels in the RCT.
In the fever cohort, 34 % of children admitted with fever had elevated MHb at admission. Children with a history of vomiting, delayed capillary refill, elevated lactate, severe anemia, malaria, or hemoglobinopathies had increased odds of methemoglobinemia (p < 0.05 in a multivariate model). MHb levels at admission were higher in children who died (n = 89) compared to those who survived (n = 1964), p = 0.008. Among children enrolled in the iNO RCT, MHb levels typically plateaued within 12-24 h of starting study gas. MHb levels were higher in children receiving iNO compared to placebo, and MHb > 10 % occurred in 5.7 % of children receiving iNO. There were no differences in rates of study gas discontinuation between trial arms.
Hospitalized children with evidence of impaired oxygen delivery, metabolic acidosis, anemia, or malaria were at risk of methemoglobinemia. However, we demonstrated high-dose iNO could be safely administered to critically ill children with severe malaria with appropriate MHb monitoring.

These probes are calibrated in healthy adult volunteers between arterial saturations of ~75 and 100%, using the gold standard of co-oximetry on arterial blood samples. There are little data to attest their accuracy in cyanotic congenital heart disease. Aims We aimed to assess the accuracy of a commonly used probe in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease.
Children with cyanotic congenital heart disease admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit with an arterial line in situ were included to our study. Prospective simultaneous recordings of SpO2, measured by the Masimo SET® LNCS Neo peripheral probe, and co-oximeter saturations (SaO2) measured by arterial blood gas analysis were recorded.
A total of 527 paired measurements of SpO2 and SaO2 (using an ABL800 FLEX analyser) in 25 children were obtained. The mean bias of the pulse oximeter for all SaO2 readings was +4.7±13.8%. The wide standard deviation indicates poor precision. This mean bias increased to +7.0±13.7% at SaO2 recordings <75%. The accuracy root mean square of the recordings was 3.30% across all saturation levels, and this increased to 4.98% at SaO2 <75%.
The performance of the Masimo SET® LNCS Neo pulse oximeter is poor when arterial oxyhaemoglobin saturations are below 75%. It tends to overestimate saturations in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease. This may have serious implications for clinical decisions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26471067/

When oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2) overestimates SaO2, hypoxemia may be overlooked. We compared the SpO2 - SaO2 differences among three pulse oximeters in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) who spent their daily lives in a poor oxygen state.
This prospective observational study recruited 32 patients with CTEPH undergoing elective cardiac catheterization. As we collected arterial blood samples in the catheter laboratory, SpO2 values were simultaneously recorded. Three pulse oximeters were used on each patient, and SpO2 values were compared with oximetry readings using a blood gas analyzer. To determine the optimal SpO2 value by which to detect hypoxemia (SaO2≦90%), we generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for each pulse oximeter.
The root mean square of each pulse oximeter was 1.79 (OLV-3100), 1.64 (N-BS), and 2.50 (Masimo Radical). The mean bias (SpO2 - SaO2) for the 90%-95% saturation range was significantly higher for Masimo Radical (0.19 +/- 1.78% [OLV-3100], 0.18 +/- 1.63% [N-BS], and 1.61 +/- 1.91% [Masimo Radical]; p<0.0001). The optimal SpO2 value to detect hypoxemia (SaO2≦90%) was 89% for OLV-3100, 90% for N-BS, and 92% for Masimo Radical.
We found that the biases and precision with which to detect hypoxemia differed among the three pulse oximeters. To avoid hypoxemia, the optimal SpO2 should be determined for each pulse oximeter.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25978517/

The etiology may be related to leukocyte antibodies or biologically active compounds in transfused plasma, injuring susceptible recipient's lungs. The authors have hypothesized that transfusion could have less severe effects that are not always appreciated clinically and have shown subtly decreased pulmonary oxygen gas transfer in healthy volunteers after transfusion of fresh and 21-day stored erythrocytes. In this study, the authors tested the same hypothesis in surgical patients.
Ninety-one patients undergoing elective major spine surgery with anticipated need for erythrocyte transfusion were randomly allocated to receive their first transfusion of erythrocytes as cell salvage (CS), washed stored, or unwashed stored. Clinicians were not blinded to group assignment. Pulmonary gas transfer and mechanics were measured 5 min before and 30 min after erythrocyte transfusion.
The primary outcome variable, gas transfer, as assessed by change of PaO2/FIO2, with erythrocyte transfusion was not significant in any group (mean ± SD; CS: 9 ± 59; washed: 10 ± 26; and unwashed: 15 ± 1) and did not differ among groups (P = 0.92). Pulmonary dead space (VD/VT) decreased with CS transfusion (-0.01 ± 0.04; P = 0.034) but did not change with other erythrocytes; the change from before to after erythrocyte transfusion did not differ among groups (-0.01 to +0.01; P = 0.28).

Patients who underwent elective Le Fort I osteotomy and bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSO) were enrolled in this observational prospective cohort study. SpHb was compared with time-matched arterial total hemoglobin (tHb) before incision, at Le Fort I osteotomy, at BSSO, and at skin closure.

In this study, we evaluated a new acoustic ventilatory rate monitoring technology for accuracy, precision, reliability, and the ability to detect pauses in ventilation, relative to capnometry and a reference method in postsurgical patients.
Adult patients presenting to the postanesthesia care unit were connected to a Pulse CO-Oximeter with acoustic monitoring technology (Rad-87, version 7804, Masimo, Irvine, CA) through an adhesive bioacoustic sensor (RAS-125, rev C) applied to the neck. Each subject also wore a nasal cannula connected to a bedside capnometer (Capnostream20, version 4.5, Oridion, Needham, MA). The acoustic monitor and capnometer were connected to a computer for continuous acoustic and expiratory carbon dioxide waveform recordings. Recordings were retrospectively analyzed by a trained technician in a setting that allowed for the simultaneous viewing of both waveforms while listening to the breathing sounds from the acoustic signal to determine inspiration and expiration reference markers within the ventilatory cycle without using the acoustic monitor- or capnometer-calculated ventilatory rate. This allowed the automatic calculation of a reference ventilatory rate for each device through a software program (TagEditor, Masimo). Accuracy (relative to the respective reference) and precision of each device were estimated and compared with each other. Sensitivity for detection of pauses in ventilation, defined as no inspiration or expiration activity in the reference ventilatory cycle for ≥30 seconds, was also determined. The devices were also evaluated for their reliability, i.e., the percentage of the time when each displayed a value and did not drop a measurement.
Thirty-three adults (73% female) with age of 45 ± 14 years and weight 117 ± 42 kg were enrolled. A total of 3712 minutes of monitoring time (average 112 minutes per subject) were analyzed across the 2 devices, reference ventilatory rates ranged from 1.9 to 49.1 bpm. Acoustic monitoring showed significantly greater accuracy (P = 0.0056) and precision (P- = 0.0024) for respiratory rate as compared with capnometry. On average, both devices displayed data over 97% of the monitored time. The (0.95, 0.95) lower tolerance limits for the acoustic monitor and capnometer were 94% and 84%, respectively. Acoustic monitoring was marginally more sensitive (P = 0.0461) to pauses in ventilation (81% vs 62%) in 21 apneic events.
In this study of a population of postsurgical patients, the acoustic monitor and capnometer both reliably monitored ventilatory rate. The acoustic monitor was statistically more accurate and more precise than the capnometer, but differences in performance were modest. It is not known whether the observed differences are clinically significant. The acoustic monitor was more sensitive to detecting pauses in ventilation. Acoustic monitoring may provide an effective and convenient means of monitoring ventilatory rate in postsurgical patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23632055/

A sensor combining a pulse oximeter with the Stow-Severinghaus electrode, required for the measurement of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PtcCO(2)), respectively, has been recently used in neonatal clinical practice (TOSCA(500Ò)Radiometer). We evaluated TOSCA usability and reliability in the delivery room (DR), throughout three different periods, on term, late-preterm, and preterm neonates. During the first period (period A), 30 healthy term neonates were simultaneously monitored with both TOSCA and a MASIMO pulse oximeter. During the second period (period B), 10 healthy late-preterm neonates were monitored with both TOSCA and a transcutaneous device measuring PtcCO(2) (TINA(Ò) TCM3, Radiometer). During the third period (period C), 15 preterm neonates were monitored with TOSCA and MASIMO after birth, during stabilization, and during transport to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Blood gas analyses were performed to compare transcutaneous and blood gas values. TOSCA resulted easily and safely usable in the DR, allowing reliable noninvasive SaO(2) estimation. Since PtcCO(2) measurements with TOSCA required at least 10 min to be stable and reliable, this parameter was not useful during the early resuscitation immediately after birth. Moreover, PtcCO(2) levels were less precise if compared to the conventional transcutaneous monitoring. However, PtcCO(2) measurement by TOSCA was useful as trend-monitoring after stabilization and during transport to NICU.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112642/

We compared SpHb with invasive satellite-lab haemoglobin monitoring (Hb(satlab)) during major hepatic resections both under steady-state conditions and in a dynamic phase with fluid administration of crystalloid and colloid solutions.
Thirty patients undergoing major hepatic resection were included and randomized to receive a fluid bolus of 15 ml kg(-1) colloid (n=15) or crystalloid (n=15) solution over 30 min. SpHb was continuously measured on the index finger, and venous blood samples were analysed in both the steady-state phase (from induction until completion of parenchymal transection) and the dynamic phase (during fluid bolus).
Correlation was significant between SpHb and Hb(satlab) (R(2)=0.50, n=543). The modified Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measurements showed a bias (precision) of -0.27 (1.06) and -0.02 (1.07) g dl(-1) for the steady-state and dynamic phases, respectively. SpHb accuracy increased when Hb(satlab) was <10 g dl(-1), with a bias (precision) of 0.41 (0.47) vs -0.26 (1.12) g dl(-1) for values >10 g dl(-1), but accuracy decreased after colloid administration (R(2)=0.25).
SpHb correlated moderately with Hb(satlab) with a slight underestimation in both phases in patients undergoing major hepatic resection. Accuracy increased for lower Hb(satlab) values but decreased in the presence of colloid solution. Further improvements are necessary to improve device accuracy under these conditions, so that SpHb might become a sensitive screening device for clinically significant anaemia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22822043/

Data from the joint Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CO poisoning surveillance system from August 2008 to July 2011 were analyzed. Of 1711 cases of CO poisoning treated with hyperbaric oxygen in the United States and reported through the system, 1606 had their initial carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level measured by laboratory CO-oximetry and 105 by pulse CO-oximetry. Patients were selected from the laboratory CO-oximetry group to match each of the 105 patients evaluated by pulse CO-oximetry in 5 characteristics--age, sex, race/ethnicity, intent of poisoning, and occurrence of loss of consciousness. Measures of timeliness in measurement and management were compared between the 2 groups.
Patients with initial COHb measurement by pulse CO-oximetry had significantly shorter time to measurement of COHb, higher average levels of COHb, and shorter time from the end of CO exposure to the initiation of hyperbaric oxygen treatment. On average, patients evaluated by pulse CO-oximetry reached the hyperbaric chamber 1 hour faster than did patients evaluated by laboratory CO-oximetry (P < .01).

Thus, the objective of this trial is to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the Rad-57 pulse CO-oximeter by comparing it with venous sampling on the same subjects. Nine healthy subjects were subjected to carbon monoxide such that it raised the COHb to 10-14% on two different days and pooled together. The COHb and MetHb were measured with a blood gas-analyzer and simultaneously with the Rad-57 as the COHb increased from 1.4 to 14%.

Twenty patients undergoing major thoracic and lumbar spine surgery were recruited. All patients received radial arterial lines. On the contralateral index finger, a R1 25 sensor (Rev E) was applied and connected to a Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter (both Masimo Corp, Irvine, CA).

The preliminary results of an observational prospective study were reported. Newborns with GA ≤ 27 weeks requiring elective HFOV for a diagnosis of RDS were studied within the first 6 hours of life using RIP technology, before surfactant instillation. HFOV was performed with Draeger Babylog 8000 plus ventilator with ""optimum lung volume strategy ""(continuous distending pressure (CDP) increased step-by-step until FiO(2) ≤ 0.25 was reached). Data on ventilator settings, gas exchange and RIP volume were collected and analyzed. The analysis package used in this study visualizes measured data from the Bicore-II device (CareFusion), Pulse Oximeter Masimo, AX300 FiO(2) monitor device and TCM4 shuttle (TCM4, Radiometer, Copenaghen, Denmark).
Four preterm infants (two females) with mean ± SD gestational age of 26.5 ± 1.0 weeks and mean ± SD birth weight of 978 ± 188 grams were studied. Relative FRC slightly increased during the first steps of the recruitment phase, while deeply decreased at higher CDP values (≥ 15 cm H(2)O). Notwithstanding FiO(2) decreased until 0.25 in all the newborns except one.
Because RIP cannot differentiate between changes in lung fluid or intrathoracic gas, we hypothesized that as CDP increases and total lung capacity is approached, pulmonary vascular resistance increases as a consequence of the compression of intra-alveolar vessels. This increases right ventricular afterload which, combined with re-establishment of right-to left shunting, results in decreased pulmonary blood flow and then decreased lung volume. Caution should then be used when using high CDP values during the recruitment procedure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21888522/

In patients referred to our university hospital for D(LCO) testing, we simultaneously took arterial blood gas samples and measured Hb and COHb with the RAD-57 (SpHb and SpCOHb, respectively). We analyzed the paired values and the Hb-adjusted and COHb-adjusted predicted D(LCO) values with t tests and Bland-Altman plots. We compared the differences in predicted D(LCO) to a clinical threshold of 3 mL/min/mm Hg.
SpHb differed from Hb measured via arterial blood analysis (12.1 ± 2.4 g/dL vs 13.3 ± 2.1 g/dL, P < .001). SpCOHb did not differ significantly from COHb (ie, measured via arterial blood analysis) (2.1 ± 4.0 vs 2.5 ± 2.3, P = .25), but there was wide variability. There were small but statistically significant differences in the adjusted predicted D(LCO), depending on whether blood or pulse oximetry values were used. Predicted D(LCO) adjusted for both Hb and COHb was 22.5 ± 4.8 mL/min/mm Hg measured with the RAD-57 and 23.5 ± 4.5 mL/min/mm Hg via arterial blood analysis (P < .001). The limits of agreement for pulse oximetry adjusted D(LCO) exceeded the clinical threshold of 3 mL/min/mm Hg for Hb adjustments and combined Hb + COHb. Predicted D(LCO) values differed by > 3 mL/min/mm Hg in 17% of patients.

Whether pulse oximeters that attenuate motion artifact are less prone to such discrepancies is not well known.
To prospectively assess the agreement of the Masimo V4 pulse oximeter within the critical 85-95% SpO(2) target range.
For all consecutive babies with gestational age <33 weeks, postnatal age <7 days, and an umbilical arterial line, SpO(2) was measured continuously and SaO(2) analyzed on an as-needed basis. Bland-Altman techniques provided estimates of the difference (D = SaO(2) - SpO(2)), standard deviation (SD), and 95% limits of agreement (D ± 2*SD).
There were 1,032 measurements (114 babies) with SpO(2) between 85 and 95%. The 95% limits of agreement were -2.0 ± 5.8, -2.4 ± 9.2, and -1.9 ± 5.3 in the SpO(2) categories 85-95, 85-89, and 91-95%, respectively. For the SpO(2) categories 85-89% and 91-95%, only 52% (53/101) and 59% (523/886) of SpO(2) values, respectively, corresponded to the analogous SaO(2) categories. In the 85-89% SpO(2) category, SaO(2) was lower than 85% in 39 of the 101 (39%) measurements.
SaO(2) was lower on average than SpO(2) with an increased bias at lower saturation. The -2.4 ± 9.2 95% limits of agreement for SaO(2) - SpO(2) in the 85-89% SpO(2) category suggest that SpO(2) and SaO(2) are not interchangeable and intermittent SaO(2) assessments are warranted when the targeted SpO(2) is within this range.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21791935/

Prospective study.
Surgical intensive care unit of a university teaching hospital.
Sixty-two patients continuously monitored with Pulse CO-Oximetry (Masimo Radical-7).
None.
Four hundred seventy-one blood samples were analyzed by a point-of-care device (HemoCue 301), a satellite lab CO-Oximeter (Siemens RapidPoint 405), and a laboratory hematology analyzer (Sysmex XT-2000i), which was considered the reference device. Hemoglobin values reported from the invasive methods were compared to the values reported by the Pulse CO-Oximeter at the time of blood draw. When the case-to-case variation was assessed, the bias and limits of agreement were 0.0±1.0 g/dL for the Pulse CO-Oximeter, 0.3±1.3g/dL for the point-of-care device, and 0.9±0.6 g/dL for the satellite lab CO-Oximeter compared to the reference method. Pulse CO-Oximetry showed similar trend accuracy as satellite lab CO-Oximetry, whereas the point-of-care device did not appear to follow the trend of the laboratory analyzer as well as the other test devices.
When compared to laboratory reference values, hemoglobin measurement with Pulse CO-Oximetry has absolute accuracy and trending accuracy similar to widely used, invasive methods of hemoglobin measurement at bedside. Hemoglobin measurement with pulse CO-Oximetry has the additional advantages of providing continuous measurements, noninvasively, which may facilitate hemoglobin monitoring in the intensive care unit.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21666449/

The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of different new-generation pulse oximeters during intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy.
In the experimental setting, the validity of three pulse oximetry technologies (Masimo Radical 7, Nellcor N-600 and Datex Ohmeda TruSat) was evaluated in patients with IABP treatment. Arterial blood gas analysis (BGA-SaO2) data were compared with the pulse oximetric values (SpO2) during 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 support ratio.
The mean differences (bias) during 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 IABP support between BGA-SaO2 and Datex-SpO2 were 3.38% [95% confidence intervals (CI):±1.39%], 1.41% (95% CI 1.14%) and 2.10% (95% CI:±0.94%), respectively. Between BGA-SaO2 and Nellcor-SpO2, a bias of 0.77% (95% CI:±0.46%), 0.85% (95% CI:±0.40%) and 0.59% (95% CI:±0.38%) was found.

In patients with IABP support, the pulse oximetric values of the Masimo Radical 7 are accurate in 1:2 and 1:3 support ratio compared with blood gas analysis. In these support ratios, the Masimo Radical 7 is superior to the Nellcor N-600.

The aim of the present study is to compare hemoglobin concentration values obtained with a portable totally noninvasive device, the Masimo Labs Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter, with the results obtained by the ADVIA 2120 in the laboratory.
This was a prospective monocentric open trial enrolling patients consulting in the emergency department of a university hospital from June 16 to December 17, 2009. The main outcome measure was the agreement between both methods and evaluation of the percentage of potential decision error for transfusion.
Samples from 300 consecutive patients were assessed. Hemoglobin concentration could not be obtained with the new device for 24 patients. In others, the mean bias, the lower and the upper limits of agreement between the 2 methods, was 1.8 g/dL (95% estimated confidence interval [CI] 1.5 to 2.1 g/dL), -3.3 g/dL (95% CI -3.8 to -2.8 g/dL), and 6.9 g/dL (95% CI 6.4 to 7.4 g/dL), respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.53 (estimated 95% CI 0.10 to 0.74). The number of potential errors about transfusion decision was 38 (13% of patients).

20007731,Accuracy of methemoglobin detection by pulse CO-oximetry during hypoxia.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2010,"Feiner JR, Bickler PE, Mannheimer PD","Methemoglobin in the blood cannot be detected by conventional pulse oximetry, although it can bias the oximeter's estimate (Spo2) of the true arterial functional oxygen saturation (Sao2). A recently introduced ""Pulse CO-Oximeter"" (Masimo Rainbow SET(R) Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter, Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA) is intended to additionally monitor noninvasively the fractional carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin content in blood. The purpose of our study was to determine whether hypoxia affects the new device's estimated methemoglobin reading accuracy, and whether the presence of methemoglobin impairs the ability of the Radical-7 and a conventional pulse oximeter (Nonin 9700, Nonin Medical Inc., Plymouth, MN) to detect decreases in Sao2.
Eight and 6 healthy adults were included in 2 study groups, respectively, each fitted with multiple sensors and a radial arterial catheter for blood sampling. In the first group, IV administration of approximately 300 mg sodium nitrite increased subjects' methemoglobin level to a 7% to 8% target and hypoxia was induced to different levels of Sao2 (70%-100%) by varying fractional inspired oxygen. In the second group, 15% methemoglobin at room air and 80% Sao2 were targeted. Pulse CO-oximeter readings were compared with arterial blood values measured using a Radiometer multiwavelength hemoximeter. Pulse CO-oximeter methemoglobin reading performance was analyzed by observing the incidence of meaningful reading errors at the various hypoxia levels. This was used to determine the impact on predictive values for detecting methemoglobinemia. Spo2 reading bias, precision, and root mean square error were evaluated during conditions of elevated methemoglobin.
Observations spanned 66.2% to 99% Sao2 and 0.6% to 14.4% methemoglobin over the 2 groups (170 blood draws). Masimo methemoglobin reading bias and precision over the full Sao2 span was 7.7% +/- 13.0%. Best accuracy was found in the 95% to 100% Sao2 range (1.9% +/- 2.5%), progressing to its worst in the 70% to 80% range (24.8% +/- 15.6%). Occurrence of methemoglobin readings in error >5% increased over each 5-point decrease in Sao2 (P < 0.05). Masimo Spo2 readings were biased -6.3% +/- 3.0% in the 95% to 100% Sao2 range with 4% to 8.3% methemoglobin. Both the Radical-7 and Nonin 9700 pulse oximeters accurately detected decreases in Sao(2) <90% with 4% to 15% methemoglobin, despite displaying low Spo2 readings when Sao2 was >95%.
The Radical-7's methemoglobin readings become progressively more inaccurate as Sao2 decreases <95%, at times overestimating true values by 10% to 40%. Elevated methemoglobin causes the Spo2 readings to underestimate Sao2 similar to conventional 2-wavelength pulse oximeters at high saturation. Spo2 readings from both types of instruments continue to trend downward during the development of hypoxemia (Sao2 <90%) with methemoglobin levels up to 15%.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20007731/

The main disadvantage of BGA with COHb testing is the unavailability in pre-hospital rescue conditions. The non-invasive SpCO analysis using pulse CO oximetry (Rad57, Masimo Corp., USA) represents an easy-to-handle device to facilitate the diagnosis of CO intoxication. Between January 2006 and August 2008, 20 patients who were admitted with CO intoxication to our burn centre were included in this study. Blood gas analysis including COHb testing was performed on the first day, hourly. At the same time, SpCO was determined using the Rad57 pulse CO oximeter. Patients received inhalative oxygen according to the parameters of blood gas analysis or hyperbaric oxygenation if COHb > 10%. Five young healthy volunteers served as control group. The SpCO of the volunteers was cross-checked against their COHb levels, which were measured by blood gas analysis. Results of pulse CO oximetry revealed a mean error of approximately 3.15% from the results achieved by blood gas analysis. If COHb resulted in values higher than 10%, the bias remained approximately the same (3.43%/precision 2.362%). When different blood gas analyzers in our department were tested with the same patient sample, a mean error of 2.4% was found. This is only 1% lower compared to the mean error of pulse CO oximetry. Therefore, pulse CO oximetry represents a reliable measurement technique that is easy to handle and could facilitate the early diagnosis of CO intoxication in pre-hospital rescue conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19852557/

In various clinical situations, however, conventional devices may be unable to display valid values or any value whatsoever. The usefulness of the Signal Extraction Technology (SET) in these situations has not yet been investigated.
Twenty-five adult patients requiring norepinephrine, regardless of the reason or dosage, or having a defective signal with a conventional oximeter were equipped with both their conventional saturation sensor (Oxymax Nellcor) and a SET saturation sensor (Masimo) connected to its monitor. Saturation values displayed by each pulse oximeter and the SaO(2) measured concomitantly by cooximetry were gathered on inclusion and then whenever one of the two sensors did not display a value, or when the difference between the values was greater than five saturation points, or at any time a blood gas analysis was done.
During the study period, 83 measures were collected. Using the Bland and Altman method, SaO(2) estimates by the SET system were more accurate than those by the conventional system (bias+/-2 S.D. of 0.0%+/-3.1% vs 2.1%+/-11.0%, respectively), even when only valid values (values accompanied by a satisfactory quality index) were considered (0.0%+/-2.7% vs 1.2%+/-7.0%).

Masimo Corporation (Irvine, CA) has developed pulse oximetry with claims of resistance to sources of interference. To test this premise, we compared the performance of the Masimo SET pulse oximeter to a conventional device, Nellcor N-200, and then with three other new-generation pulse oximeters, Nellcor N-395, Novametrix MARS, and Philips Viridia 24C.
We studied 26 nonsedated NICU infants who were on supplemental oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation. ECG heart rate (HR) from a bedside monitor and SpO(2) and PR from the two pulse oximeters were captured by a PC for a total of 156 hours. The ECG HR and pulse oximeter spectral waveform were analyzed at alarms for hypoxemia (SpO(2)< or = 85%) and/or bradycardia (HR< or = 80 bpm). We then compared the performance of the Masimo SET to three other new-generation pulse oximeters, Agilent Viridia 24C, Nellcor N-395, and Novametrix MARS, in a similar population of seven infants for a total of 28 hours. We added to the test criteria the ability of the various pulse oximeters to track acute changes in HR.
Compared with Nellcor, Masimo SET had 86% fewer false alarms, which also were shorter in duration, resulting in 92% less total alarm time. Masimo SET also identified nearly all bradycardias versus 14% for the Nellcor. Compared with the new-generation pulse oximeters, false desaturations, data drop-outs, and false bradycardias were lowest for Masimo SET, as was the capture of true desaturations and bradycardias. Notably, the new-generation devices differed greatly in their ability to detect changes in HR (i.e., the frequency of frozen PR during times of ECG HR change was 0, 6, 11, and 46 for Masimo, Nellcor, Philips, and Novametrix, respectively).
Masimo SET pulse oximetry recorded markedly fewer false SpO(2) and PR alarms and identified more true hypoxic and bradycardic events than either conventional or other new-generation pulse oximeters. Masimo SET also most closely reflected the ECG rate irrespective of accelerations or decelerations in HR.
Routine use of Masimo SET pulse oximetry in the NICU could improve clinician confidence in the parameter leading to more judicious titration of oxygen with possible reductions in hypoxic (e.g., pulmonary hypertension) and hyperoxic (e.g., retinopathy of prematurity) pathology. Additionally, a more trustworthy technology should equate with fewer confirmatory arterial blood gas analyses (less blood loss), and faster weaning from the mechanical ventilation (less chronic lung disease).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12082469/
