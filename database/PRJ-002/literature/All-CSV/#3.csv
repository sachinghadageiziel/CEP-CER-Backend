34856563,Transient End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide Elevation During Pediatric Upper Endoscopy With Carbon Dioxide Insufflation: Is It True Hypercapnia?,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,2022,"Dike CR, Bishop WP, Titler SS, Rahhal R","Endoscopic insufflation, long performed using air, is being replaced by carbon dioxide (CO2) at many pediatric centers, despite limited published data on its use in children. We have previously demonstrated that CO2 use during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in non-intubated children is associated with transient elevations of end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2). This observation raised concerns about possible CO2 inhalation and systemic absorption. Here, we investigate this concern by concurrently measuring both EtCO2 and transcutaneous CO2 (tCO2) during upper endoscopic procedures in children.
To determine if elevations in EtCO2 levels seen in non-intubated children undergoing CO2 insufflation during EGD are associated with elevated systemic CO2 levels.
Double-blinded, prospective, randomized clinical trial. Children were randomized 1:1 to receive either CO2 or air for endoscopic insufflation. EtCO2 was sampled with a CO2-sampling nasal cannula and tCO2 was monitored using the Radiometer transcutaneous monitoring device.
Fifty nine patients were enrolled; 30 patients in the CO2 insufflation group and 29 in the air group. All patients underwent a procedure involving an EGD. Transient elevations in EtCO2 (defined as >60 mmHg) were observed only in the CO2 insufflation group. This contrasted with the similar elevations of tCO2 between the CO2 and air insufflation groups. None of these events were of clinically significant magnitude or duration.
This study demonstrates that the observed transient elevations in EtCO2 seen during EGD in non-intubated children receiving CO2 insufflation are most likely measurements of eructated CO2 without evidence of excessive systemic absorption of CO2.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856563/
24965523,Performance of capnometry in non-intubated infants in the pediatric intensive care unit.,BMC pediatrics,2014,"Coates BM, Chaize R, Goodman DM, Rozenfeld RA","Assessing the ventilatory status of non-intubated infants in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) is a constant challenge. Methods to evaluate ventilation include arterial blood gas analysis (ABG), which is invasive and intermittent, and transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring (PtcCO2), which, while non-invasive, is also intermittent. A method that is non-invasive and continuous would be of great benefit in this population. We hypothesized that non-invasive capnometry via sidestream monitoring of exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) would provide an acceptable measurement of ventilatory status when compared to ABG or PtcCO2.
Preliminary prospective study of infants less than one year of age admitted to the PICU in a large urban teaching hospital. Infants not intubated and not requiring non-invasive ventilation were eligible. A sidestream CO2 reading was obtained in a convenience sample of 39 patients. A simultaneous ABG was collected in those with an arterial catheter, and a PtcCO2 was obtained in those without.
Correlation of sidestream CO2 with ABG was excellent (r(2) = 0.907). Sidestream correlated less well with PtcCO2 (r(2) = 0.649). Results were not significantly altered when weight and respiratory rate were added as independent variables. Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias of -2.7 with a precision of ±6.5 when comparing sidestream CO2 to ABG, and a bias of -1.7 with a precision of ±9.9 when comparing sidestream CO2 to PtcCO2.
Performance of sidestream monitoring of exhaled CO2 is acceptable clinical trending to assess the effectiveness of ventilation in non-intubated infants in the PICU.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24965523/
21309934,A retrospective analysis of benzodiazepine sedation vs. propofol anaesthesia in 252 patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.,HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,2011,"Lordan JT, Woods J, Keeling P, Paterson IM","Historically, hepatopancreatobiliary surgeons and gastroenterologists have undertaken endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) using benzodiazepine sedation (BS). This is poorly tolerated by a substantial number of patients, which leads to its potential premature abandonment and subsequent additional investigations and therapeutics, and hence to the exposure of patients to avoidable risk and the health service to increased costs. Furthermore, concerns have been raised in the recent literature regarding safe sedation techniques.
The aim of this study was to compare the completion rates and safety profile of ERCP using BS vs. those of ERCP using light propofol anaesthesia (PA).
We carried out a retrospective, case-matched comparison analysis of consecutive patients who underwent ERCP with BS vs. PA, in the presence of an anaesthetist, over a 2-year period. Benzodiazepine sedation consisted of midazolam, fentanyl and buscopan. Propofol anaesthesia consisted of propofol, fentanyl and buscopan administered via a mouth guard in a non-intubated patient. Patient demographics, complications and completion rates were recorded. Procedural monitoring included pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiography and end-tidal CO(2) . Statistical analyses used t-tests to compare continuous variables and chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests to compare categorical variables. A P-value of <0.05 was considered significant.
Of 252 patients included in the study, 128 (50.8%) received BS and 124 (49.2%) received PA. Median ages in the BS and PA groups were 69 years (range: 20-99 years) and 65 years (range: 26-98 years), respectively (P= 0.07). Median hospital stays in the BS and PA groups were 1 day (range: day case to 61 days) and 1 day (range: day case to 38 days), respectively (P= 0.61). Incidences of mild anaesthesia-related complications in the BS and PA groups were 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively (P= 0.97). There were no severe anaesthesia-related complications. Incidences of mild procedural complications in the BS and PA groups were 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively (P= 0.68). One severe procedural complication occurred in the PA group. Incidences of incomplete ERCP procedures in the BS and PA groups were 10.9% (n= 14) and 4.0% (n= 5), respectively (odds ratio = 2.92, 95% confidence interval 1.02-8.38; chi-squared test, P= 0.04; Fisher's exact test, P= 0.03).
Propofol anaesthesia for ERCP carried out in the presence of an anaesthetist is safe and may improve procedural completion rates.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21309934/
19301133,Flow-through versus sidestream capnometry for detection of end tidal carbon dioxide in the sedated patient.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2009,"Sakata DJ, Matsubara I, Gopalakrishnan NA, Westenskow DR, White JL, Yamamori S, Egan TD, Pace NL","End tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)) in non-intubated patients can be monitored using either sidestream or flow-through capnometry [Yamamori et al., J Clin Monit Comput 22(3):209-220, 2008]. The hypothesis of this validation study is that, flow-through capnometry will yield a more accurate estimate of ETCO(2) than sidestream capnometry when evaluated in a bench study during low tidal volumes and high oxygen administration via nasal cannula. Secondarily, when ETCO(2) from each is compared to arterial CO(2) (PaCO(2)) during a study in which healthy, non-intubated volunteers are tested under normocapnic, hypocapnic and hypercapnic conditions, the flow-through capnometer will resemble PaCO(2) more closely than the sidestream capnometer. This will be especially true during periods of lower minute ventilation and high oxygen flow rates via mask in non-intubated, remifentanil sedated, healthy volunteers whose physiologic deadspace is small.
The performance of a flow-through (cap-ONE, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and a sidestream (Microcap Smart CapnoLine Plus, Oridion Inc., Needham, MA) capnometer were compared in a bench study and a volunteer trial. A bench study evaluated ETCO(2) accuracy using waveforms generated via mechanical lungs during low tidal volumes and high oxygen flow rates. A volunteer study compared the ETCO(2) for each capnometer against PaCO(2) during sedation in which 8 l O(2) was delivered via mask rather than the nasal cannula.
In the bench study, the flow-through capnometer gave slightly higher values of ETCO(2) during high-flow oxygen and no discernable differences during variable tidal volumes. Bland and Altman plots comparing ETCO(2) to PaCO(2) showed essentially equal performance between the two capnometers in the volunteers.
Within a wide limit of agreement between the volunteer and bench study, flow-through and sidestream capnometry performed equally well during bench testing and in non-intubated, sedated patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19301133/
