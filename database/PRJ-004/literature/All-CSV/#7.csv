38908938,Effect of Ciprofol on Left Ventricular Myocardial Strain and Myocardial Work in Children Undergoing Cardiac Surgery: A Single-center Double-blind Randomized Noninferiority Study.,Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,2024,"Qin X, Dan Y, Wang H, Sun L, Ji W, Bai J, Mamtili I, Zhang K, Zheng J","The current work was designed to compare the effects of ciprofol and propofol on left ventricular systolic function and myocardial work by noninvasive speckle-tracking echocardiography in children undergoing surgical repair of atrial septal or ventricular septal defects.
A single-center double-blind randomized noninferiority study was conducted.
The research occurred at a tertiary care center affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.
One hundred and twelve children aged 1 month to 16 years undergoing atrial septal or ventricular septal defect surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were included.
One hundred and twelve children were allocated randomly to receive ciprofol (n = 67) or propofol (n = 45) in a 1.5:1 ratio. Ciprofol or propofol were intravenously infused at loading doses of 0.4 mg/kg or 2.0 mg/kg, respectively, over 30 seconds, depending on the physical condition of each patient. When the bispectral index was maintained between 45 and 55 after induction, transthoracic echocardiography, including apical two-chamber, three-chamber, and four-chamber views, were collected bedside.
Of the 112 patients enrolled, 104 completed the study. Global longitudinal strain in the ciprofol and propofol groups after anesthesia was -17.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] -18.0% to -16.6%) and -17.8% (95% CI -18.7 to -17.0%) in the full analysis set and -17.5% (95% CI -18.2% to -16.9%) and -17.8% (95% CI -18.7% to -17.0%) in the per-protocol set, respectively. The noninferiority margin was set at 2% and confirmed with a lower limit of two-sided 95% CI for the intergroup difference of 1.58% in the full analysis set and 1.34% in the per-protocol set. There were no significant differences between the groups in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function and myocardial work indices. Postoperative vasoactive-inotropic score, NT-proBNP, duration of mechanical ventilation, and the length of stay in the cardiac intensive care unit and hospital were also comparable between the two groups (all p > 0.05).
Ciprofol did not show different effects on myocardial function and postoperative outcomes from propofol. Further, on the sensitive cardiac systole marker global longitudinal strain, ciprofol demonstrated noninferiority to propofol. Ciprofol might be an alternative solution for cardiac anesthesia in children with congestive heart disease with mild lesion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38908938/

While many studies have assessed the response of these markers to propofol sedation and anesthetic gases, few studies have compared these markers when using dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist. Fifty-one patients underwent drug induced sleep endoscopy with dexmedetomidine sedation. Continuous EEG was captured using SedLine (Masimo, Inc), and a playback system was used to extract the bispectral index (BIS) (Medtronic Inc), the patient state index (PSI) (Masimo, Inc), the state and response Entropy (GE Healthcare), and calculate the spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF95). Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores were assessed continually throughout the procedure and in recovery. We assessed the correlation between EEG markers and constructed ordinal logistic regression models to predict the RASS score and compare EEG markers. All three commercial EEG metrics were significantly associated with the RASS score (p < 0.001 for all metrics) whereas SEF95 alone was insufficient at characterizing dexmedetomidine sedation. PSI and Entropy achieved higher accuracy at predicing deeper levels of sedation as compared to BIS (PSI: 58.3%, Entropy: 58.3%, BIS: 44.4%). Lightening secondary to RASS score assessment is significantly captured by all three commercial EEG metrics (p < 0.001). Commercial EEG monitors can capture changes in the brain state associated with the RASS score during dexmedetomidine sedation. PSI and Entropy were highly correlated and may be better suited for assessing deeper levels of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36550344/

Measurable cardiovascular and neurophysiological signals, such as frontal EEG, frontal EMG, heart rate, and blood pressure, have potential in sedation and nociception monitoring. The hypothesis of this explorative study is that derived variables from the aforementioned signals predict the level of sedation, as described by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation score (RASS), and respond to painful stimuli during critical care.
Thirty adult postoperative ICU patients on mechanical ventilation and receiving intravenous sedation, excluding patients with primary neurological disorders, head injury, or need for continuous neuromuscular blockage. Bispectral Index (BIS), EMG power (EMG), EMG-derived Responsiveness Index (RI), and averaged blood pressure variability (ARV) were tested against RASS measurements. The aforementioned variables together with blood pressure and Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) were explored before and after painful stimuli (for example bronchoscopy, or pleural puncture) at varying RASS levels, to test variable responsiveness.
BIS, EMG, and RI predicted RASS levels with a prediction probability (P
Variables derived from EEG and EMG are associated with sedation levels, as described by the RASS score. Furthermore, these variables, along with ARV, react with consistency to painful stimuli during deep sedation (RASS -5 to -3), offering novel tools for nociception-sedation monitoring of mechanically ventilated ICU patients requiring deep sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36380289/

33640118,Offline comparison of processed electroencephalogram monitors for anaesthetic-induced electroencephalogram changes in older adults.,British journal of anaesthesia,2021,"Eagleman SL, Drover CM, Li X, MacIver MB, Drover DR","Several devices record and interpret patient brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) to aid physician assessment of anaesthetic effect. Few studies have compared EEG monitors on data from the same patient. Here, we describe a set-up to simultaneously compare the performance of three processed EEG monitors using pre-recorded EEG signals from older surgical patients.
A playback system was designed to replay EEG signals into three different commercially available EEG monitors. We could then simultaneously calculate indices from the SedLine® Root (Masimo Inc., Irvine, CA, USA; patient state index [PSI]), bilateral BIS VISTA™ (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA; bispectral index [BIS]), and Datex Ohmeda S/5 monitor with the Entropy™ Module (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA; E-entropy index [Entropy]). We tested the ability of each system to distinguish activity before anaesthesia administration (pre-med) and before/after loss of responsiveness (LOR), and to detect suppression incidences in EEG recorded from older surgical patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers. We show examples of processed EEG monitor output tested on 29 EEG recordings from older surgical patients.
All monitors showed significantly different indices and high effect sizes between comparisons pre-med to after LOR and before/after LOR. Both PSI and BIS showed the highest percentage of deeply anaesthetised indices during periods with suppression ratios (SRs) > 25%. We observed significant negative correlations between percentage of suppression and indices for all monitors (at SR >5%).
All monitors distinguished EEG changes occurring before anaesthesia administration and during LOR. The PSI and BIS best detected suppressed periods. Our results suggest that the PSI and BIS monitors might be preferable for older patients with risk factors for intraoperative awareness or increased sensitivity to anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33640118/
25598294,Navigator® and SmartPilot® View are helpful in guiding anesthesia and reducing anesthetic drug dosing.,Minerva anestesiologica,2015,"Cirillo V, Zito Marinosci G, De Robertis E, Iacono C, Romano GM, Desantis O, Piazza O, Servillo G, Tufano R","The recently introduced Navigator® (GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) and SmartPilot® View (Dräger Medical, Lübeck, Germany) show the concentrations and predicted effects of combined anesthetic drugs, and should facilitate more precisely their titration. Our aim was to evaluate if Navigator® or SmartPilot® View guided anesthesia was associated with a good quality of analgesia, depth of hypnosis and may reduce anesthetic requirements.
We performed a prospective non-randomized study. Sixty ASA I-II patients undergoing balanced general anesthesia for abdominal and plastic surgery were enrolled. Patients were divided in 4 groups. Group 1 (N. 15) and group 3 (N. 15) were cases in whom anesthesia was performed with standard monitoring plus the aid of Navigator® (Nav) or SmartPilot® View (SPV) display. Group 2 (N. 15) and group 4 (N. 15) were controls in whom anesthesia was performed with standard monitoring (heart rate, NIBP, SpO2, end-tidal CO2, end-expired sevoflurane concentration, train of four, Bispectral Index [Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA, USA] or Entropy [GE Healthcare]). Patients' vital parameters and end-expired sevoflurane concentration were recorded during anesthesia.
All patients recovered uneventfully and showed hemodynamic stability. End-tidal sevoflurane concentrations values [median (min-max)], during maintenance of anesthesia, were significantly (P<0.05) lower in SPV [1.1% (0.8-1.5)] and Nav [1%(0.8-1.8)] groups compared to SPV-control group [1.5%(1-2.5)] and Nav-control group [1.5%(0.8-2)]. BIS and entropy values were respectively higher in the SPV group [53 (46-57)] compared to the control group [43 (37-51)] (P<0.05) and Nav group [53 (43-60)] compared to the control group [41 (35-51)] (P<0.05). No significant differences in Remifentanil dosing were observed in the four groups.
Navigator® and SmartPilot® View may be of clinical use in monitoring adequacy of anesthesia. Both displays can optimize the administration and monitoring of anesthetic drugs during general anesthesia and may reduce the consumption of volatile anesthetic agents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25598294/
18043061,Quantification of epileptiform electroencephalographic activity during sevoflurane mask induction.,Anesthesiology,2007,"Särkelä MO, Ermes MJ, van Gils MJ, Yli-Hankala AM, Jäntti VH, Vakkuri AP","Sevoflurane may induce epileptiform electroencephalographic activity leading to unstable Bispectral Index numbers, underestimating the hypnotic depth of anesthesia. The authors developed a method for the quantification of epileptiform electroencephalographic activity during sevoflurane anesthesia.
Electroencephalographic data from 60 patients under sevoflurane mask induction were used in the analysis. Electroencephalographic data were visually classified. A novel electroencephalogram-derived quantity, wavelet subband entropy (WSE), was developed. WSE variables were calculated from different frequency bands. Performance of the WSE in detection and quantification of epileptiform electroencephalographic activity and the ability of the WSE to recognize misleading Bispectral Index readings caused by epileptiform activity were evaluated.
Two WSE variables were found to be sufficient for the quantification of epileptiform activity: WSE from the frequency bands 4-16 and 16-32 Hz. The lower frequency band was used for monophasic pattern monitoring, and the higher frequency band was used for spike activity monitoring. WSE values of the lower and higher bands followed the time evolution of epileptiform activity with prediction probabilities of 0.809 (SE, 0.007) and 0.804 (SE, 0.007), respectively. In deep anesthesia with epileptiform activity, WSE detected electroencephalographic patterns causing Bispectral Index readings greater than 60, with event sensitivity of 97.1%.
The developed method proved useful in detection and quantification of epileptiform electroencephalographic activity during sevoflurane anesthesia. In the future, it may improve the understanding of electroencephalogram-derived information by assisting in recognizing misleading readings of depth-of-anesthesia monitors. The method also may assist in minimizing the occurrence of epileptiform activity and seizures during sevoflurane anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18043061/
