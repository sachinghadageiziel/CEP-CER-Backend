However, the reliability and comparability of these optimal (Opt) parameters across different autoregulatory indices remain uncertain. This paper systematically reviews and synthesizes literature comparing CPPopt, MAPopt, and BISopt derived from invasive and noninvasive indices. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, studies directly comparing CPPopt, MAPopt, or BISopt from at least two indices were included. Ten studies compared CPPopt, mostly in traumatic brain injury, with mean values between 70 and 76 mmHg. Nine studies compared MAPopt, reporting strong correlations between transcranial doppler-, near-infrared spectroscopy-, and intracranial pressure-derived indices across populations, though limits of agreement were wide. One study compared BISopt across indices, showing internal consistency, while two cross-Opt studies found little correlation between BISopt and CPPopt or MAPopt. CPPopt and MAPopt appear physiologically robust across indices, supporting translational potential in both invasive and noninvasive settings. BISopt may represent a distinct optimization domain related to sedation rather than perfusion. Methodological heterogeneity and limited outcome validation remain barriers. Future work should emphasize standardization, multimodal integration, and outcome-driven trials.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41420383/

41054086,The effect of intravenous lignocaine infusion on intraoperative desflurane requirement: A randomised controlled trial.,Medicine,2025,"Sayed Masri SNN, Matthew Rona WA, Muhamad Suhaini NA, Mohamad Yusof A, Budiman M, Masdar A, Izaham A","Perioperative intravenous (IV) lignocaine infusion has a minimum alveolar concentration sparing effect, and this study was designed to investigate the impact of IV lignocaine infusion on the intraoperative end-tidal desflurane (Et-Des) concentration required to maintain the Bispectral Index Scale (BIS) values between 40 and 60.
Forty-eight patients were recruited for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendicectomy, or ovarian cystectomy. They were randomly assigned to Group A, who received a bolus of 1.5 mg kg⁻1 of 2% lignocaine hydrochloride over 3 minutes, followed by an IV infusion of 1 mg kg⁻1 h⁻1 until skin closure, and Group B, who received an equal volume of normal saline. Baseline BIS values, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure were recorded before induction of anesthesia and subsequently every 10 minutes until skin closure. Et-Des concentration, hemodynamic changes, BIS, minimum alveolar concentration, the dose of fentanyl administered, and the amount and cost of desflurane used between the 2 groups were analyzed.
Et-Des concentration in Group A (4.3% ± 0.45%) was significantly lower than in Group B (5.3% ± 0.56%, P < .001). The cost of desflurane was significantly reduced in Group A than in Group B (Ringgit Malaysia: 35.79 ± 7.43 vs Ringgit Malaysia: 46.37 ± 9.75, P < .001). Both groups' heart rate and mean arterial pressure showed no significant differences (P  = .484 and 0.619, respectively).
Intravenous lignocaine infusion reduces the Et-Des concentration, amount, and cost required to maintain the BIS value at 40 to 60 without significant hemodynamic changes or side effects in laparoscopic abdominal surgery. The usage of intravenous lignocaine infusion as adjunct to anesthesia is feasible to reduce anesthetic agent requirement.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41054086/
41034765,"Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of Dexmedetomidine two-phase flow atomization in healthy subjects: a randomized, parallel study.",BMC anesthesiology,2025,"Lian Y, Luo H, Yang Z, He J, Chen H, Sun Y","In this study, we aimed to compare the sedative effects, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and safety of dexmedetomidine (DEX) administered using a two-phase flow atomization device with those of conventional intranasal drop-based administration in healthy volunteers.
This prospective, parallel, double-blind study compared the PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of DEX administered via conventional intranasal drop (Group C) or two-phase flow atomization (Group E). Twenty-two healthy adult volunteers were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two groups using a computer-generated randomization sequence. Each participant received DEX at a dose of 2 µg/kg. Sedation was assessed using the Ramsay Sedation Scale and the bispectral index, and PK analysis was performed on blood samples collected at multiple time points.
The two-phase flow atomization group exhibited a significantly faster onset of sedation than the conventional intranasal drop-based administration group and a longer duration of sedation. Compared with Group C, Group E presented an increasing trend in the maximum plasma concentration and in the area under the concentration‒time curve from time zero to the last time point (AUC0t). We found no significant differences in other PK parameters between the two groups, with all P-values > 0.05. The plasma concentrations were slightly higher in the two-phase flow atomization group after 30 min. The changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate of both groups of volunteers were within 25% of the baseline values, with no adverse reactions such as hypotension or sinus bradycardia. CONCLUSIONS : The findings indicate that the two-phase flow atomization device offers faster onset and longer duration of sedation with DEX nasal administration, with a favorable safety profile in healthy volunteers (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Class 1) under specific conditions. Therefore, based on the sedation dynamics, we infer that this device may enhance drug deposition in the olfactory region of the nasal cavity, thereby enhancing the effects of the drug in the central nervous system through nose-to-brain delivery. This study provides new insights into the optimization of nasal drug delivery devices, particularly for pediatric patients and patients in clinical settings requiring rapid sedation.

In addition to patients with traumatic brain injuries, critically ill patients with sepsis, encephalopathy, and post-cardiopulmonary resuscitation are at risk of developing neurological complications. The situation can worsen when patients are sedated and intubated, which prevents the clinical manifestations to be presented. In this regard, non-convulsive seizures and status epilepticus, new onset strokes, and neuromuscular weakness syndromes could be missed which escalates the prognosis. The advancement of neuromonitoring technology enables real-time, multimodal assessments of brain functions, improving the ability of clinicians to detect and preemptively address potential neurological complications. In this study, we reviewed which certain neurological and medical conditions pose a high risk for developing secondary or new-onset neurological complications. Additionally, we reviewed various approaches that can assist in detecting these complications, including automated pupillometry, Bispectral Index monitoring, electroencephalogram, somatosensory evoked potentials monitoring, jugular venous oxygen saturation monitoring, PbO2 monitoring, near-infrared spectroscopy, transcranial Doppler sonography, thermal diffusion flowmetry, cerebral perfusion pressure monitoring, and biomarkers associated with neuronal damage.

We hypothesised that pre-operative dexmedetomidine nasal spray would reduce the incidence of emergence agitation in adult patients undergoing these procedures.
We conducted a randomised double-blind controlled trial in adults scheduled for ear, nose and throat surgery. Patients were allocated (1:1) to receive nasal spray with dexmedetomidine (75-100 μg based on age and weight) or 0.9% saline, 30 min before induction. Sevoflurane anaesthesia was titrated to bispectral index 40-60. The primary outcome was the incidence of emergence agitation (Riker sedation agitation scale score ≥ 5 from sevoflurane discontinuation to 5 min post-tracheal extubation).
We recruited 159 patients (median (IQR [range]) age 50 (36-60 [18-77]) y; 62% male). The incidence of emergence agitation in patients allocated to the dexmedetomidine group was 25% (20/80) compared with 47% (37/79) in those allocated to the 0.9% saline group (RR 0.53, 95%CI 0.34-0.82, p = 0.004), with a number needed to treat of 4.6. Secondary and exploratory outcomes showed that dexmedetomidine nasal spray was associated with: less venepuncture pain; reduced rate of sleep disturbance on the first night after surgery; and higher patient satisfaction, without increasing adverse events.
Pre-operative dexmedetomidine nasal spray reduced emergence agitation in adult patients undergoing ear, nose and throat surgery, and could enhance peri-operative care for these procedures.
People often feel confused, upset or restless when they wake up after ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery. This can be uncomfortable and cause problems. Doctors thought that give a drug through a nose spray (called dexmedetomidine) before surgery might help stop this from happening. Doctors did a study with adult patients having ENT surgery. Half of the patients got the nose spray with medicine (dexmedetomidine), and the other half got a spray with salty water (normal saline). No one knew who got which spray. The spray was given 30 minutes before the surgery started. All patients were put to sleep using the same type of gas (sevoflurane) and doctors carefully watched their brain activity to make sure they were asleep enough. The main thing doctors looked for was how many people became upset or restless right after waking up. The study included 159 patients. In the group that got the medicine spray, 25% became agitated after waking up. In the group that got the salty water, 47% became agitated. This means the medicine helped a lot: only about 1 in every 5 people needed the spray to see a benefit. The medicine also helped people feel less pain when getting a needle, sleep better the first night after surgery and feel happier overall. It did not cause extra problems or side effects. Giving dexmedetomidine nose spray before surgery helped adults wake up more calmly after ENT surgery. It could be a good way to make the whole surgery experience safer and more comfortable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40778580/

This retrospective cohort study analyzed clinical data from patients aged ≥60 years who underwent hip fracture surgery between January 2023 and December 2024 at our center. Patients were divided into two groups based on the anesthetic administered: group remimazolam tosilate (RT) (n = 105) and group propofol (P) (n = 115). Anesthetic efficacy outcomes included the time from the start of induction to achieving a bispectral index (BIS) ≤60 and a Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score ≤3, as well as the time from discontinuation of the anesthetic agent to extubation and discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Safety outcomes included assessments of hemodynamic stability and the incidence of adverse events.
Both groups achieved comparable sedation efficacy (BIS ≤60, MOAA/S ≤3). Group RT exhibited significantly shorter extubation times (7.04 ± 1.41 min
RT provides effective anesthesia with faster recovery and enhanced hemodynamic stability compared to propofol in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Additionally, its lower incidence of injection pain further supports its safety, suggesting that RT is a promising alternative for anesthesia in this patient population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40665940/

Prospective, single-center, open-label analytical study.
It was conducted in adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery.
The patients (n = 144) were segregated into three groups; Group 1 - Stenotic VHD (MS, AS), Group 2 - Regurgitant VHD (Mitral Regurgitation, Aortic Regurgitation), and Group 3 - Control (coronary artery disease).

To optimize intraoperative analgesic titration, several monitoring devices have been developed, each targeting specific physiologic variables. However, existing devices primarily focus on isolated components of the nociceptive response, such as autonomic or cortical activity, without integrating these perspectives comprehensively. Our aim was to compare the performance of different nociception monitors in response to standardized tetanic stimulation and to investigate the correlation between these monitors' responses and varying concentrations of remifentanil.
In this study, we evaluated and compared the responses of the Nociception Level index (NOL), Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI), Pupillary Reflex Dilation (PRD) and both raw and processed electroencephalogram (EEG) under varying concentrations of propofol and remifentanil. Standardized tetanic stimuli were administered to patients under general anesthesia with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. EEG, PRD, NOL, ANI, heart rate (HR), Bispectral index (BIS), and CONOX monitor indices (qCON and qNOX) were concomitantly recorded.
ANI, BIS, HR, NOL, PRD, and qNOX significantly changed after noxious stimulation. In our dataset, PRD had the strongest correlation with varying remifentanil concentrations, while ANI, NOL, and qNOX did not show significant correlations with remifentanil concentrations. Following a noxious stimulus, the raw EEG in patients with low PRD exhibited a significant increase in power in the high EEG frequencies around 25 Hz and decreased power in frequencies corresponding to the alpha range (8-12 Hz) in the power spectral density.
PRD, HR, and BIS correlated with varying levels of remifentanil, with PRD exhibiting the strongest correlation. When CE remifentanil are low, noxious stimuli are more likely to dilate the pupil and be detected in the EEG. Considering the complexity of the nociceptive response, integrating multimodal neurophysiologic monitoring with pharmacological data may improve the anesthesiologist's ability to assess on the nociception-antinociception balance. However, further studies are needed to validate these findings and address the study's limitations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40220354/

We randomized 112 patients undergoing ureteroscopic surgery into two groups: the Ciprofol group (Group C), with an induction dose of 0.4 mg/kg and a maintenance dose of 0.8-1.5 mg/(kg·h), and the Propofol group (Group P), with an induction dose of 2 mg/kg and a maintenance dose of 4-10 mg/(kg·h). Both groups received sevoflurane at a concentration of 1%. The Bispectral Index (BIS) was maintained between 40 and 60. The primary outcomes were the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) scores on postoperative day 1 (POD1). Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic parameters, vasopressor use, timing indicators, sedative consumption, BIS values, Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale (R-SAS) scores, urinary tract symptoms, patient satisfaction, and adverse events.
No significant differences were observed in QoR-15 scores between the two groups. Although Group C had higher pain (P = 0.004) and comfort (P = 0.002) scores on POD1, these differences were not clinically significant. The incidence of hypotension and vasopressor use was lower in Group C, which had more stable hemodynamics. Additionally, the time from induction to BIS ≤ 60 was shorter in Group P (P = 0.001), while Group C had lower BIS values from drug discontinuation to full recovery of consciousness (P = 0.001). The incidence of urinary tract symptoms on POD1 was lower in Group C (P = 0.043). There were no significant differences in time to spontaneous breathing recovery, extubation, recovery room stay, time to first ambulation, hospital stay, patient satisfaction, or other adverse events.
Ciprofol provides comparable early postoperative recovery to Propofol during ureteroscopy and may be a preferable alternative for urological procedures, especially in patients with blood pressure concerns.

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether use of a BIS monitor to guide sevoflurane administration might reduce the average end tidal sevoflurane concentration used in children 4-18 years of age.
Participants in three age groups (4-8, 9-12, and 13-18 years) were randomized to either the BIS guided group or the control group. Use of sevoflurane as the primary maintenance anesthetic was the only requirement in both arms. In the BIS guided group, sevoflurane was titrated to achieve a target BIS value of 45-60 during the maintenance period. In the control arm, clinicians were blinded to the BIS value. Primary outcome was mean end-tidal sevoflurane concentration during maintenance phase of anesthesia. Secondary assessments included time to discharge and the readiness and quality of recovery as assessed by the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale, the modified Aldrete Score, and the Wong-Baker FACES scale. An intention-to-treat analysis was used to analyze and compare groups.
A total of 180 participants were randomized. Following randomization, 10 participants did not undergo any study procedures, leaving 84 participants in the BIS guided group and 86 participants in the control group. Across all age groups, the average end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was less in the BIS guided group compared to control (4-8 years: 2.2% ± 0.3% vs. 2.4% ± 0.4%, -0.3% [-0.4%, -0.1%]; 9-12 years: 1.7% ± 0.5% vs. 2.1% ± 0.6%, -0.4% [-0.7%, -0.1%]; 13-18 years: 1.6% ± 0.4% vs. 1.9% ± 0.5%, -0.3% [-0.5%, -0.1%]). No differences in recovery outcomes between treatment groups were observed.
In pediatric participants, the BIS guided group reported a lower average end-tidal sevoflurane concentration compared to control, though no significant differences in recovery profile were noted.
The Bispectral Index (BIS) is a processed EEG tool that can be used to titrate general anesthesia to achieve desired anesthetic depth. Brain monitoring with BIS resulted in lower average end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations in children aged 4-18 years undergoing general anesthesia.

We examine the variability in bispectral index (BIS) scores associated with disconnected conscious and unconscious states as confirmed by a novel serial awakening paradigm.
Seventy adult participants, given propofol or dexmedetomidine, had a cumulative 1381 electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings across two centres. Participants were awakened periodically, and their recent conscious experience interrogated by structured questioning. BIS were reconstructed from EEG using openibis, and the distribution of BIS scores were compared using linear mixed effects modelling. The predictive capacity of BIS across states of consciousness was also examined.
Reconstructed BIS scores correlated significantly with blood concentrations of propofol and dexmedetomidine (all P<0.001). However, while the average BIS was different between baseline wakefulness (mean BIS=95.1 [standard deviation=3.5]); connected consciousness with drug present (84.0 [10.9]); disconnected consciousness (70.0 [16.9]); and unconsciousness (68.1 [16.1]), the interquartile range of these states (3.6, 15.1, 23.3 and 26.8, respectively) indicated high degrees of overlap and individual variability. Connected consciousness could be differentiated from either disconnected consciousness or unconsciousness with 86% accuracy (i.e. 14% error rate), and disconnected consciousness differentiated from unconsciousness with 74% accuracy.
These results agree with previous studies that BIS scores fail to reliably differentiate between states of consciousness, exacerbated by segregating connected, disconnected, and unconscious states. To develop a method that reliably identifies the conscious state of an individual (not an average), work is needed to establish the causal mechanisms of disconnection and unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39665912/

We analyzed an electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset for sevoflurane anesthesia using two wavelet transform-based mode decomposition methods, comprising the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and wavelet mode decomposition (WMD) methods, and compared the results with those from the previously reported variational mode decomposition (VMD) method.
To acquire the EEG data, we used the software application EEG Analyzer, which enabled the recording of raw EEG signals
When decomposed into six IMFs, the EWT enables narrow band separation of the low-frequency bands IMF-1 to IMF-3, in which all central frequencies are less than 10 Hz. However, in the upper IMF of the high-frequency band, which has a center frequency of ≥ 10 Hz, the dispersion within the frequency band covered was widespread among the individual patients. In WMD, a narrow band of clinical interest is specified using a bandpass filter in a Meyer wavelet filter bank within a specific mode-decomposition discipline.

However, most previous clinical experience with ciprofol was based on a robust population. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of ciprofol for anesthesia induction in female patients with frailty.
This prospective randomized controlled trial included patients with frailty undergoing elective general anesthesia for gynecological surgery. Frailty was assessed using the modified frailty index. The patients were randomly administered propofol (2 mg/kg) or ciprofol (0.5 mg/kg) during anesthesia induction. The depth of anaesthesia was continually monitored by the bispectral index. The primary outcome was the lowest systolic blood pressure (SBP) during anesthesia induction. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of general anesthesia induction failure and adverse events.
Among the 69 enrolled patients with frailty, 67 were included in the final analysis. The success rate of anesthesia induction was 100% in both groups. The lowest SBP was significantly higher in the ciprofol group than in the propofol group (103 [96-110] vs. 90 [85-98] mmHg, respectively; P < 0.001), suggesting that the former caused less inhibition of hemodynamics during anesthesia induction in patients with frailty. The incidence of injection pain was lower in the ciprofol group than in the propofol group (3 [8.8%] vs. 11 patients [33.3%], respectively; P = 0.014).

This study thus aimed to explore whether pre-anesthesia brain functional network metrics correlate with an individual's sensitivity to propofol.
A total of 54 subjects, including 30 patients and 24 healthy volunteers, were enrolled. Propofol was administered via a target-controlled infusion device, and anesthesia depth was monitored using a bispectral index monitor. Sensitivity to propofol was quantified using the induction time, measured from infusion onset to the bispectral index, which reached 60. Brain functional network metrics indicative of functional integration and segregation, centrality, and network resilience were computed from pre-anesthetic 60-channel EEG recordings. Linear regression analysis and machine learning predictive models were applied to evaluate the contribution of pre-anesthesia network metrics in predicting individual sensitivity to propofol.
Our analysis results revealed that subjects could be categorized into high- or low-sensitivity groups based on their induction time. Individuals with low sensitivity exhibited a greater network degree, clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and betweenness centrality, along with reduced modularity and assortativity coefficient in the alpha band. Furthermore, alpha band network metrics were significantly correlated with individual induction time. Leveraging these network metrics as features enabled the classification of individuals into high- or low-sensitivity groups with an accuracy of 94%.
Using a clinically relevant endpoint that signifies the level of anesthesia suitable for surgical procedures, this study underscored the robust correlation between pre-anesthesia alpha-band network metrics and individual sensitivity to propofol in a cohort that included both patients and healthy volunteers. Our findings offer preliminary insights into the potential utility of pre-anesthetic brain status assessment to predict propofol sensitivity on an individual basis, which may help to develop a more accurate personalized anesthesia plan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39366070/

Prior to incision, appropriate monitoring equipment, including an arterial line, Swan-Ganz catheter, brain saturation monitor and bispectral index monitor, is placed for proper management of haemodynamics. Sternotomy was performed, and the ascending aorta was cannulated, followed by bicaval cannulation for venous drainage. The patient was cooled to deep hypothermia. Once target temperature was achieved, circulatory arrest commenced. The left pulmonary artery was opened and the subacute component was removed without disrupting the plane of the chronic thromboembolic disease. An endarterectomy plane was then created proximally and dissected into the distal segmental/subsegmental branches. Once the endarterectomy was completed, the left pulmonary artery was closed. Circulation was resumed for end-organ perfusion. Once the right pulmonary artery was ready for dissection, circulatory arrest was restarted. Similarly to the left side, the subacute component was removed without disrupting the plane of the chronic thromboembolic disease. An endarterectomy plane was then created proximally and dissected into the distal segmental/subsegmental branches. Circulation was then resumed.

39302400,Effect of patient position on the EEG bispectral index and entropy index under general anaesthesia.,Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine,2025,"Chen W, Wang J, Wang L, Hu W, Chen X, Jin L","Perioperative depth monitoring techniques, such as electroencephalography bispectral index (BIS), entropy index, and auditory evoked potential, are commonly used to assess anesthesia depth. However, the influence of patient positioning changes, particularly in gynecological surgeries where a head-down position is often required, on the accuracy of these monitoring indices remains unexplored.
The aim of the our study was to observe the impact of patient position changes on the monitoring value of entropy and BIS to identify a more sensitive method of anaesthesia depth monitoring for gynaecological surgery patients.
We conducted a study involving 40 women undergoing general anesthesia, during which routine monitoring of vital signs, including electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR), noninvasive arterial blood pressure (NIBP), oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), and end-expiratory carbon dioxide (PetCO2), was initiated. Entropy and BIS devices were affixed to the patients' foreheads after alcohol sterilization to record brain activity. Tracheal intubation was performed following anesthesia induction. Throughout anesthesia maintenance, the value of BIS and response entropy (RE) were monitored and maintained between 40 and 50 by adjusting the infusion rate of propofol and remifentanil with Target Controlled Infusion (TCI, Mintopharmacokinetics model). Dosing for infusion control utilized corrected weight (height-105). Data were recorded before and after position changes, including tilting the operating table to head-down positions of 15 and 25 degrees, returning to a supine position, and elevating the head to 15 and 25-degree angles. BIS and entropy values at different time points were compared between the groups.
Both BIS and entropy values increased from supine to head-down position and decreased from supine to head-up position, with entropy changes preceding those of BIS. Heart rate increased after head-up and decreased after head-down, while mean blood pressure (MBP) exhibited the opposite effect on heart rate. Significant correlations were found between heart rate and BIS (correlation coefficient: -0.43) and RE (correlation coefficient: -0.416), as well as between MBP and BIS (correlation coefficient: 0.346) and RE (correlation coefficient: 0.384).
Changes in patient position can significantly affect the value of RE and BIS, as changes in entropy occur earlier than changes in the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39302400/

Furthermore, in asleep DBS anesthesia can impair the ability to record single-cell electric activity.The purpose of this study was to describe our surgical and anesthesiologic protocol for MER assessment during asleep subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS and to put our findings in the context of a systematic review of the literature. Sixty-three STN electrodes were implanted in 32 patients under general anesthesia. A frameless technique using O-Arm scanning was adopted in all cases. Total intravenous anesthesia, monitored with bispectral index, was administered using a target controlled infusion of both propofol and remifentanil. A systematic review of the literature with metanalysis on MER in asleep vs awake STN DBS for Parkinson Disease was performed. In our series, MER could be reliably recorded in all cases, impacting profoundly on electrode positioning: the final position was located within 2 mm from the planned target only in 42.9% cases. Depth modification > 2 mm was necessary in 21 cases (33.3%), while in 15 cases (23.8%) a different track was used. At 1-year follow-up we observed a significant reduction in LEDD, UPDRS Part III score off-medications, and UPDRS Part III score on medications, as compared to baseline. The systematic review of the literature yielded 23 papers; adding the cases here reported, overall 1258 asleep DBS cases using MER are described. This technique was safe and effective: metanalysis showed similar, if not better, outcome of asleep vs awake patients operated using MER. MER are a useful and reliable tool during asleep STN DBS, leading to a fine tuning of electrode position in the majority of cases. Collaboration between neurosurgeon, neurophysiologist and neuroanesthesiologist is crucial, since slight modifications of sedation level can impact profoundly on MER reliability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39031226/

We compared the recovery and hemodynamic parameters between the remimazolam-flumazenil and propofol groups during RFCA. Patients were randomized into the remimazolam-flumazenil and propofol groups. The primary outcome measure was the time to eye opening following the discontinuation of anesthetic agents. Secondary outcomes included time to extubation, time to discharge from the operating room, intraprocedural hemodynamic variables and postoperative quality outcomes. Fifty-three patients were included in the final analysis (n = 26 in the remimazolam-flumazenil and n = 27 in the propofol group).

From January 2022 to June 2023, a total of 30 patients with PSH secondary to moderate to severe craniocerebral injury in the NICU were monitored for BIS. The patients' paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity-assessment measure (PSH-AM) scores were recorded. PSH patients generally appear in 3 states: calm state, seizure state, and postmedication state. Thirty PSH patients' BIS values were recorded during the calm period, during the seizure state, and postmedication state, and these 3 different stages' BIS values were divided into groups A, B, and C, using the Kruskal-Wallis H test to compare groups.
The Kruskal-Wallis H test yielded a value of H=22.599, P <0.001. H0 was rejected against the test standard of α=0.05, and the BIS values of groups A, B, and C differed. The BIS values of group A and group B differed after a pairwise comparison, and the difference was statistically significant (adjusted P =0.001). Group B and group C had different BIS values, and the difference was statistically significant (adjusted P =0.001); group A and Group C had no difference in BIS values, and the difference was not statistically significant (adjusted P =1.00).

It is assessed using the pressure reactivity index (the correlation coefficient between mean arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure). The objective of this scoping review is to describe the existing evidence concerning the association of EEG and cerebrovascular autoregulation in order to identify key concepts and detect gaps in the current knowledge.
Embase, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science were searched considering articles between their inception up to September 2023. Inclusion criteria were human (paediatric and adult) and animal studies describing correlations between continuous EEG and cerebrovascular autoregulation assessments.
Ten studies describing 481 human subjects (67% adult, 59% critically ill) were identified. Seven studies assessed qualitative (e.g. seizures, epileptiform potentials) and five evaluated quantitative (e.g. bispectral index, alpha-delta ratio) EEG metrics. Cerebrovascular autoregulation was evaluated based on intracranial pressure, transcranial Doppler, or near infrared spectroscopy. Specific combinations of cerebrovascular autoregulation and EEG metrics were evaluated by a maximum of two studies. Seizures, highly malignant patterns or burst suppression, alpha peak frequency, and bispectral index were associated with cerebrovascular autoregulation. The other metrics showed either no or inconsistent associations.
There is a paucity of studies evaluating the link between EEG and cerebrovascular autoregulation.

The precise control over the temporary loss of consciousness is vital to ensure safe, pain-free procedures. Traditional methods of depth of anaesthesia (DoA) assessment, reliant on physical characteristics, have proven inconsistent due to individual variations. In response, electroencephalography (EEG) techniques have emerged, with indices such as the Bispectral Index offering quantifiable assessments. This literature review explores the current scope and frontier of DoA research, emphasising methods utilising EEG signals for effective clinical monitoring. This review offers a critical synthesis of recent advances, specifically focusing on electroencephalography (EEG) techniques and their role in enhancing clinical monitoring. By examining 117 high-impact papers, the review delves into the nuances of feature extraction, model building, and algorithm design in EEG-based DoA analysis. Comparative assessments of these studies highlight their methodological approaches and performance, including clinical correlations with established indices like the Bispectral Index. The review identifies knowledge gaps, particularly the need for improved collaboration for data access, which is essential for developing superior machine learning models and real-time predictive algorithms for patient management. It also calls for refined model evaluation processes to ensure robustness across diverse patient demographics and anaesthetic agents. The review underscores the potential of technological advancements to enhance precision, safety, and patient outcomes in anaesthesia, paving the way for a new standard in anaesthetic care.

38424486,Application of remimazolam-0.6% sevoflurane anesthesia for flash visual evoked potential monitoring during pituitary adenoma resection: a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial.,BMC anesthesiology,2024,"Shi F, Tang R, Du X, Li X, Wu G","Flash visual evoked potential (FVEP) is a critical method for monitoring intraoperative visual function during neurosurgery. A new benzodiazepine drug called remimazolam has recently been used for general anesthesia. However, the impact of remimazolam on FVEP remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate how remimazolam, in comparison to propofol, when combined with 0.6% sevoflurane anesthesia, affects the FVEP waveform during pituitary adenoma resection.
Overall, 36 patients undergoing pituitary adenoma resection under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to either the remimazolam group (Group R) or the propofol group (Group P) in a prospective, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial. For anesthesia induction, a bolus of 0.2 mg/kg remimazolam or 2 mg/kg propofol was intravenously infused for approximately one minute. The anesthesia was maintained by continuous infusion of either remimazolam (0.7-1.0 mg/kg/h) or propofol (4-6 mg/kg/h), in combination with 0.6% sevoflurane, aimed at sustaining the bispectral index (BIS) within the range of 40-60. The primary outcome was the N75-P100 amplitude of FVEP recorded at approximately 20 min after intubation (T0). 10% of the amplitude at T0 in group P was defined as the non-inferiority margin (δ). Confidence interval testing was used to evaluate the non-inferiority hypothesis. The secondary outcomes covered the P100 latency of FVEP, electroretinogram (ERG) b wave amplitude, demographic characteristics, hemodynamics, and occurrence of adverse events.
The BIS index during anesthesia was comparable between the groups at the same measured time points (P > 0.05). The N75-P100 amplitude at T0 in group R was 7.64 ± 1.36 µV, while it was 6.96 ± 0.95 µV in group P (P = 0.09), with a mean difference of 0.68 µV (95% CI, -0.11 µV to 1.48 µV). The δ was set at 0.7 and the lower limit of the 95% CI exceeded the -δ. Both remimazolam and propofol had little effect on ERG b-wave amplitudes. At the designated time points, FVEP amplitude and P100 latency displayed no appreciable variation between the two groups (P > 0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events related to anesthesia, needle electrodes, or surgery between the two groups (P > 0.05).
Our findings suggest that remimazolam-0.6% sevoflurane is non-inferior to propofol-0.6% sevoflurane for general anesthesia, based on the FVEP N75-P100 amplitude. The electrophysiological data obtained in both groups indicate that reproducible and stable FVEP and ERG waveforms can be acquired at set time points. Therefore, for reliable FVEP monitoring, remimazolam-0.6% sevoflurane appears to be a safe and effective protocol in general anesthesia.

The research on monitoring the depth of anesthesia mainly focuses on propofol, and bispectral index (BIS) is a sensitive and accurate objective index to evaluate the state of consciousness at home and abroad. This study mainly analyzed the effect of IoC on monitoring the depth of sevoflurane anesthesia and the consistency and accuracy with BIS when monitoring sevoflurane maintenance anesthesia.
To investigate the monitoring value of the Index of Consciousness (IoC) for the depth of sevoflurane anesthesia in laparoscopic surgery.
The study population consisted of 108 patients who experienced elective whole-body anesthesia procedures within the timeframe of April 2020 to June 2023 at our hospital. Throughout the anesthesia process, which encompassed induction and maintenance using inhaled sevoflurane, all patients were diligently monitored for both the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the Index of Consciousness (IoC). We conducted an analysis to assess the correlation between IoC and BIS throughout the anesthesia induction process and from the maintenance phase to the regaining of consciousness. To evaluate the predictive accuracy of IoC and BIS for the onset of unconsciousness during induction and the return of consciousness during emergence, we employed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
The mean difference between BIS and IoC, spanning from the pre-anesthesia induction phase to the completion of propofol induction, was 1.3 (95% Limits of Agreement [-53.4 to 56.0]). Similarly, during the interval from the initiation of sevoflurane inhalation to the point of consciousness restoration, the average difference between BIS and IoC was 0.3 (95% LOA [-10.8 to 11.4]). No statistically significant disparities were observed in the data acquired from the two measurement methodologies during both the anesthesia induction process and the journey from maintenance to the regaining of consciousness (

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,2023,"Zhao Y, Boley M, Pelentritou A, Woods W, Liley D, Kuhlmann L","This study characterizes the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying electromagnetic imaging signals using stability analysis. Researchers have proposed that transitions between conscious awake and anaesthetised states, and other brain states more generally, may result from system stability changes. The concept of stability in dynamical systems theory provides a mathematical framework to describe this possibility. In particular, the degree to which a system's trajectory in phase space is affected by small perturbations determines the stability. Previous studies using linear or oscillator-based whole-brain models cannot represent complex cerebrocortical dynamics, or model parameters were pre-assumed or inferred from data but did not change over time. This study proposes a nonlinear neurophysiologically plausible whole-cortex modeling framework to analyze the stability of brain dynamics for the emergence and disappearance of consciousness using time-varying parameters estimated from the data.Clinical relevance- Depth of anaesthesia is typically measured through changes in EEG statistics like the bispectral index and spectral entropy. However, these monitors have been found to fail in preventing awareness during surgery and postoperative recall. Our whole-cortex stability analysis may be useful in measuring anaesthesia levels in clinical settings, as it changes with the level of consciousness and is independent of individual differences and anaesthetic agents. The proposed method can also be used to, for example, identify critical brain regions for consciousness, locate the epileptogenic zone and investigate the dominance of extrinsic or intrinsic factors in brain functions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38082665/

We investigated the correlation of the electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters with the effect-site remimazolam concentration and the depth of sedation in patients receiving a target-controlled infusion of remimazolam.
This prospective observational study enrolled 35 patients (32 analyzed) who underwent lower extremity varicose vein surgery or lower extremity orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia. We administered remimazolam by target-controlled infusion using the pharmacokinetic model introduced by Schüttler et al. The EEG data were continuously recorded, including the bispectral index (BIS), patient state index (PSI), spectral edge frequency (SEF), and raw EEG signals. The relative beta ratio (RBR), defined as log (spectral power [30-47 Hz]/spectral power [11-20 Hz]), was obtained by analyzing raw EEG. The level of sedation corresponding to each effect-site remimazolam concentration was assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S). The prediction probability (Pk) and Spearman's correlation coefficients (R) were calculated between effect-site remimazolam concentration, MOAA/S, and EEG parameters.
BIS and PSI showed significantly higher Pk for effect-site remimazolam concentration (Pk = 0.76 [0.72-0.79], P < .001 for BIS; Pk = 0.76 [0.73-0.79], P < .001 for PSI) compared to RBR (Pk = 0.71 [0.68-0.74], P < .001) and SEF (Pk = 0.58 [0.53-0.63], P = .002). BIS, PSI, and RBR showed significantly higher correlation coefficients for effect-site remimazolam concentration (R = -0.70 [-0.78 to -0.63], P < .001 for BIS; R = -0.72 [-0.79 to -0.66], P < .001 for PSI; R = -0.61 [-0.69 to -0.54], P < .001 for RBR) compared to SEF (R = -0.22 [-0.36 to -0.08], P = .002). BIS and PSI also had significantly higher Pk and correlation coefficients for MOAA/S (Pk = 0.81 [0.79-0.83], P < .001; R = 0.84 [0.81-0.88], P < .001 for BIS) (Pk = 0.80 [0.78-0.83], P < .001; R = 0.82 [0.78-0.87], P < .001 for PSI) compared to RBR (Pk = 0.74 [0.72-0.77], P < .001; R = 0.72 [0.65-0.78], P < .001) and SEF (Pk = 0.55 [0.50-0.59], P = .041; R = 0.13 [-0.01 to 0.27], P = .067).
BIS, PSI, and RBR showed an acceptable correlation with the effect-site remimazolam concentration and depth of sedation in this study, suggesting that these EEG-derived parameters are potentially reliable hypnotic indicators during remimazolam sedation. BIS and PSI showed superior performance as hypnotic indicators to RBR and SEF in patients receiving target-controlled infusion of remimazolam.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38051672/

It is frequently used in the context of neuromuscular block. We have shown that a similar device, the Bispectral Index monitor (BIS), does not generate correct values in awake volunteers when neuromuscular blocking drugs are administered.
We replayed the EEGs recorded during awake paralysis from the original study to an Entropy monitor via a calibrated electronic playback system. Each EEG was replayed 30 times to evaluate the consistency of the Entropy output.
Both State Entropy and Response Entropy decreased during periods of neuromuscular block to values consistent with anaesthesia, despite there being no change in conscious state (State Entropy <60 in eight of nine rocuronium trials and nine of 10 suxamethonium trials). Entropy values did not return to pre-test levels until after the return of movement. Entropy did not generate exactly the same results when the same EEG was replayed multiple times, which is primarily because of a cyclical state within the Entropy system itself.
The GE Entropy™ monitor requires muscle activity to generate correct values in an awake subject. It could therefore be unreliable at detecting awareness in patients who have been given neuromuscular blocking drugs.

Currently, it is primarily used for gastroenteroscopy sedation.
The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of Remimazolam as an alternative intravenous anesthetic agent in surgical patients, in order to expand clinical options beyond Propofol.
Eighty patients aged 20-69 and classified as an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II were randomly assigned to either the Remimazolam group (RM group) or the Propofol group (PR group) for anesthesia induction and maintenance. Hemodynamics and Bispectral Index (BIS) were recorded before and after anesthesia, along with other relevant indices such as the time, to loss of consciousness (LoC), operation time, anesthesia time, awakening time, the number of cases of injection site pain. Additionally, the Ramsay sedation score, intraoperative awareness, dreaming, and postoperative adverse events were also assessed.
After anesthesia, both groups experienced a significant decrease in blood pressure compared to baseline values, however, the reduction in blood pressure was less significant in the RM group than in the PR group (P<0.05). The heart rate of patients in the RM group remained relatively stable at all time points. There were significantly more cases of injection site pain and use of pressor or atropine during operation observed in the PR group compared to the RM group (P<0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of time to loss of consciousness, anesthesia time, operation time, awakening time, and intraoperative awareness (P>0.05). However, at 5 and 30 minutes after awakening, the Ramsay sedation score was significantly better in the RM group compared to the PR group (P<0.05).
When remimazolam is used for intravenous anesthesia induction and maintenance, it can achieve a favorable anesthetic effect while maintaining a relatively stable blood pressure and heart rate.

The influence of depth of sedation indices such as the bispectral index (BIS) generated by the processed electroencephalogram (pEEG) machine to guide the management of anesthetic depth of sedation on postoperative outcome remains controversial. This research was designed to decide whether an anesthetic agent exposure determined by raw electroencephalogram (rEEG) can influence anesthetic management and cause different EEG patterns and affect various patient outcomes.
A total of 141 participants aged ≥ 60 years undergoing abdominal major surgery were randomized to rEEG-guided anesthesia or routine care group. The rEEG-guided anesthesia group had propofol titrated to keep the rEEG waveform at the C-D sedation depth during surgery, while in the routine care group the anesthetist was masked to the patient's rEEG waveform and guided the anesthetic management only through clinical experience. The primary outcome was the presence of postoperative complications, the secondary outcomes included intraoperative anesthetic management and different EEG patterns.
There were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of postoperative respiratory, circulatory, neurological and gastrointestinal complications. Further EEG analysis revealed that lower frontal alpha power was significantly associated with a higher incidence of POD, and that rEEG-guidance not only reduced the duration of deeper anesthesia in patients with lower frontal alpha power, but also allowed patients with higher frontal alpha power to receive deeper and more appropriate depths of anesthesia than in the routine care group.
In elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, rEEG-guided anesthesia did not reduce the incidence of postoperative respiratory, circulatory, neurological and gastrointestinal complications. rEEG-guided anesthesia management reduced the duration of intraoperative BS in patients and the duration of over-deep sedation in patients with lower frontal alpha waves under anesthesia, and there was a strong association between lower frontal alpha power under anesthesia and the development of POD. rEEG-guided anesthesia may improve the prognosis of patients with vulnerable brains by improving the early identification of frail elderly patients and providing them with a more effective individualized anesthetic managements.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37803259/

Hypoxia is a particular risk during rebreather diving. Given its subtle symptom profile and its catastrophic consequences there is a need for reliable hypoxia monitoring. Electroencephalography (EEG) is being investigated as a real time monitor for multiple diving problems related to inspired gas, including hypoxia.
A systematic literature search identified articles investigating the relationship between EEG changes and acute cerebral hypoxia in healthy adults. Quality of clinical evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
Eighty-one studies were included for analysis. Only one study investigated divers. Twelve studies described quantitative EEG spectral power differences. Moderate hypoxia tended to result in increased alpha activity. With severe hypoxia, alpha activity decreased whilst delta and theta activities increased. However, since studies that utilised cognitive testing during the hypoxic exposure more frequently reported opposite results it appears cognitive processing might mask hypoxic EEG changes. Other analysis techniques (evoked potentials and electrical equivalents of dipole signals), demonstrated sustained regulation of autonomic responses despite worsening hypoxia. Other studies utilised quantitative EEG analysis techniques, (Bispectral index [BISTM], approximate entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity). No change was reported in BISTM value, whilst an increase in approximate entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity occurred with worsening hypoxia.
Electroencephalographic frequency patterns change in response to acute cerebral hypoxia. There is paucity of literature on the relationship between quantitative EEG analysis techniques and cerebral hypoxia. Because of the conflicting results in EEG power frequency analysis, future research needs to quantitatively define a hypoxia-EEG response curve, and how it is altered by concurrent cognitive task loading.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37718302/

By comparison, the electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrogram enables the visualization of the brain response during anesthesia and may prevent unnecessary anesthetic consumption.
This retrospective study included 140 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy who received total intravenous anesthesia using a combination of propofol and dexmedetomidine infusions. Patients were equally matched to the spectrogram group (maintaining the robust EEG alpha power during surgery) or the index group (maintaining the BIS score between 40 and 60 during surgery) based on the propensity score of age and surgical type. The primary outcome was the propofol dose. Secondary outcome was the postoperative neurological profile.
Patients in the spectrogram group received significantly less propofol (1585 ± 581 vs. 2314 ± 810 mg, P < 0.001). Fewer patients in the spectrogram group exhibited delayed emergence (1.4% vs. 11.4%, P = 0.033). The postoperative delirium profile was similar between the groups (profile P = 0.227).

The development of electroencephalography analysis could provide indicators for early detection, intervention, and evaluation. If there are pathophysiological changes in the brain, the BIS value will also change accordingly. In this study, we investigated the predictive value of the preoperative bispectral (BIS) index in POD for patients aged over 75 years.
In this prospective study, patients (≥ 75 years) undergoing elective non-neurosurgery and non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia were included (n = 308). Informed consent was obtained from all involved patients. Before the operation and during the first 5 postoperative days, delirium was assessed with the confusion assessment method by trained researchers twice every day. Thereafter, the preoperative bedside BIS of each patient was dynamically acquired by the BIS VISTA monitoring system and the BIS monitoring of electrodes. A series of evaluation scales were assessed before and after surgery. A preoperative predictive score was generated according to the results of multivariable logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn and the area under the curves was estimated to evaluate the perioperative diagnostic values of BIS and preoperative predictive score for POD. The specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive (NPV) value were calculated.
Delirium occurred in 50 of 308 (16.2%) patients. The median BIS of delirious patients was 86.7 (interquartile range [IQR] 80.0-94.0), lower than that of the non-delirious 91.9 (IQR 89.7-95.4, P < 0.001). According to the ROC curve of the BIS index, the optimal cut-off value was 84, with a sensitivity of 48%, specificity of 87%, PPV 43%, NPV 89% for forecasting POD and the area under curves was 0.67. While integrating BIS, mini-mental state examination, anemia, activities of daily living, and blood urea nitrogen, the model had a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 74%, PPV of 0.37%, and NPV of 95% for forecasting POD, and the area under curves was 0.83.
Preoperative bedside BIS in delirium patients was lower than that in non-delirium patients when undergoing non-neurosurgery and non-cardiac surgery in patients aged over 75.

36616891,Improved Individualized Patient-Oriented Depth-of-Hypnosis Measurement Based on Bispectral Index.,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,"Karer G, Škrjanc I","Total intravenous anesthesia is an anesthesiologic technique where all substances are injected intravenously. The main task of the anesthesiologist is to assess the depth of anesthesia, or, more specifically, the depth of hypnosis (DoH), and accordingly adjust the dose of intravenous anesthetic agents. However, it is not possible to directly measure the anesthetic agent concentrations or the DoH, so the anesthesiologist must rely on various vital signs and EEG-based measurements, such as the bispectral (BIS) index. The ability to better measure DoH is directly applicable in clinical practice-it improves the anesthesiologist's assessment of the patient state regarding anesthetic agent concentrations and, consequently, the effects, as well as provides the basis for closed-loop control algorithms. This article introduces a novel structure for modeling DoH, which employs a residual dynamic model. The improved model can take into account the patient's individual sensitivity to the anesthetic agent, which is not the case when using the available population-data-based models. The improved model was tested using real clinical data. The results show that the predictions of the BIS-index trajectory were improved considerably. The proposed model thus seems to provide a good basis for a more patient-oriented individualized assessment of DoH, which should lead to better administration methods that will relieve the anesthesiologist's workload and will benefit the patient by providing improved safety, individualized treatment, and, thus, alleviation of possible adverse effects during and after surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36616891/

While many studies have assessed the response of these markers to propofol sedation and anesthetic gases, few studies have compared these markers when using dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist. Fifty-one patients underwent drug induced sleep endoscopy with dexmedetomidine sedation. Continuous EEG was captured using SedLine (Masimo, Inc), and a playback system was used to extract the bispectral index (BIS) (Medtronic Inc), the patient state index (PSI) (Masimo, Inc), the state and response Entropy (GE Healthcare), and calculate the spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF95). Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores were assessed continually throughout the procedure and in recovery. We assessed the correlation between EEG markers and constructed ordinal logistic regression models to predict the RASS score and compare EEG markers. All three commercial EEG metrics were significantly associated with the RASS score (p < 0.001 for all metrics) whereas SEF95 alone was insufficient at characterizing dexmedetomidine sedation. PSI and Entropy achieved higher accuracy at predicing deeper levels of sedation as compared to BIS (PSI: 58.3%, Entropy: 58.3%, BIS: 44.4%).

However, few studies have compared the PLE and bispectral index (BIS) methods for monitoring consciousness during clinical anesthesia, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) or anesthesia via inhalation. Therefore, we evaluated differences between the PLE and BIS methods in clinical anesthesia, including TIVA using propofol and anesthesia with sevoflurane.
The observational trial included 60 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. The BIS and PLE electrodes were placed together on the left temporal-frontal area of all patients. During anesthesia, anesthetic levels were adjusted using the BIS values, which are generally used to monitor the DoA; the level of anesthesia was maintained at between 40 and 60. BIS- and PLE-derived values were recorded continuously. Anesthetic events, the concentration of each anesthetic, and standard monitoring values were recorded. The patients included were divided into 2 groups, the TIVA and sevoflurane groups, with 30 patients in each. For the TIVA group, anesthesia was induced and maintained using propofol and remifentanil target-controlled infusion. For the sevoflurane group, anesthesia was induced using propofol and maintained using sevoflurane and remifentanil.
From loss of consciousness until the anesthetic maintenance period, PLE values were higher than BIS values at several time points. During the recovery period, BIS values were higher than PLE values (all P < .001). Spaghetti plots showed that there was more variation among the BIS values than among the PLE values.

Forty patients who underwent intracranial tumor resection and required MEP monitoring were selected. They were randomly divided into the lidocaine group (group L, n = 20) and the control group (group C, n = 20) by computer-generated randomization. All patients were given propofol anesthesia under the guidance of the bispectral index. In group L, 1 mg/kg of lidocaine was injected intravenously during anesthesia induction. Then, lidocaine was continuously pumped at a speed of 1 mg/kg/h until the operation started. Group C was given an equal volume of normal saline. Heart rate (HR), mean artery pressure (MAP), and bispectral index were recorded before anesthesia induction (T0), 2 minutes after tracheal intubation (T1), and 35 minutes (T2), and 50 minutes (T3) after anesthesia induction. The amplitude and latency of MEP at T2 and T3, the total dosage of propofol after anesthesia induction, and adverse events before T3 were recorded.
Compared with those in group C, HR and MAP were significantly decreased at T1 in group L. No significant differences were observed in HR and MAP at T0, T2, and T3 between group L and group C. The total dosage of propofol and the incidence of adverse events were significantly lower in group L than in group C before T3. There were no significant differences in the amplitude and latency of MEP between the 2 groups at each time point.
Low-dose lidocaine has no obvious effect on MEP in patients undergoing intracranial tumor resection. However, it increased hemodynamic stability, reduced propofol use, and decreased the incidence of adverse events.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35960044/

Hence, we investigated the feasibility and safety of remimazolam during the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia without using a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) in patients undergoing hysteroscopic surgery.
This prospective observational study included 38 patients undergoing hysteroscopic surgery. Remimazolam and remifentanil were the main anesthetic agents without an NMBA, and a supraglottic airway was inserted to protect the airway. The induction time, amount of each anesthetic agent used during anesthesia, intraoperative bispectral index (BIS) hemodynamic parameters, and recovery profiles were measured.
General anesthesia was successfully administered to 37 patients using remimazolam and remifentanil without NMBA. The induction doses of remimazolam and remifentanil were 0.4 mg/kg (interquartile range [IQR] 0.34-0.47 mg/kg) and 1.07 μg/kg (IQR, 0.90-1.29 μg/kg), respectively. Additionally, the maintenance doses of remimazolam and remifentanil were 1.14 mg/kg/h (IQR, 0.88-1.55 mg/kg/h) and 0.06 μg/kg/min (IQR, 0.04-0.08 μg/kg/min), respectively. Intraoperative BIS values had risen temporarily > 60 in eight patients (21.6%) despite administration of 2 mg/kg/h of remimazolam; thus, they were treated with supplementary midazolam. The median recovery time was 7 min (IQR, 5-8 min) after 40 min (IQR, 40.0-57.5 min) of total mean anesthesia time. There was no correlation between the infusion dose of remimazolam and recovery profiles, such as recovery time, final BIS of anesthesia, modified observer assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale or post-anesthesia recovery (PAR) score when arriving at the PACU, and length of stay in the PACU (all P > 0.05).
Remimazolam can be combined with remifentanil without an NMBA in female patients who undergo hysteroscopic surgery, during which a supraglottic airway is a feasible method to protect the airway.

This study aimed to verify whether this method can be useful in case of higher initial TBCs to reduce induction time.
Forty-five patients scheduled to undergo oral surgery under IVS with propofol were randomly divided into three groups (group 1, TCI started with TBC set at 2.2 μg/ml; group 2, TBC was set at 2.6 μg/ml; group 3, TBC was set at 3.0 μg/ml). Immediately after reading the calculated brain concentration when the target sedation was achieved (value A), the initial TBC was manually reset to value A. We manually controlled the intraoperative TBC to maintain moderate sedation, according to the clinical signs and bispectral index values. Of the regulated TBC values, the value farthest from value A was defined as value B. The maximum discrepancy between values B and A and the induction time were compared among the three groups.
The maximum discrepancy (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) was significantly larger in group 3 (1.0 ± 1.3 μg/ml, p = .005) and group 2 (0.8 ± 0.2 μg/ml p = .008) than in group 1 (0.5 ± 0.3 μg/ml). The induction time (mean ± SD) was significantly shorter in group 3 (124 ± 126 min, p = .004) and group 2 (135 ± 33 min, p = .006) than in group 1 (245 ± 1913 min). With the initial TBC set at 2.6 μg/ml, the maximum discrepancy was large at 0.8 μg/ml, but with a small SD (0.2 μg/ml).

Quality of recovery is an important component of health care quality, but there is no published randomized control trial focused on the quality of recovery in patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia with remimazolam.
This parallel-group, single-blind randomized control trial at a tertiary care medical center in South Korea was conducted to determine the difference in the quality of recovery between the patients administered remimazolam and those administered an inhalant anesthetic agent. A total of 168 patients aged 19-65 years who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy or robotic gynecologic surgery were considered for enrollment. Randomization was performed using sealed envelopes containing computer-generated random allocation sequences. Remimazolam was administered for the maintenance of anesthesia in the remimazolam group (Group R), and desflurane was administered in the desflurane group (Group D). The induction protocol and the target value of the bispectral index were identical in both groups. Patients were blinded to the drug that was administered until they finished the postoperative questionnaire. The main outcome measure was the decrement of the QoR-40 score on postoperative day 1 compared to the QoR-40 score on the day before surgery.
A total of 165 patients were analyzed. The preoperative and postoperative global QoR-40 scores were 183 and 152 (IQR 173-192 and 136-169), respectively. The perioperative decrement of the global QoR-40 score was 29.96 ± 22.49. The decrement of the QoR-40 score was smaller in Group R than in Group D (26.99 versus 32.90, respectively; mean difference 5.91, 95% confidence interval -0.96-12.79). After adjustment for sex, the type of surgery and surgical time, the administration of remimazolam resulted in a 7.03-point (95% CI 0.35-13.72) less decrement of the QoR-40 score than desflurane. There were no severe adverse events in either group.
Total intravenous anesthesia maintained with remimazolam provides a better quality of recovery than anesthesia maintained with an inhalant agent in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Additionally, postoperative nausea and vomiting were largely reduced with remimazolam.

Laser laryngeal surgery (LLS) requires the administration of low levels of oxygen, which may increase the risk of desaturation and brain function impairment. This prospective randomized trial aimed to compare the effects of desflurane and propofol-based general anesthesia on the occurrence of early postoperative cognitive decline in elderly patients undergoing LLS.
Seventy-three patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II and at least 65 years of age were randomly allocated to receive either desflurane-based (Group D) or propofol-based (Group P) anesthesia during LLS. The standard anesthesia protocol was performed, with a bispectral index between 40 and 60 and a mean arterial pressure within 20% of baseline values. Intraoperative regional oxygen saturation values were recorded. Each patient was assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) test during the preoperative period (baseline), 30 min after extubation in the postanesthesia care unit, and 1, 3, and 24 h after surgery.
MMSE scores improved slightly in both groups compared to baseline during the early postoperative period, but these increases were not statistically significant. No significant differences were identified in MMSE scores between groups. Only three patients (9.6%) in group D and one patient (3.1%) in group P developed cognitive impairment (p = 0.583).
Low intraoperative inspired oxygen concentration during short-duration LLS did not reduce early postoperative cognitive function in elderly patients. Desflurane or propofol-based anesthesia had similar effects on early neurocognition after LLS.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effective dose of remimazolam tosilate induction and explore its correlation with the bispectral index (BIS).
A total of 42 elderly patients were divided into two age groups: 60-69 (group A) and 70-85 (group B) years. An initial dose of 0.1mg/kg(Group A) and 0.05 mg/kg(Group B) remimazolam tosilate was administered, and the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale was used to assess adequate responses. The dose was calculated using the up-and-down allocation technique based on the previous response. The sequential formula and probit regression model were used to calculate ED50 and BIS50. ED95 was determined using the probit regression model.
The ED50 of remimazolam tosilate for anesthesia induction were 0.088 mg/kg (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.071-0.108) and 0.061 mg/kg (95% CI 0.053-0.069) in groups A and B, respectively.

The primary aim of the study was to compare the response of the Bispectral Index (BIS) during emergence from anesthesia maintained by xenon and sevoflurane. To better understand the variation in response of pEEG to these agents, we also compared several EEG derived parameters relevant to pEEG monitoring during emergence. Twenty-four participants scheduled for lithotripsy were randomized to receive xenon or sevoflurane anesthesia. Participants were monitored with the BIS and had simultaneous raw EEG collected. BIS index values were compared at three key emergence timepoints: first response, eyes open and removal of airway. Two sets of EEG derived parameters, three related to the BIS: relative beta ratio, SynchFastSlow and SynchFastSlow biocoherence, and two unrelated to the BIS: spectral edge frequency and the composite cortical state, were calculated for comparison. BIS index values were significantly lower in the xenon group than the sevoflurane group at each emergence timepoint. The relative beta ratio parameter increased significantly during emergence in the sevoflurane group but not in the xenon group. The spectral edge frequency and composite cortical state parameters increased significantly in both groups during emergence. The BIS index is lower at equivalent stages of behavioural response during emergence from xenon anesthesia when compared to sevoflurane anesthesia, most likely due to differences in how these two agents influence the relative beta ratio. The spectral edge frequency and composite cortical state might better reflect emergence from xenon anaesthesia.Clinical trial number and registry Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Number: ACTRN12618000916246.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441313/

This study was designed to compare the sevoflurane consumption at 2 rates of flow and vaporizer concentration during the wash-in period.
Patients were randomly enrolled into high FGF (HFGF) (n = 30) and low FGF (LFGF) (n = 30) groups. During the wash-in, the HFGF group received 4 L/minute FGF with a sevoflurane vaporizer setting of 2.5%, and the LFGF group received 1 L/minute FGF with a vaporizer setting of 8%.

Remimazolam is a new ultra-short-acting intravenous benzodiazepine sedative/anesthetic, which is a high-selective and affinity ligand for the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor. However, no study has reported the pharmacodynamics of remimazolam in patients with obstructive jaundice. We hypothesize that obstructive jaundice affects the pharmacodynamics of remimazolam, and the sensitivity of remimazolam increases among icteric patients.
The study will be performed as a prospective, controlled, multicenter trial. The study design is a comparison of remimazolam requirements to reach a bispectral index of 50 in patients with obstructive jaundice versus non-jaundiced patients with chronic cholecystitisor intrahepatic bile duct stones. Remimazolam was infused at 6 mg/kg/h until this endpoint was reached.
Remimazolam could be suitable for anesthesia of patients with obstructive jaundice, because remimazolam is not biotransformed in the liver. Hyperbilirubinemia has been well-described to have toxic effects on the brain, which causes the increasing of sensitivity to some anesthetics, such as desflurane, isoflurane, and etomidate. Furthermore, remimazolam and etomidate have the same mechanism of action when exerting an anesthetic effect. We aim to demonstrate that obstructive jaundice affects the pharmacodynamics of remimazolam, and the dose of remimazolam when administered to patients with obstructive jaundice should be modified.

There has been great interest in the anesthesia community regarding whether variables generated by commercially available processed EEG monitors originally marketed to prevent awareness under anesthesia can be used to guide intraoperative anesthetic management to prevent POCD. Processed EEG monitors represent an opportunity for anesthesiologists to directly monitor the brain even if they have not been trained to interpret EEG waveforms. There is continued equipoise regarding whether any of the variables generated by the machines' interpretation of raw data are associated with POCD. Most literature has focused on the depth of anesthesia number, however recent studies have shown that processed depth may not be accurate in older age groups due to reduced alpha band power. Burst suppression is an encephalographic pattern of high voltage activity alternating with periods of electrical silence and is another marker of depth which can be obtained from commercial processed EEG monitors. We performed a prospective cohort study to determine whether burst suppression and burst suppression ratio as measured by the BIS Monitor (Bispectral Index, BIS Medtronic, Boulder CO), is associated with cognitive dysfunction 3 months after surgery. We recruited 167 elective surgery patients, 65 years of age and older, anticipated to require at least 2 day inpatient admission. Our main outcome measure was cognitive decline in composite z-score on the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center UDS Battery of at least 1 standard deviation 3 months after surgery relative to preoperative baseline. 14% experienced POCD, this group was older (72 [70, 74] versus 70 [67, 75] years), and had frailty scores as measured by the FRAIL Scale (2 [0, 3] versus 1 [0, 2]) and lower baseline z-scores (- 0.2 [- 0.6, 0.5] versus 0.1 [- 0.3, 0.5]). There was a univariable association between suppression ratio > 10 (SR > 10) and POCD (4.8 [0, 37.3] versus 15.4 [4.0-142.4] min), p = .038. However, after adjustment this relationship did not persist, only anesthetic technique, age, and pain remained in the model. In our cohort of older elective noncardiac surgery patients we found a marginal association between processed burst suppression (total burst suppression p = .067, SR > 5 p = .052, SR > 10.038) which did not persist in a multivariable model. Patients with POCD had almost twice the number of minutes of burst suppression, and three times the amount of time for SR > 5 and > 10. Our finding may be a limitation of the monitor's ability to detect burst suppression. The consistent trend towards more intraoperative burst suppression in patients who developed POCD suggests that future studies are needed to investigate the relationship of raw intraoperative burst suppression and POCD.Trial registry Clinical trial number and registry URL: Optimizing Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction in the Elderly-PRESERVE, Clinical Trials Gov# NCT02650687; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02650687 .",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34862586/

Our objective was to correlate SctO 2 with cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) measured using positron emission tomography; OEF is the ratio between cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen and cerebral oxygen delivery and reflects the balance between these 2 variables.
This cohort study was based on data collected in a previously published trial assessing phenylephrine versus ephedrine treatment in anesthetized patients undergoing brain tumor surgery. The variables of interest were measured twice over the healthy hemisphere before surgery: the first measurement performed after anesthesia induction and the second measurement performed after induction of a ∼20% increase in blood pressure using either phenylephrine or ephedrine.
Data from 24 patients were analyzed. The overall vasopressor-induced relative changes in SctO 2 (ΔSctO 2 ) and OEF (ΔOEF) were 3.16% [interquartile range, -0.73% to 6.04%] and -12.5% [interquartile range, -24.0% to -6.19%], respectively. ΔSctO 2 negatively correlated with ΔOEF after phenylephrine treatment (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [ rs ]=-0.76; P =0.007), ephedrine treatment ( rs =-0.76; P =0.006), and any treatment ( rs =-0.79; P <0.001). ΔSctO 2 significantly associated with ΔOEF based on multivariable analysis with ΔOEF, relative changes in mean arterial pressure, arterial blood oxygen tension, and the bispectral index as covariates ( P =0.036).
The negative correlation between changes in SctO 2 and OEF suggests that SctO 2 may reflect the cerebral metabolic demand-supply balance during vasopressor treatment.

This prospective observational study included 60 patients extubated in either the prone (n=30) or supine (n=30) positions. Heart rate, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, train of four values, and bispectral index values were measured and recorded in all patients during operation and at the time of anesthetic agent discontinuation, before and after extubation. The Aldrete recovery score was recorded together with the severity of cough during emergence and recovery. Sore throat visual analog scale (VAS) score was recorded at the first and sixth hours after extubation. Incidents such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory failure, uncontrolled airway, and decreased saturation were also recorded.
The number and severity of cough (p < 0.05) and sore throat VAS (p < 0.001) were lower in the prone group. Postextubation breath holding was more frequent in the supine group (p < 0.001). Aldrete recovery scores were higher in the prone group (p < 0.05). Heart rate and mean arterial pressure values were not significantly different in the prone group during the emergence and recovery period as compared with the supine group (p > 0.05).
Extubation in the prone position after lumbar spinal surgery provides more comfortable emergence and recovery periods with less alteration of respiratory status and a better recovery profile.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34859839/

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients after hip fracture surgery and to identify risk factors for such, as part of developing a risk stratification index (RSI) system to predict a patient's risk of postoperative delirium.
Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) with hip fractures who had received surgical treatment in our hospital between March 2018 and December 2019 were retrospectively included. Clinical data were collected, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the relevant risk factors of postoperative delirium. An RSI system was developed based on factors identified in the regression analysis.
Of 272 patients included, 52 (19.12%) experienced postoperative delirium. Drinking history (> 3/ week), the perioperative lactic acid level (Lac > 2 mmol/L), postoperative visual analog score (VAS) > 3, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status > II, application of the bispectral index, and preoperative diabetes were independent risk factors of postoperative delirium. When RSI ≥ 5, the rate of postoperative delirium significantly increased (p < .05).
The RSI system developed here can safely guide postoperative outcomes of elderly patients with hip fractures, and RSI ≥ 5 may be able to predict the onset of postoperative delirium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34806823/

However, in the event of surgeries requiring a frontal approach, placement of the electrode may be impossible at the designated area to achieve a proper BIS measurement.
We developed an investigational interface device to connect needle-electrodes to BIS sensors. The safety and clinical performance were investigated in patients who underwent surgery. Direct BIS values from a disposable BIS electrode and indirect values via the interface device were simultaneously recorded from the same areas of electrode placement in a single patient. The agreement between the direct and indirect BIS values was statistically analyzed.
The interface device with a silver electrode demonstrated sufficient electric conduction to transmit electroencephalogram signals. The overall BIS curves were similar to those of direct BIS monitoring. Direct and indirect BIS values from 18 patients were statistically analyzed using a linear mixed model and a significant concordance was confirmed (indirect BIS = 7.0405 + 0.8286 * direct BIS, p<0.0001). Most observed data (2582/2787 data points, 92.64%) had BIS unit differences of 10 or less.

Most studies were conducted under general anesthesia or in cognitively impaired patients. It is unclear whether reducing depth of anesthesia beyond levels consistent with general anesthesia reduces delirium in cognitively intact patients. The authors' objective was to determine whether a bundled approach to reduce anesthetic agent exposure as determined by Bispectral Index (BIS) values (spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values) compared with general anesthesia (masked BIS) reduces delirium.
Important eligibility criteria for this parallel-arm randomized trial were patients 65 yr or greater undergoing lumbar spine fusion. The intervention group received spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation to BIS greater than 60 to 70. The control group received general anesthesia (masked BIS). The primary outcome was delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method daily through postoperative day 3, with blinded assessment.
The median age of 217 patients in the analysis was 72 (interquartile range, 69 to 77). The median BIS value in the spinal anesthesia with targeted sedation based on BIS values group was 62 (interquartile range, 53 to 70) and in the general anesthesia with masked BIS values group was 45 (interquartile range, 41 to 50; P < 0.001).

This indicates that there is an urgent need to moderate the level of anesthesia. Recently deep learning (DL) methods have played a major role in estimating the depth of Anesthesia (DOA) of patients and has played an essential role in control anesthesia overdose. In this paper, Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been used for the prediction of DOA. EEG signals are very complex signals which may require months of training and advanced signal processing techniques. It is a point of debate whether DL methods are an improvement over the already existing traditional EEG signal processing approaches. One of the DL algorithms is Convolutional neural network (CNN) which is very popular algorithm for object recognition and is widely growing its applications in processing hierarchy in the human visual system. In this paper, various decomposition methods have been used for extracting the features EEG signal. After acquiring the necessary signals values in image format, several CNN models have been deployed for classification of DOA depending upon their Bispectral Index (BIS) and the signal quality index (SQI). The EEG signals were converted into the frequency domain using and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). However, because of the inter mode mixing observed in EMD method; EEMD have been utilized for this study. The developed CNN models were used to predict the DOA based on the EEG spectrum images without the use of handcrafted features which provides intuitive mapping with high efficiency and reliability. The best trained model gives an accuracy of 83.2%. Hence, this provides further scope and research which can be carried out in the domain of visual mapping of DOA using EEG signals and DL methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34517477/

Objective, reliable tools are needed to guide treatment decisions and prioritize resources.
This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the bispectral index (BIS) in comatose patients with severe brain injury.
This was a retrospective cohort study of 84 patients with severe brain injury and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 8 and less treated from January 2015 to June 2017. Sedatives were withheld at least 24 hr before BIS scoring. The BIS value, GCS scores, and Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) were monitored hourly for 48 hr. Based on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score, the patients were divided into poor (GOS score: 1-2) and good prognosis groups (GOS score: 3-5). The correlation between BIS and prognosis was analyzed by logistic regression, and the receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted.
The mean (SD) of the BIS value: 54.63 (11.76), p = .000; and GCS score: 5.76 (1.87), p = .000, were higher in the good prognosis group than in the poor prognosis group. Lower BIS values and GCS scores were correlated with poorer prognosis. Based on the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal diagnostic cutoff value of the BIS was 43.6, and the associated sensitivity and specificity were 85.4% and 74.4%, respectively.
Taken together, our study indicates that BIS had good predictive value on prognosis. These findings suggested that BIS could be used to evaluate the severity and prognosis of severe brain injury.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34491945/

Sodium thiopental (STP) is still the first choice for induction of anesthesia in some countries for this obstetric surgery. We aimed to compare two doses of STP with regarding the depth of anesthesia and the condition of newborn infants.
In this clinical trial, parturient undergoing elective Caesarian section were randomized into two groups receiving either low-dose (5 mg/kg) or high-dose (7 mg/kg) STP. Muscle relaxation was provided with succinylcholine 2 mg/kg and anesthesia was maintained with O2/N2O and sevoflurane. The depth of anesthesia was evaluated using isolated forearm technique (IFT) and bispectral index (BIS) in various phases. Additionally, infants were assessed using Apgar score and neurobehavioral test.
Forty parturient were evaluated in each group. BIS was significantly lower in high-dose group at skin incision to delivery and subcutaneous and skin closure. Also, significant differences were noticed in IFT over induction to incision and incision to delivery. Apgar score was significantly lower in high-dose group at 1 min after delivery. Newborn infants in low-dose group had significantly better outcomes in all three domains of the neurobehavioral test.
7 mg/kg STP is superior to 5 mg/kg in creating deeper hypnosis for mothers. However, it negatively impacts Apgar score and neurobehavioral test of neonates. STP seems to has dropped behind as an acceptable anesthetic in Cesarean section.

A recent study reported that during general surgery, the given concentration of volatile anaesthetics, expressed as a fraction of the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC fraction), decreases by around only 3% per age-decade, which is less than the 6% expected from age-adjusted MAC. Paradoxically, despite the excessive dosing, Bispectral index (BIS) values also increased.
We planned to investigate the paradox of age when using the Narcotrend depth of anaesthesia monitor.
Secondary analyses of a prospective observational study.
Tertiary hospital in Switzerland, recordings took place during 2016 and 2017.
One thousand and seventy-two patients undergoing cardiac surgery entered the study, and 909 with noise-free recordings and isoflurane anaesthesia were included in this analysis.
We calculated mean end-tidal MAC fraction and mean index value of the Narcotrend depth of sedation monitor used in the study during the prebypass period. Statistical associations were modelled using linear regression, local weighted regression (LOESS) and a generalised additive model (GAM).
Primary endpoints in this study were the change in end-tidal MAC fraction and mean Narcotrend index values, both measured per age-decade.
We observed a linear decrease in end-tidal MAC fraction of 3.2% per age-decade [95% confidence interval (CI) -3.97% to -2.38%, P < 0.001], consistent with previous findings. In contrast to the BIS, mean Narcotrend index values decreased with age at 3.0 index points per age-decade (95% CI, -3.55 points to -2.36 points, P < 0.001), a direction of change commensurate with the increasing age-adjusted MAC fraction with patient age. These relationships were consistent regardless of whether age-adjusted MAC was displayed on the anaesthetic machine.
We caution that the 'paradox of age' may in part depend on the choice of depth of sedation monitor.

Suppressive actions of the brain to terminate the seizure are thought to be necessary for the efficacy of ECT. On the other hand, recent studies showed an association of burst suppression in general anesthesia or sedation with (postprocedural) cognitive complications.
We retrospectively examined the length of postictal burst suppression and reorientation time in 49 ECT sessions of 25 consecutive patients. Burst suppression duration was determined by bispectral index monitoring and defined as the time with a bispectral index value of less than 20%. The association between duration of burst suppression and reorientation time was analyzed with multivariate logistic and linear regression analysis controlling for several covariates.
The reorientation time showed a statistically significant association with the duration of burst suppression, but with no other variable. Longer phase of postictal burst suppression predicted longer reorientation time in the recovery room (P = 0.046).
The association between the duration of postictal burst suppression and reorientation time after ECT in this sample suggests that (not only the efficacy but also the) cognitive adverse effects of ECT might be related to the extent of postictal central inhibition after the termination of the seizure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34294649/

The brain's response to anesthetic drugs is often measured clinically by processed electroencephalogram (EEG) indices. Thus, we developed a processed EEG-based measure of the brain's resistance to volatile anesthetics and hypothesized that low scores on it would be associated with postoperative delirium risk.
We defined the Duke Anesthesia Resistance Scale (DARS) as the average bispectral index (BIS) divided by the quantity (2.5 minus the average age-adjusted end-tidal minimum alveolar concentration [aaMAC] inhaled anesthetic fraction). The relationship between DARS and postoperative delirium was analyzed in 139 older surgical patients (age ≥65) from Duke University Medical Center (n = 69) and Mt Sinai Medical Center (n = 70). Delirium was assessed by geriatrician interview at Duke, and by research staff utilizing the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) instrument at Mt Sinai. We examined the relationship between DARS and delirium and used the Youden index to identify an optimal low DARS threshold (for delirium risk), and its associated 95% bootstrap confidence bounds. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the relationship between low DARS and delirium risk.
The relationship between DARS and delirium risk was nonlinear, with higher delirium risk at low DARS scores. A DARS threshold of 28.755 maximized the Youden index for the association between low DARS and delirium, with bootstrap 95% confidence bounds of 26.18 and 29.80. A low DARS (<28.755) was associated with increased delirium risk in multivariable models adjusting for site (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 4.30 [1.89-10.01]; P = .001), or site-plus-patient risk factors (OR [95% CI] = 3.79 [1.63-9.10]; P = .003). These associations with postoperative delirium risk remained significant when using the 95% bootstrap confidence bounds for the low DARS threshold (P < .05 for all). Further, a low DARS (<28.755) was associated with delirium risk after accounting for opioid, midazolam, propofol, phenylephrine, and ketamine dosage as well as site (OR [95% CI] = 4.21 [1.80-10.16]; P = .002). This association between low DARS and postoperative delirium risk after controlling for these other medications remained significant (P < .05) when using either the lower or the upper 95% bootstrap confidence bounds for the low DARS threshold.
These results demonstrate that an intraoperative processed EEG-based measure of lower brain anesthetic resistance (ie, low DARS) is independently associated with increased postoperative delirium risk in older surgical patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34252066/

These include postoperative cognitive dysfunction or delirium as well as cerebrovascular accidents. During surgery, it is essential to ensure an adequate degree of sedation and analgesia, and at the same time, to provide hemodynamic and respiratory stability in order to minimize neurological complications. In this context, the role of neuromonitoring in the operating room is gaining interest, even in the non-neurolosurgical population. The use of multimodal neuromonitoring can potentially reduce the occurrence of adverse effects during and after surgery, and optimize the administration of anesthetic drugs. In addition to the traditional focus on monitoring hemodynamic and respiratory systems during general anesthesia, the ability to constantly monitor the activity and maintenance of brain homeostasis, creating evidence-based protocols, should also become part of the standard of care: in this challenge, neuromonitoring comes to our aid. In this review, we aim to describe the role of the main types of noninvasive neuromonitoring such as those based on electroencephalography (EEG) waves (EEG, Entropy module, Bispectral Index, Narcotrend Monitor), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) based on noninvasive measurement of cerebral regional oxygenation, and Transcranial Doppler used in the perioperative settings in non-neurosurgical intervention.

However, the clinical assessment of anesthetic depth may not always agree with available processed EEG indices. To concurrently compare the performance of BIS and SedLine monitors, we present a data collection system using shared individual generic sensors connected to a custom-built passive interface box.
This prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized study will enroll 100 adult American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-III patients presenting for elective procedures requiring general anesthesia. BIS and SedLine electrodes will be placed preoperatively according to manufacturer recommendations and their respective indices tracked throughout anesthesia induction, maintenance and emergence. The concordance between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthesia depth will be analyzed with chi-square and kappa statistic.
Prior studies comparing brain function monitoring devices have applied both sensors on the forehead of study subjects simultaneously. With limited space and common sensor locations between devices, it is not possible to place both commercial sensor arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations, thus compromising the validity of these comparisons. This trial utilizes a custom interface allowing signals from sensors to be shared between BIS and SedLine monitors to provide an accurate comparison. Our results will also characterize the degree of agreement between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthetic depth as determined by the anesthesiologists' interpretations of acute changes in blood pressure and heart rate as well as the administration, or change to the continuous delivery, of medications at these timepoints. Patient factors (such as burst suppression state or low power EEG conditions from aging brain), surgical conditions (such as use of electrocautery), artifacts (such as electromyography), and anesthesia medications and doses (such as end-tidal concentration of volatile anesthetic or hypnotic infusion dose) that lead to lack of agreement will be explored as well.

However, precise and real-time estimation of DOA index for painful surgical operations is challenging due to problems such as postoperative complications and accidental awareness. To tackle these problems, we propose a new combinatorial deep learning structure involving convolutional neural networks (inspired by the inception module), bidirectional long short-term memory, and an attention layer. The proposed model uses the EEG signal to continuously predicts the bispectral index (BIS). It is trained over a large dataset, mostly from those under general anesthesia with few cases receiving sedation/analgesia and spinal anesthesia. Despite the imbalance distribution of BIS values in different levels of anesthesia, our proposed structure achieves convincing root mean square error of 5.59 ± 1.04 and mean absolute error of 4.3 ± 0.87, as well as improvement in area under the curve of 15% on average, which surpasses state-of-the-art DOA estimation methods.

Few studies have compared EEG monitors on data from the same patient. Here, we describe a set-up to simultaneously compare the performance of three processed EEG monitors using pre-recorded EEG signals from older surgical patients.
A playback system was designed to replay EEG signals into three different commercially available EEG monitors. We could then simultaneously calculate indices from the SedLine® Root (Masimo Inc., Irvine, CA, USA; patient state index [PSI]), bilateral BIS VISTA™ (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA; bispectral index [BIS]), and Datex Ohmeda S/5 monitor with the Entropy™ Module (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA; E-entropy index [Entropy]). We tested the ability of each system to distinguish activity before anaesthesia administration (pre-med) and before/after loss of responsiveness (LOR), and to detect suppression incidences in EEG recorded from older surgical patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers. We show examples of processed EEG monitor output tested on 29 EEG recordings from older surgical patients.
All monitors showed significantly different indices and high effect sizes between comparisons pre-med to after LOR and before/after LOR. Both PSI and BIS showed the highest percentage of deeply anaesthetised indices during periods with suppression ratios (SRs) > 25%. We observed significant negative correlations between percentage of suppression and indices for all monitors (at SR >5%).
All monitors distinguished EEG changes occurring before anaesthesia administration and during LOR. The PSI and BIS best detected suppressed periods. Our results suggest that the PSI and BIS monitors might be preferable for older patients with risk factors for intraoperative awareness or increased sensitivity to anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33640118/

Literature suggests that current treatments administered in TBI care, in the intensive care unit (ICU), fail to greatly impact recorded cerebrovascular reactivity measures. In particular, the impact of sedation on cerebrovascular reactivity in traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unclear in vivo. The goal of this study was to preliminarily assess the relationship between objectively measured depth of sedation and cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI.
Within, we describe a case series of 5 adult TBI patients with TBI, during which objective high-frequency physiology for sedation depth, using bispectral index (BIS), and both intracranial pressure (ICP) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) were recorded. Pressure reactivity index (PRx) and RAP (a metric of cerebral compensatory reserve) were derived. Relationships between cerebrovascular reactivity and compensatory reserve monitoring with BIS metrics were explored using descriptive plots.
A total of 5 cases in our prospectively maintained database with high-frequency physiology for ICP, ABP, and BIS. Through error bar plotting, it can be seen that each patient displays a parabolic relationship between BIS and PRx. This suggests a potential ""optimal"" depth of sedation where cerebrovascular reactivity is the most intact.
This small series highlights the potential impact of depth of sedation on cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI. It suggests that there may be an individual optimal depth of sedation, so as to optimize cerebrovascular reactivity. Further study of objective depth of sedation and its impact on cerebrovascular physiology in TBI is required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33404872/

Hence, it is speculated that acupuncture may have a sedative effect. However, existing studies employed acupuncture in combination with anesthetics, which makes determine acupuncture's role in producing sedation difficult. In this work, we investigated the sedative effect of acupuncture by using transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TAES) at bilateral Zusanli (ST36), Shenmen (HT7) and Sanyinjiao (SP6). Using a cross-over design, 2 separate sessions, that are, the resting and TAES sessions, were conducted for each subject. The sedative effect was quantified by using the bispectral index (BIS). The difference in brain activities between resting and TAES sessions was investigated by analyzing the simultaneously recorded EEG signals. Our results showed that a statistically significant difference in BIS values existed between resting and TAES sessions, which suggested that TAES alone was capable of inducing observable sedation. Using power spectrum analysis, we showed that TAES-induced sedation was accompanied by a reduction in alpha band power and an increment in delta band power. Permutation entropy was lower during the TAES session, which suggested that TAES reduced the complexity of the EEG signal. Moreover, a significant reduction in the global strength of brain functional connections was observed during TAES. These findings suggest that TAES alone can induce observable sedative effects, and this sedation effect is accompanied by changes in brain activities that have shown to be correlated with consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33256427/

The purpose of this study was to compare the safety of dexmedetomidine-remifentanil and propofol-remifentanil during monitored anesthesia care (MAC) for hysteroscopy.
Female patients undergoing hysteroscopy were randomly assigned to either the dexmedetomidine (group D) or the propofol group (group P). The study drug (0.6 ml/kg; dexmedetomidine 2 μg/ml or propofol 4 mg/ml) was loaded for 10 minutes followed by 0.1 to 0.5 ml/kg/hour to maintain a bispectral index of 60 to 80 during the procedure. In both groups, remifentanil was infused using a target-controlled-infusion system with a target concentration of 2 ng/ml and titrated during the procedure. The incidence rates of intraoperative respiratory depression in both groups were compared. Postoperative pain and patients satisfaction were also compared.

Overexposure to general anesthetics can have adverse effects such as inadequate emergence and postoperative delirium (PD). This study aimed to compare the effects of BIS-guided individualized anesthesia with standard general anesthesia on emergence and delirium after esophagectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data on 161 elderly patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer were retrospectively obtained from electronic medical records. We performed propensity score matching analysis between patients receiving individualized anesthesia (BIS value maintained at about 10 less than the value at LOC) and those receiving standard anesthesia (BIS value maintained at 40-60). In addition, we conducted univariate and multivariate logistic -analyses in the entire cohort. RESULTS Patients receiving individualized anesthesia had higher BIS values and a lower propofol requirement during surgery than those receiving standard general anesthesia (P<0.05). The overall incidences of inadequate emergence and PD were 37.9% and 18.0% (n=161), respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent risk factors for PD were organic brain disease (odds ratio [OR] 6.308; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.458-16.187) and inadequate emergence (OR 4.063; 95% CI 1.645-10.033). CONCLUSIONS BIS-guided individualized anesthesia (lighter) does not reduce inadequate emergence or PD compared with standard general anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing esophagectomy.

Each device has unique strengths and weaknesses. A growing body of evidence questions the ability of a pEEG-derived numerical indices to consistently, rapidly, and reliably quantify consciousness and prevent AWR in patients under general anesthesia. In light of this evidence, there are new developments in the arena of anesthetic depth monitors that may enable anesthesia providers to quickly and easily interpret real-time electroencephalography (EEG) changes using the EEG spectrogram anesthetic signature analysis method. The ease of use and speed of interpretation of the spectrogram anesthetic signature is much improved over raw EEG waveform analysis.

Three resting-state EEG datasets were used in the study (N = 29, N = 21 and N = 20). We estimated the pre-anesthesia strength and fluctuations of frontal-parietal functional connectivity by using sliding-window analysis. Propofol served as the sole anesthetic drug, and it was administered by using a target-controlled infusion system. Individual susceptibility to propofol was assessed by the induction time, from infusion onset until a bispectral index value of 60 was reached, for subjects in dataset-1 and dataset-2, and susceptibility was assessed by behavioral data for subjects in the external dataset.
We observed in the three datasets that subjects with high susceptibility to propofol had lower pre-anesthesia strength and lower fluctuation of frontal-parietal functional connectivity than the low-susceptibility group at alpha band. Moreover, the induction time was significantly correlated with the estimated pre-anesthesia frontal-parietal functional connectivity measures. We also validated the robustness of these findings by using different window lengths in sliding-window analysis.
Subjects with weaker pre-anesthesia dynamic frontal-parietal communication are more likely to be anesthetized.
These observations suggest that the titration procedure for propofol should consider the pre-anesthesia brain functional state.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32927212/

In the present study, we assessed changes in PLE along with the level of consciousness during the induction of general anesthesia using propofol. PLE was compared with the bispectral index (BIS), which is currently the most commonly used index of consciousness.After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent, we enrolled 15 patients (8 men, 7 women; mean age: 37 ± 9 years; mean height: 168 ± 8 cm; mean weight; 68 ± 11 kg) undergoing nasal bone reduction. PLE and BIS sensors were attached simultaneously, and general anesthesia was induced via target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol. PLE and BIS scores were recorded when the calculated effect site concentration shown on the TCI pump was equal to the target concentrations of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, 3.4, and 3.5 μg/mL (and at each 0.1 μg/mL increase, thereafter). Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scores were also recorded until unconsciousness was achieved. Throughout the anesthesia period, all pairs of PLE and BIS data were collected using data acquisition software.The partial correlation coefficients between OAA/S scores and PLE, and between OAA/S scores and BIS were 0.778 (P < .001) and 0.846 (P < .001), respectively. Throughout the period of anesthesia, PLE and BIS exhibited a significant positive correlation. The partial correlation coefficient prior to the loss of consciousness was 0.838 (P < .001), and 0.669 (P < .001) following the loss of consciousness. Intra-class correlation between the 2 indices was 0.889 (P < .001) and 0.791 (P < .001) prior and following the loss of consciousness, respectively.PLE exhibited a strong and predictable correlation with both BIS and OAA/S scores.

In this study, we investigated the association between the real variability of regional cerebral oxygen saturation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and postoperative delayed neurocognitive recovery in patients undergoing heart valve surgery.
A total of 71 patients who underwent cardiac valve surgery were enrolled in this study. Patients were assessed for cognitive function using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MOCA) on the day before surgery and the 7th day after surgery. The real variability of regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2), real variability of the brain bispectral index of EEG (BIS), real variability of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and body temperature were monitored during CPB. Patients were divided into two groups according to neural cognitive function scores to explore the relationship between postoperative delayed neurocognitive recovery and the real variability of cerebral oxygen saturation, BIS, MAP, and body temperature during CPB.
Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed with postoperative delayed neurocognitive recovery. The occurrence of postoperative delayed neurocognitive recovery after surgery was closely related to the large variability of rSO2 during the rewarming phase of CPB (P < .05). Logistic analysis showed that preoperative arrhythmia, a lower level of serum albumin after surgery and greater rSO2 variability during the rewarming phase were risk factors for postoperative delayed neurocognitive recovery (P < .05). In this study, there was no correlation between postoperative delayed neurocognitive recovery and BIS, MAP or body temperature variability (P > .05).

Techniques that reduce anaesthetic drug dose requirements in children may thus enhance the safety of paediatric sedation or anaesthesia. Brainwave entrainment, notably in the form of auditory binaural beats, has been shown to have sedative effects in adults. We evaluated the influence of brainwave entrainment on propofol dose requirements for sedation in children.
We randomised 49 boys scheduled for sub-umbilical surgery under caudal blockade to an entrainment or a control group. Small differences in pitch were applied to each ear to create binaural beats, supplemented by synchronous visual stimuli, within the electroencephalographic frequency bands seen during relaxation and (rapid eye movement/non-rapid eye movement) sleep. After establishment of caudal block, propofol infusion was started at 5 mg kg
Mean propofol infusion rates were 3.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-3.6) mg kg
Brainwave entrainment effectively reduced the propofol infusion rates required for sedation in children undergoing surgery with regional anaesthesia. Further studies are needed to investigate the possibility of phasing out propofol infusions completely during longer surgical procedures and optimising the settings of brainwave stimulation.

Pearson correlation coefficient between the BIS and CAI was 0.825. The result of fitting the semiparametric regression models is the method CAI estimate (-0.00995; P = .0341). It is the estimated difference in the mean of the dependent variable between method BIS and CAI.

During surgery, total intravenous anesthesia was performed with propofol and synthetic opioid sufentanil. The bispectral index was targeted (40 to 60).
The MMN was found in all awake volunteers and validated by an N250 component. In the patient group, the electroencephalogram analysis was not possible in 4 of 11 patients because of anesthesia being too deep, burst suppression, or a high level of noise (>40 μV). Significant N250 response was obtained in 5 of 7 (71.4%) patients under general anesthesia. The 2 other patients also showed MMN which did not reach significance.
To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that phonological processing can be measured during brain surgery under general anesthesia, suggesting that some language processing persists under the condition of unconsciousness. These results encourage further study of language processing under general anesthesia with the goal of making intraoperative neuromonitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31738193/

One hundred patients who received selective RATS under general anesthesia were recruited and assigned into control group (C) and dexmedetomidine group (D). The anesthesia induction and maintenance were consistent between groups. Midazolam, sufentanil, propofol and rocuronium were intravenously injected for anesthesia induction, followed by mechanical ventilation after endotracheal intubation. Sevoflurane inhalation at a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 0.5 was administered, propofol and remifentanil were intravenously injected to maintain the bispectral index (BIS) at 40-60, and rocuronium was intravenously injected once every 30 min. In the D group, dexmedetomidine was intravenously injected after endotracheal intubation, and then it was injected before the end of surgery. In the C group, normal saline of equal volume was injected. The hemodynamic parameters, blood loss, urine volume, time of surgery, time of anesthesia, total dose of propofol, time of thoracic tube indwelling, hospital stay and pulmonary complications were recorded; blood gas analysis was performed after extubation; the QoR-15 and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) questionnaires were employed for the assessment of mental status at 1 and 3 days after surgery.
The mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and brain oxygenation were similar between groups at different time points (P>0.05). There were no significant differences in the operation time, time of anesthesia and intra-operative urine volume between groups. As compared to the C group, the blood loss and dose of propofol reduced significantly (P<0.05). After extubation, the respiratory frequency reduced and PaO2 increased markedly (P<0.05). After surgery, the time of thoracic tube indwelling and hospital stay reduced dramatically in the D group as compared to the C group (P<0.05). The QoR-15 score and MMSE score in the D group were markedly higher than in the C group (P<0.05).

31557307,Bispectral index for improving intraoperative awareness and early postoperative recovery in adults.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2019,"Lewis SR, Pritchard MW, Fawcett LJ, Punjasawadwong Y","The use of clinical signs, or end-tidal anaesthetic gas (ETAG), may not be reliable in measuring the hypnotic component of anaesthesia and may lead to either overdosage or underdosage resulting in adverse effects because of too deep or too light anaesthesia. Intraoperative awareness, whilst uncommon, may lead to serious psychological disturbance, and alternative methods to monitor the depth of anaesthesia may reduce the incidence of serious events. Bispectral index (BIS) is a numerical scale based on electrical activity in the brain. Using a BIS monitor to guide the dose of anaesthetic may have advantages over clinical signs or ETAG. This is an update of a review last published in 2014.
To assess the effectiveness of BIS to reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness and early recovery times from general anaesthesia in adults undergoing surgery.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science on 26 March 2019. We searched clinical trial registers and grey literature, and handsearched reference lists of included studies and related reviews.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which BIS was used to guide anaesthesia compared with standard practice which was either clinical signs or end-tidal anaesthetic gas (ETAG) to guide the anaesthetic dose. We included adult participants undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia regardless of whether included participants had a high risk of intraoperative awareness. We included only studies in which investigators aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BIS for its role in monitoring intraoperative depth of anaesthesia or potential improvements in early recovery times from anaesthesia.
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE.
We included 52 studies with 41,331 participants; two studies were quasi-randomized and the remaining studies were RCTs. All studies included participants undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. Three studies recruited only participants who were at high risk of intraoperative awareness, whilst two studies specifically recruited an unselected participant group. We analysed the data according to two comparison groups: BIS versus clinical signs; and BIS versus ETAG. Forty-eight studies used clinical signs as a comparison method, which included titration of anaesthesia according to criteria such as blood pressure or heart rate and, six studies used ETAG to guide anaesthesia. Whilst BIS target values differed between studies, all were within a range of values between 40 to 60.BIS versus clinical signsWe found low-certainty evidence that BIS-guided anaesthesia may reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness in a surgical population that were unselected or at high risk of awareness (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.60; I
Intraoperative awareness is infrequent and, despite identifying a large number of eligible studies, evidence for the effectiveness of using BIS to guide anaesthetic depth is imprecise. We found that BIS-guided anaesthesia compared to clinical signs may reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness and improve early recovery times in people undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia but we found no evidence of a difference between BIS-guided anaesthesia and ETAG-guided anaesthesia. We found six studies awaiting classification and two ongoing studies; inclusion of these studies in future updates may increase the certainty of the evidence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31557307/

The reason causing awareness was unclear. Insufficient anaesthetic dosing was thought as the principal cause. Even awareness was not comprehensively understood, some endeavors have been raised to prevent or reduce it, including i) Reducing the insufficient anaesthetic dosing induced by negligence; ii) Providing close clinical observation and clinical parameters from the monitor such as bispectral index or electroencephalogram, as well as isolated forearm technique and passive brain-computer interface may bring some effects sometimes.

However, there are currently a lack of effective preventive measures to reduce the risk of secondary brain injury. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) vs sufentanil during percutaneous tracheostomy in TBI patients.
The 196 TBI patients who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy were randomized divided into 3 groups: group D1 (n = 62, DEX infusion at 0.5 μg·kg for 10 minutes, then adjusted to 0.2-0.7 μg·kg·hour), group D2 (n = 68, DEX infusion at 1 μg·kg for 10 minutes, then adjusted to 0.2-0.7 μg·kg·hour), and group S (n = 66, sufentanil infusion 0.3 μg·kg for 10 minutes, then adjusted to 0.2-0.4 μg·kg·hour). The bispectral index (BIS) of all patients was maintained at 50 to 70 during surgery. Anesthesia onset time, hemodynamic variables, total cumulative dose of DEX/sufentanil, total doses of rescue propofol and fentanyl, time to first dose of rescue propofol and fentanyl, number of intraoperative patient movements and cough reflexes, adverse events, and surgeon satisfaction score were recorded.
Anesthesia onset time was significantly lower in group D2 than in both other groups (14.35 ± 3.23 vs 12.42 ± 2.12 vs 13.88 ± 3.51 minutes in groups D1, D2, and S, respectively; P < .001). Both heart rate and mean arterial pressure during percutaneous tracheostomy were more stable in group D2. Total doses of rescue propofol and fentanyl were significantly lower in group D2 than in group D1 (P < .001). The time to first dose of rescue propofol and fentanyl were significantly longer in group D2 than in both other groups (P < .001). The number of patient movements and cough reflexes during percutaneous tracheostomy were lower in group D2 than in both other groups (P < .001). The overall incidences of tachycardia and hypertension (which required higher doses of esmolol and urapidil, respectively) were also lower in group D2 than in both other groups (P < .05). Three patients in group S had respiratory depression compared to X in the D1 group and X in the D2 group. The surgeon satisfaction score was significantly higher in group D2 than in both other groups (P < .05).
During percutaneous tracheostomy, compared with sufentanil, DEX (1 μg·kg for 10 minutes, then adjusted to 0.2-0.7 μg·kg·hour) can provide the desired attenuation of the hemodynamic response without increased adverse events. Consequently, DEX could be used safely and effectively during percutaneous tracheostomy in TBI patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31464960/

One possible reason is that the reverse of neuromuscular blockade affects electromyographic (EMG) signals of fascial muscle. Another reason is, the afferentation theory, the reverse of neuromuscular blockade relieves block signals generated in muscle stretch receptors from accessing the brain through afferent nerve pathways and induces arousal. Inaccurate BIS value may lead to overdose of drugs or the risk of intraoperative awareness. We compared changes in BIS and EMG values according to neuromuscular blockade reversal agents under steady-state desflurane anesthesia. A total of 65 patients were randomly allocated to receive either neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg, sugammadex 4 mg/kg, or pyridostigmine 0.25 mg/kg for neuromuscular blockade reversal under stable desflurane anesthesia, and 57 patients completed the study. The primary outcome was change in BIS and EMG values before and after administration of neuromuscular blockade reversal agents (between train-of-four [TOF] count 1-2 and TOF ratio 0.9). The change in BIS and EMG values before and after administration of neuromuscular blockade reversal agents were statistically different in each group (BIS: Neostigmine group, P < 0.001; Sugammadex group, P < 0.001; Pyridostigmine group, P = 0.001; EMG: Neostigmine group, P = 0.001; Sugammadex group, P < 0.001; Pyridostigmine group, P = 0.001; respectively). The BIS and EMG values had a positive correlation (P < 0.001). Our results demonstrate that the EMG and BIS values have increased after neuromuscular blockade reversal under desflurane anesthesia regardless of the type of neuromuscular blockade reversal agent.

It has been widely used for monitoring depth of anesthesia (DoA). In this study, we propose a method that combines multiple EEG-based features with artificial neural network (ANN) to assess the DoA. Multiple EEG-based features can express the states of the brain more comprehensively during anesthesia. First, four parameters including permutation entropy, 95% spectral edge frequency, BetaRatio and SynchFastSlow were extracted from the EEG signal. Then, the four parameters were set as the inputs to an ANN which used bispectral index (BIS) as the reference output. 16 patient datasets during propofol anesthesia were used to evaluate this method. The results indicated that the accuracies of detecting each state were 86.4% (awake), 73.6% (light anesthesia), 84.4% (general anesthesia), and 14% (deep anesthesia). The correlation coefficient between BIS and the index of this method was 0.892 ( p < 0.001 ).

Neurophysiological variability indicates compromised regulation and organization of neural networks. Based on theories of neuronal integrity changes that accompany aging, we assessed the relative contribution of: 1) premorbid cognitive reserve, 2) current brain integrity (gray and white matter markers of neurodegenerative disease), and 3) current cognition (specifically domains of processing speed/working memory, episodic memory, and motor function) on intraoperative neurophysiological variability as measured from a common intraoperative tool, the Bispectral Index Monitor (BIS).
This sub-study included participants from a parent study of non-demented older adults electing unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) with the same surgeon and anesthesia protocol, who also completed a preoperative neuropsychological assessment and preoperative 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Left frontal two-channel derived EEG via the BIS was acquired preoperatively (un-medicated and awake) and continuously intraoperatively with time from tourniquet up to tourniquet down. Data analyses used correlation and regression modeling.
Fifty-four participants met inclusion criteria for the sub-study. The mean (SD) age was 69.5 (7.4) years, 54% were male, 89% were white, and the mean (SD) American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 2.76 (0.47). We confirmed that brain integrity positively and significantly associated with each of the cognitive domains of interest. EEG intra-individual variability (squared deviation from the mean BIS value between tourniquet up and down) was significantly correlated with cognitive reserve (r = -.40, p = .003), brain integrity (r = -.37, p = .007), and a domain of processing speed/working memory (termed cognitive efficiency; r = -.31, p = .021). Hierarchical regression models that sequentially included age, propofol bolus dose, cognitive reserve, brain integrity, and cognitive efficiency found that intraoperative propofol bolus dose (p = .001), premorbid cognitive reserve (p = .008), and current brain integrity (p = .004) explained a significant portion of intraoperative intra-individual variability from the BIS monitor.

In this pharmacodynamic study, we investigate the first use of RSM with bispectral index (BIS) to predict patient's response to name calling (RNC) and wakefulness (complete neurological tests) during AC.
The study is performed in two phases. We prospectively enrolled 40 patients who received video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) using propofol and fentanyl as the modeling group. Effect-site concentrations (Ce) and BIS values were recorded and a RSM is built from the data set. We verified the RSM retrospectively in AC patients, designated as the validation group. Corresponding BIS values were analyzed for RNC and wakefulness.

This study investigated the association between depth of anesthesia and POCD in elderly patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
A total of 120 patients aged 60 years or older who were planned for abdominal surgery under total intravenous anesthesia were included in this study. The depth of anesthesia was guided by monitoring Bispectral Index (BIS) data. All study participants completed a battery of nine neuropsychological tests before surgery and at 7 days and 3 months after surgery. POCD was calculated by using the reliable change index. Plasma concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10, S-100β, and norepinephrine (NE) were measured.
The incidence of POCD at 7 days after surgery in the deep anesthesia group was 19.2% (10/52), which was significantly lower (p = 0.032) than the light anesthesia group 39.6% (21/53).

These monitors use ratios of high to low frequency power which assumes that each neurological process contributes a unique frequency pattern. However, recent research of the effect of deep brain stimulation on EEG beta oscillations suggests that wave shape, a non-sinusoidal feature that is only measurable in the time-domain, can change the frequency 'signature' of a neurological rhythmical process by the inclusion or removal of harmonic frequencies. If wave shape variations are present in the EEG of anaesthetised patients, then quantitative EEG monitors likely overestimate the anaesthetic drug effect. The purpose of this paper is to investigate alpha-wave shape in the EEG of anaesthetised patients and demonstrate the effect of wave shape on the frequency ratios that are commonly utilised in the BIS quantitative EEG monitor. EEG data, demographic information, and surgery details were collected prospectively from 305 patients undergoing a general anaesthetic for elective surgery. Alpha-wave shape was categorised by triangularity of the EEG extrema, a measure of how peaked (towards a sawtooth wave) or flat (towards a square wave) the extremum was. The alpha-wave was then artificially modified to either a sawtooth wave or square wave, and BetaRatio and PowerFastSlow metrics calculated. Age was found to be the only significant predictor of alpha wave triangularity. The artificially modified square-alpha waves increased the power in the frequency spectrum at 26 Hz by 1-5 dB, and increased the BetaRatio by 0.7. The alpha-wave of anaesthetised patients contains non-sinusoidal components which likely impact depth of anaesthesia calculations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30671894/

This study aimed to assess the influence of depth of anesthesia on CCEP to establish its clinical utility.
Twenty patients with brain tumors or epilepsy who underwent awake craniotomy were included in this study. Before resection, the electrode plates were placed on the frontal and temporoparietal cortices, and 1-Hz alternating electrical stimuli were delivered to the pars opercularis/pars triangularis in a bipolar fashion. Electrocorticograms from the temporoparietal cortices time-locked to stimuli were averaged to obtain CCEP responses from a state of deep anesthesia until the awake state. The correlation between CCEP waveforms and bispectral index (BIS) was evaluated.
CCEP amplitude increased with the increase in the BIS level. CCEP latency decreased in 5 patients and increased in 15 patients under anesthesia compared with the awake state. CCEP amplitudes decreased by 11.3% to 75.2% (median 31.3%) under anesthesia with <65 BIS level. These differences were statistically significant (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). With respect to CCEP latencies, there was no significant difference between the awake and anesthetic states.
CCEP amplitudes were correlated with depth of anesthesia, whereas CCEP latencies were not affected by anesthesia. The influence of anesthesia should be considered when applying this technique to intraoperative monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30576824/

However, its effect on intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IOM) during brain tumor surgery remains controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of DEX on IOM during brain tumor surgery.
Seventy-eight consecutive patients (DEX group, n = 40; control group, n = 38), who underwent brain tumor surgery with IOM, were retrospectively reviewed. The outcomes included the predictability, laterality of alterations, and stimulation parameters of transcranial motor evoked potentials (tcMEPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs).
The predictability of tcMEPs for postoperative motor outcomes showed a higher false-positive rate in the DEX group than in the control group (27.5% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.047). Bilateral alterations were observed only in the DEX group (31.3%; P = 0.053). Compared with the control group, the DEX group required significantly higher intensity (377.5 ± 48.0 vs. 347.1 ± 30.0 mV; P = 0.001) and repetition rate (6.0 ± 0.2 vs. 5.7 ± 0.5 pulse/train; P = 0.001) of transcranial electric stimulation to evoke adequate tcMEPs. The SSEP results were comparable between both groups. In the DEX group, false-positive tcMEPs changes occurred 222.2 ± 70.5 minutes (range, 95-342 minutes) after the induction of anesthesia. In addition, the patients who were administered DEX under bispectral index monitoring (n = 12) showed a significantly higher false-positive rate than shown by the control group (50.5% vs. 5.3%; P = 0.003).
This study showed that DEX had significant effects on tcMEPs during IOM in brain tumor surgery. Because the high false-positive rate could decrease the accuracy of IOM, outcomes after using DEX should be cautiously interpreted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30496923/

With increased focus on detecting the anesthesia states of patients in the course of surgery, more attention has been paid to analyzing the power spectra and entropy measures of EEG signal during anesthesia. In this paper, by using the relative power of EEG frequency bands and the EEG entropy measures, a new method for detecting the depth of anesthesia states has been presented based on the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers. EEG signals were recorded from 20 patients before, during and after general anesthesia in the operating room at a sampling rate of 200 Hz. Then, 12 features were extracted from each EEG segment, 10 s in length, which are used for anesthesia state monitoring. No significant difference was observed (p > 0.05) between these features and the bispectral index (BIS), which is the commonly used measure of anesthetic effect. The used LS-SVM classifier based method is able to identify the anesthesia states with an accuracy of 80% with reference to the BIS index. Since the underlying equation of the utilized LS-SVM is linear, the computational time of the algorithm is not significant and therefore it can be used for online application in operation rooms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30338496/

Bispectral index (BIS) is a relatively new technique, based on the analysis of the electroencephalographic signal, which provides a good approximation to the level of consciousness, having already been validated in anesthesia.
The objective of the study was to evaluate the utility of BIS in the assessment of the intensity of hypercapnic encephalopathy in ECOPD patients.
A total of ten ECOPD patients were included, and the level of brain activity was assessed using BIS and different scales: Glasgow Coma Scale, Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS), and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. The evaluation was performed both in the acute phase and 3 months after discharge.
BIS was recorded for a total of about 600 minutes. During ECOPD, BIS values ranged from 58.8 (95% CI: 48.6-69) for RSS score of 4 to 92.2 (95% CI: 90.1-94.3) for RSS score of 2. A significant correlation was observed between values obtained with BIS and those from the three scales, although the best fit was for RSS, followed by Glasgow and Richmond (

Fifteen men aged >60 years (mean, 70 years) were selected. Propofol target-controlled infusion was performed under EEG bispectral index monitoring. The propofol target effect-site concentration, blood pressure, heart rate, and distributions and powers of the EEG spectrum were recorded in an awake state and under anesthesia. The EEG included seven bands: delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (4.0-7.0 Hz), alpha-1 (7.5-9.5 Hz), alpha-2 (10-12 Hz), beta-1 (13-23 Hz), beta-2 (24-34 Hz), and gamma (35-45 Hz).
From an awake state to anesthesia, the brain topographic map showed that the energies of delta, theta, alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta-1 were concentrated in the frontoparietal site, and the power increased significantly. The energy distribution of beta-2 was significantly decreased and the power significantly reduced. The energy distribution of gamma in the temporal lobe was also markedly decreased and the power significantly reduced.

Off-label use of Bispectral Index within context and limitations for conditions other than depth of anesthesia.,Minerva anestesiologica,2019,Dahaba AA,"Numerous articles appeared in literature using brain function monitors (BFM), such as Bispectral Index (BIS) to assess cerebral cognitive conditions not related to depth of anesthesia. BIS cannot be considered a ""true"" reflection of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal nor an independent measure of brain function. BIS algorithm was retrospectively derived from EEG changes with incremental doses of γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)ergic anesthetic agents while measuring 3 descriptors. In many instances we are confronted with BIS values that do not concur with clinically judged anesthetic state arising from an underlying alteration of the patients' own EEG. Because BIS is an EEG derived parameter; conditions that can ""alter"" the raw EEG signal would subsequently change BIS to reflect other unrelated EEG events of patient-dependent pathophysiologic perturbations. Could we use BIS monitor outside the scope of the operating room to ""grade"" other EEG conditions? Actually the answer to that seems to be a ""very cautious"" yes. Because BIS is a rather appealing scale from 100 to 0, it is tempting to find numerical cut-off values for conditions that are already clinically graded like West Haven hepatic encephalopathy. Having said that I strongly argue against going as far as using BIS in Critical Care Unit (CCU) setting, there are too much heterogeneity and many disease states in the CCU patients, other than sedatives /hypnotics, that would strongly influence BIS values, in effect rendering BIS not only useless most of the time but can also be misleading.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30226034/

However, the distinct EEG dynamic characteristics at comparable sedation levels have not been well studied, resulting in potential interpretation errors in EEG monitoring during sedation. We aimed to analyze the EEG dynamics of dexmedetomidine and propofol at comparable sedation levels and to explore EEG changes with increased sedation levels for each agent. We measured the Bispectral Index (BIS) and 20-channel EEG under dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation from wakefulness, moderate sedation, and deep sedation to recovery in healthy volunteers (n = 10) in a randomized, 2-day, crossover study. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels. Despite similar changes in increased delta oscillations, multiple differences in the EEG spatiotemporal dynamics were observed between these two agents. During moderate sedation, both dexmedetomidine and propofol induced increased spindle power; however, dexmedetomidine decreased the global alpha/beta/gamma power, whereas propofol decreased the alpha power in the occipital area and increased the global spindle/beta/gamma power. During deep sedation, dexmedetomidine was associated with increased fronto-central spindle power and decreased global alpha/beta/gamma power, but propofol was associated with increased theta/alpha/spindle/beta power, which was maximized in the frontal area. The transition of topographic alpha/spindle/beta power distribution from moderate sedation to deep sedation completely differed between these two agents. Our study demonstrated that there was a distinct hierarchy of EEG changes with increased sedation depths by propofol and dexmedetomidine. Differences in EEG dynamics at the same sedation level might account for differences in the BIS value and reflect the different sedation mechanisms. EEG-based clinical sedation monitoring should consider the effect of drug types on EEG dynamics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29920532/

However, whether propofol post-conditioning provides neuroprotection in human beings has never been explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of propofol post-conditioning on oxidative stress and post-operative cognitive function following aneurysm clipping.
Sixty patients undergoing intracranial aneurysm clipping were randomized into a propofol post-conditioning group or a sevoflurane group. Sevoflurane (0.5-2%) was used for maintenance anesthesia in both groups. In the propofol post-conditioning group, the inhaled concentration of sevoflurane was reduced after temporary clip removal to keep the bispectral index (BIS) value between 40 and 60, and propofol (Cp 1.2 µg/mL) was subsequently started. Blood samples were drawn at six time points: before induction, immediately after clip removal, at the end of the operation, 24-h post-surgery, 3 days post-surgery, and 7 days post-surgery. Oxidative stress and cognitive function were measured.
Between the conclusion of the operation to 7 days after surgery, propofol post-conditioning decreased the serum concentration of •OH and 8-isoprostane and increased γ-tocopherol and SOD. Reduced micronuclei and nucleoplasmic bridges were observed in the propofol post-conditioning group. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores were improved by propofol post-conditioning compared to the group that received no propofol.
Together, our data suggest that propofol post-conditioning (Cp 1.2 µg/mL) may protect the brain from oxidative stress injury up to 7 days post-surgery after temporary parent artery clipping. Furthermore, the neuroprotection induced by propofol post-conditioning may contribute to improvement in cognitive function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29882696/

Adult brain-injured patients undergoing mechanical ventilation were enrolled. Nociceptive (endotracheal suctioning) and non-nociceptive (gentle touching) procedures were performed in a random crossover fashion. Before and immediately after the procedure, CPOT was evaluated by 2 residents and 2 chief nurses, and BIS was documented. The ability to self-report pain was also assessed.

We investigated the relationship between BIS value and eye position in 32 children who underwent surgery for epiblepharon under general anesthesia. BIS values were recorded continuously throughout the procedure (from induction to awakening). Eye positions were video-recorded and analyzed after surgery. The vertical position of each eye was scored according to its height in relation to the medial canthus. An eye position in which the upper eyelid covered one-third of the cornea was defined as a significant ocular elevation.
The BIS value correlated inversely with the end-tidal concentration of each anesthetic agent, whereas it correlated positively with the eye elevation score (eye position = 0.014 × BIS + 0.699, p = 0.011). The mean eye position score was significantly greater in patients whose BIS values were over 65. Eleven patients (34.4%) had significant ocular elevation; their mean concurrent BIS value was 61.6. Two of these patients had elevation during surgery and 9 had elevation during emergence from anesthesia.
We found that high BIS values were correlated with low levels of anesthetic concentration and high eye position, suggesting that BIS monitoring may be useful for predicting eye position during anesthesia. Particular attention must be given to eye position during ophthalmic surgery.

The present study is targeted to estimate the depth of anaesthesia using cognitive signal processing and intelligent modeling techniques. The neurophysiological signal that reflects cognitive state of anaesthetic drugs is the electroencephalogram signal. The information available on electroencephalogram signals during anaesthesia are drawn by extracting relative wave energy features from the anaesthetic electroencephalogram signals. Discrete wavelet transform is used to decomposes the electroencephalogram signals into four levels and then relative wave energy is computed from approximate and detail coefficients of sub-band signals. Relative wave energy is extracted to find out the degree of importance of different electroencephalogram frequency bands associated with different anaesthetic phases awake, induction, maintenance and recovery. The Kruskal-Wallis statistical test is applied on the relative wave energy features to check the discriminating capability of relative wave energy features as awake, light anaesthesia, moderate anaesthesia and deep anaesthesia.

The aim is to adjust the drug dose to the real patient needs using heuristic knowledge provided by clinicians. A two-level computer decision system is proposed. The idea is to release the clinician from routine tasks so that he can focus on other variables of the patient.
The controller uses the Bispectral Index (BIS) to assess the hypnotic state of the patient. Fuzzy controller was included in a closed-loop system to reach the BIS target and reject disturbances. BIS was measured using a BIS VISTA monitor, a device capable of calculating the hypnosis level of the patient through EEG information. An infusion pump with propofol 1% is used to supply the drug to the patient. The inputs to the fuzzy inference system are BIS error and BIS rate. The output is infusion rate increment. The mapping of the input information and the appropriate output is given by a rule-base based on knowledge of clinicians.
To evaluate the performance of the fuzzy closed-loop system proposed, an observational study was carried out. Eighty one patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery were randomly distributed in 2 groups: one group using a fuzzy logic based closed-loop system (FCL) to automate the administration of propofol (42 cases); the second group using manual delivering of the drug (39 cases).

In this study, we aimed to identify an accurate and simple bedside method to predict awareness recovery after severe acute ischemic stroke.
Between 2013 and 2017, all consecutive patients with consciousness disorders after acute ischemic stroke were recruited to the study. The demographic data, Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Bispectral Index (BIS) were recorded at study entry and each day of Days 3-8 during the stroke period. We followed patients for 90days to assess whether the subjects recovered conscious awareness. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to evaluate the predictors' abilities for outcome prognosis.
We assessed a total of 102 patients. 23 (23%) patients died without awareness recovery, whereas 61 (60%) patients regained conscious awareness. The earliest time with the greatest ability to predict conscious awareness recovery occurred at Day 3 after stroke, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the multivariate model was 0.948 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.885 to 0.982). Age, BIS, motor response and brainstem responses were independent predictors for conscious awareness recovery. We subsequently created a 20-point score termed ""ABMB"" based on their coefficients in the Day 3 model. The AUC of ABMB at Day 3 was 0.931 (95% CI 0.882 to 0.980). The ABMB also showed good predictive ability at Days 4 and 5.
The ABMB score accurately identified patients who will recover conscious awareness within 90days after acute severe ischemic stroke and thus provides a useful outcome message for clinicians and relatives.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29246600/

Yet, types of sedation assessment tools and sedation levels that are suitable for sedation treatment have not been investigated.
To investigate the influence of different sedation levels guided by the Bispectral Index (BIS) on the therapeutic effects for severe TBI.
According to inclusion, exclusion, and rejection criteria, 35 patients were prospectively included and divided into Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), BIS(I), and BIS(II) groups. The RASS group was controlled the level of sedation to within -2 or -3, and the BIS(I) and (II) groups within the range of 40-50 and 50-60, respectively. In addition to clinical data, RASS, BIS, and intracranial pressure (ICP) values were collected. RASS and ICP variability were introduced to investigate the different of sedative control effect with or without BIS monitor, and the control effect of ICP between different sedation levels. Statistical analysis was performed to estimate the effectiveness of different sedation levels guided by BIS in sedation treatment within 72 hours.
There were no significant differences in demographics among the 3 groups. RASS variability of the BIS(I) and (II) groups was significantly lower than that of the RASS group (P < 0.05), and in the BIS(I) group it was insignificantly lower than in the BIS(II) group. The ICP of the BIS(I) and (II) groups declined to <13.5 mm Hg significantly earlier than that of the RASS group (P < 0.05), and the difference between BIS(I) and (II) was insignificant. ICP variability of RASS group was higher than those of the BIS(I) and (II) groups (P < 0.05), and ICP variability of the BIS(I) group was significantly lower than that of the BIS(II) group (P < 0.05). Differences in days in the neurosurgery intensive care unit and outcomes among the 3 groups were insignificant.
BIS is more reliable than RASS for maintaining a stable sedation status and ICP. Deeper sedation levels (BIS 40-50) cause ICP to decrease more quickly, with lower ICP variability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29196250/

However, precise localization of the tracts is sometimes difficult with conventional mapping methods. Thus, the authors developed a novel brain mapping method that enables the 3D recognition of the motor tract for intrinsic brain tumor surgeries. This technique was performed in 40 consecutive patients with gliomas adjacent to motor tracts that have a risk of intraoperative pyramidal tract damage. Motor tracts were electrically stimulated and identified by a handheld brain-mapping probe, the NY Tract Finder (NYTF). Sixteen-gauge plastic tubes were mounted onto the NYTF and inserted in the estimated direction of the motor tract with reference to navigational information. Only the NYTF was removed, leaving the plastic tubes in their places, immediately after muscle motor evoked potentials were recorded at the minimum stimulation current. Motor tracts were electrically identified in all cases. Three-dimensional information on the position of motor tracts was given by plastic tubes that were neurophysiologically placed. Tips of tubes showed the resection limit during tumor removal. Safe tumor resection with an arbitrary safety margin can be performed by adjusting the length of the plastic tubes. The motor tract positioning method enabled the 3D recognition of the motor tract by surgeons and provided for safe resection of tumors. Tumor resections were performed safely before damaging motor tracts, without any postoperative neurological deterioration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29171804/

The aim of this investigation is to study the superiority of the locally infiltrated anesthetic bupivacaine just before the skull pin insertion and the scalp incision in craniotomy under general anesthesia. Methods In the study thirty patients of both genders aged 24-72 years were included. They were categorized as ASA 1 and 2 and divided into two group of 15 patients each, group B (bupivacaine) and group S (saline). We recorded the bispectral (BIS) index, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the pulse rate (PR) in five time intervals: t 0-2 min before pin insertion; t 1-2 min after pin insertion; t 2-5 min after; t 3-10 min after and t 4-15 min after. Results Significant difference p<0.05 was achieved in group S for all three followed parameters: blood pressure, heart rate and bispectral index. The difference is present in all four time intervals compared to the initial one before the pin insertion. With further analysis it was demonstrated that the investigated BIS index participates the most in the overall significance in group F. Conclusion The scalp infiltration with local anesthetic bupivacaine results with stable hemodynamic parameters and stable intracranial pressure during the painful procedures as craniotomy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28991762/

28985693,Assessing the depth of isoflurane anaesthesia during cardiopulmonary bypass.,Perfusion,2018,"Ng KT, Alston RP, Just G, McKenzie C","Bispectral index (BIS) and monitoring of end-tidal concentration may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of awareness during volatile-based general anaesthesia. An analogue of end-tidal concentration during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is measuring exhausted isoflurane concentration from the oxygenator as an estimate to blood and, so, brain concentration. The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between oxygenator exhaust and blood concentrations of isoflurane and the BIS score during CPB when administering isoflurane into the sweep gas supply to the oxygenator.
Seventeen patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery using CPB and isoflurane with BIS monitoring were recruited in a single-centre university hospital. Isoflurane gas was delivered via a calibrated vaporiser at the beginning of anaesthetic induction. Radial arterial blood samples were collected after the initiation of CPB and before aortic cross-clamping, which were analysed for isoflurane by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The BIS score and the concentration of exhausted isoflurane from the oxygenator membrane, as measured by an anaesthetic gas analyser, were recorded at the time of blood sampling.
The mean duration of anaesthetic induction to arterial blood sampling was 90 min (95%CI: 80,100). On CPB, the median BIS was 39 (range, 7-43) and the mean oxygenator exhaust isoflurane concentration was 1.24 ± 0.21%. No significant correlation was demonstrated between BIS with arterial isoflurane concentration (r=-0.19, p=0.47) or oxygenator exhaust isoflurane concentration (r=0.07, p=0.80). Mixed-venous blood temperature was moderately correlated to BIS (r=0.50, p=0.04). Oxygenator exhaust isoflurane concentration was moderately, positively correlated with its arterial concentration (r=0.64, p<0.01).
In conclusion, in patients undergoing heart surgery with CPB, the findings of this study indicate that, whilst oxygenator exhaust concentrations were significantly associated with arterial concentrations of isoflurane, neither had any association with the BIS scores, whereas body temperature has moderate positive correlation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28985693/

We hereby present the clinical case of a 12-month old child with right hemiparesis secondary to prior left middle cerebral artery stroke 8 months ago. The child underwent surgical enlargement of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) with cardiopulmonary bypass. During cardiopulmonary bypass, asymmetric NIRS results were detected between both hemispheres. The utilization of multimodal neuromonitoring (NIRS-BIS) allowed acting on both perfusion pressure and anesthetic depth to balance out the supply and demand of cerebral oxygen consumption. No new neurological sequelae were observed postoperatively. We consider bilateral NIRS monitoring necessary in order to detect asymmetries between cerebral hemispheres. Although asymmetries were not present at baseline, they can arise intraoperatively and its monitoring thus allows the detection and treatment of cerebral ischemia-hypoxia in the healthy hemisphere, which if undetected and untreated would lead to additional neurological damage.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28958609/

However, clinical assessment of brain-death occurence is difficult in post-cardiac arrest patients, sedated, paralyzed, under mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH). Our objective was to assess the usefulness of Bispectral-Index (BIS) monitoring at bedside for an early detection of brain-death occurrence in refractory cardiac arrest patients treated by E-CPR.
This prospective study was performed in an intensive care unit of an university hospital. Forty-six patients suffering from refractory cardiac arrest treated by E-CPR were included. BIS was continuously recorded during ICU hospitalization. Clinical brain-death was confirmed when appropriate by EEG and/or cerebral CT angiography.
Twenty-nine patients evolved into brain-death and had average BIS values under MTH and after rewarming (temperature ≥35°C) of 4 (0-47) and 0 (0-82), respectively. Among these, 11 (38%) entered into a procedure of organs donation. Among the 17 non-brain-dead patients, the average BIS values at admission and after rewarming were 39 (0-65) and 59 (22-82), respectively. Two patients had on admission a BIS value equal to zero and evolved to a poor prognostic (CPC 4) and died after care limitations. BIS values were significantly different between patients who developed brain death and those who did not. In both groups, no differences were observed between the AUCs of ROC curves for BIS values under MTH and after rewarming (respectively 0.86 vs 0.83, NS).
Initial values of BIS could be used as an assessment tool for early detection of brain-death in refractory cardiac arrest patients treated by mild therapeutic hypothermia and E-CPR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28844933/

We experienced severe cerebral infarction caused by paradoxical CO2 embolism during laparoscopic liver resection with injury of the hepatic vessels despite the absence of a right-to-left systemic shunt. CASE REPORT A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in the right hepatic lobe secondary to alcoholic liver disease. We planned the laparoscopy-assisted liver resection. During the surgery, the root of the right hepatic vein was injured. A 1.5-cm hole was accidentally made in the right hepatic vein, while mobilizing the right hepatic lobe laparoscopically. End-tidal CO2 dropped from 39 to 15.5 mmHg, and systemic blood pressure dropped from 121 to 45 mmHg, returning to normal with the administration of inotropes. The transesophageal echocardiography revealed numerous bubbles in the left atrium and ventricle. The Bispectral Index monitoring system showed low brain activity, suggesting cerebral infarction due to paradoxical gas embolism. The hepatectomy was completed by conversion to open laparotomy. The patient went into a coma and suffered quadriplegia after surgery, despite the cooling of his head and the administration of Thiamylal. Brain MRI revealed cerebral infarction in the broad area of the cerebral cortex right side predominantly, with poor blood flow confirmed by the brain perfusion single-photon emission CT. Rehabilitation was gradually achieved with Botox injections. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral infarction by paradoxical gas embolism is a rare complication in laparoscopic surgery, but it is important to be aware of the risk and to be prepared to treat it.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630395/

The goal of this study was to determine if the presence of a frontal brain tumour influences propofol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and existing PK-PD model performance.
Twenty patients with a frontal brain tumour and 20 control patients received a propofol infusion to achieve an induction-emergence-induction anaesthetic sequence. Propofol plasma concentration was measured every 4 min and at each transition of the conscious state. Bispectral index (BIS) values were continuously recorded. We used non-linear mixed-effects modelling to analyse the effects of the presence of a brain tumour on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol. Subsequently we calculated the predictive performance of Marsh, Schnider, and Eleveld models in terms of median prediction error (MdPE) and median absolute prediction error (MdAPE).
Patients with brain tumours showed 40% higher propofol clearance than control patients. Performance of the Schnider model (MdPEpk -20.0%, MdAPEpk 23.4%) and Eleveld volunteer model (MdPEpk -8.58%, MdAPEpk 21.6%) were good. The Marsh model performed less well (MdPEpk -14.3%, MdAPEpk 41.4%), as did the Eleveld patient model (MdPEpk -30.8%, MdAPEpk 32.1%).
Brain tumours might alter the pharmacokinetics of propofol. Caution should be exerted when using propofol TCI in patients with frontal brain tumours due to higher clearance.

Determination of quasi-periodicities in electroencephalogram (EEG) is a candidate for quantifying the changes in the depth of anesthesia (DOA). In this paper, DOA monitoring capacity of periodicities detected using PRSA was quantified by assessing EEG signals collected from 56 patients during surgery. The method is compared with sample entropy (SampEn), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and permutation entropy (PE). The performance of quasi-periodicities defined by deceleration capacity and acceleration capacity was tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Pearson correlation coefficient. During the surgery, a significant difference ( ) in the quasi-periodicities was observed among three different stages under general anesthesia. There is a larger mean AUC and correlation coefficient of quasi-periodicities compared with SampEn, DFA, and PE using expert assessment of conscious level and bispectral index as the gold standard, respectively. Quasi-periodicities detected using PRSA in EEG signals are a powerful monitor of DOA and perform more accurate and robust results compared with SampEn, DFA, and PE.

Power spectral analysis is an important method for feature detection in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Several spectral parameters derived from EEG have been proposed for measuring DOA in clinical applications. In the present paper, an improved method based on phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) is designed to improve the predictive accuracy of relative alpha and beta power, a frequency band power ratio, total power, median frequency (MF), spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), and spectral entropy for assessing anesthetic drug effects. Fifty-six patients undergoing general anesthesia in an operating theatre are studied. All EEG signals are continuously recorded from the awake state to the end of the recovery state and then filtered using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). All parameters are evaluated using the commercial bispectral index (BIS) and expert assessment of conscious level (EACL), respectively. The ability to predict DOA is estimated using the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). All indicators based on the improved method can clearly discriminate the conscious state from the anesthetized state after filtration (p  <  0.05). A significantly larger mean AUC (p  <  0.05) shows that the improved method performs better than the conventional method to measure the DOA in most circumstances. Especially for raw EEG contaminated by artifacts, when the BIS index is used to indicate the consciousness level, the improvement is 7.37% (p  <  0.05), 9.04% (p  <  0.05), 18.46% (p  <  0.05), 27.73% (p  <  0.05), 14.65% (p  <  0.05), 2.52%, 5.38% and 6.24% (p  <  0.05) for relative alpha and beta power, power ratio, total power, MF, SEF, RE and SE, respectively.

27995430,EEG artifacts reduction by multivariate empirical mode decomposition and multiscale entropy for monitoring depth of anaesthesia during surgery.,Medical & biological engineering & computing,2017,"Liu Q, Chen YF, Fan SZ, Abbod MF, Shieh JS","Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely utilized to measure the depth of anaesthesia (DOA) during operation. However, the EEG signals are usually contaminated by artifacts which have a consequence on the measured DOA accuracy. In this study, an effective and useful filtering algorithm based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition and multiscale entropy (MSE) is proposed to measure DOA. Mean entropy of MSE is used as an index to find artifacts-free intrinsic mode functions. The effect of different levels of artifacts on the performances of the proposed filtering is analysed using simulated data. Furthermore, 21 patients' EEG signals are collected and analysed using sample entropy to calculate the complexity for monitoring DOA. The correlation coefficients of entropy and bispectral index (BIS) results show 0.14 ± 0.30 and 0.63 ± 0.09 before and after filtering, respectively. Artificial neural network (ANN) model is used for range mapping in order to correlate the measurements with BIS. The ANN method results show strong correlation coefficient (0.75 ± 0.08). The results in this paper verify that entropy values and BIS have a strong correlation for the purpose of DOA monitoring and the proposed filtering method can effectively filter artifacts from EEG signals. The proposed method performs better than the commonly used wavelet denoising method. This study provides a fully adaptive and automated filter for EEG to measure DOA more accuracy and thus reduce risk related to maintenance of anaesthetic agents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27995430/

This is a prospective, assessor-blinded observational study evaluating patients in the beach chair position undergoing shoulder surgery under regional anesthesia.
University hospital operating room.
Forty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists classes I-II physical status scheduled for elective shoulder surgery.
Cerebral saturation and blood flow of the middle cerebral artery were measured prior to anesthesia and continued after beach chair positioning until discharge to the postanesthesia care unit. The anesthesiologist was blinded for these values. Controlled hypotension with systolic blood pressure≤100mm Hg was maintained during surgery.
Neurobehavioral tests and values of regional cerebral saturation, bispectral index, the mean maximal blood flow of the middle cerebral artery, and invasive blood pressure were measured prior to regional anesthesia, and measurements were repeated after placement of the patient on the beach chair position and every 20 minutes thereafter until discharge to postanesthesia care unit. The neurobehavioral tests were repeated the day after surgery.
The incidence of cerebral desaturation events was 5%. All patients had a significant blood pressure drop 5 minutes after beach chair positioning, measured at the heart as well as the acoustic meatus levels, when compared with baseline values (P<.05). There was no decrease in either the regional cerebral saturation (P=.136) or the maximal blood flow of the middle cerebral artery (P=.212) at the same time points. Some neurocognitive tests showed an impairment 24 hours after surgery (P<.001 for 2 of 3 tests).

27585361,Advances in awareness monitoring technologies.,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2016,"Stein EJ, Glick DB","Initial studies suggested that the use of processed electroencephalogram technology could significantly decrease the incidence of unintended intraoperative awareness events during general anesthesia. Subsequent work has cast doubts on these findings. This review will examine the current state of awareness monitoring.
Recently published randomized controlled trials examining the use of the bispectral index during general anesthesia have not been able to show superiority over other forms of monitoring depth of anesthesia, such as end-tidal anesthetic-agent concentration. Additionally, there is current interest in utilizing the unprocessed electroencephalogram to ascertain depth of anesthesia and recent studies have demonstrated its use in preventing postoperative delirium.
Although awareness monitors such as the bispectral index monitor may have benefit in patients in whom volatile anesthetic agents must be minimized - such as in hemodynamically unstable patients, or patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia - these monitors do not appear to be useful for all patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27585361/

This study was planned to assess the contribution of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring in the depth of anesthesia.
The patients were divided into 2 groups, and BIS monitoring was used for each patient. Group 1 (G1 n=35): keeping the BIS monitor screen open, the anesthesia need was set. Group 2 (G2 n=35): BIS monitor was tied to the patient and the monitor screen was closed in such a way that the anaesthesist couldn't see the BIS value. When the recording time came, the data on the monitor was recorded. The need for the anesthetic agent was set according to the parameters such as haemodynamics or follow up of pupils, instead of BIS value, by titrating the anesthetic infusion doses.
BIS values were similar in both groups before the induction, BIS values in both groups showed a decrease, showing no significant statistical difference (P>0.05). One patient in each group said that he dreamt, and one patient in G2 said that he had heard a noise and felt that he was taken from one place to another.

Obese patients pose significant challenges to anesthesiologists with regard to accurate dosing of anesthetics due to potentially altered pharmacokinetics (PK). Here we determined the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of propofol for anesthesia induction in morbidly obese (MO) subjects (body mass index >35 kg/m(2)) at two dosing regimens: dosing based on total body weight and lean body weight (LBW), respectively. The propofol pharmacokinetic profile was well fitted with a two-compartment model. Both elimination clearance (223%-243% of controls, who had a body mass index <25 kg/m(2); P < 0.01) and peripheral compartment volume (156%-180% of controls; P < 0.01) were significantly increased in MO subjects, resulting in an equal or decreased propofol level in plasma (total body weight-based dosing). Furthermore, propofol PD (measured by the bispectral index) was adequately described by a PK/PD model that linked an effect compartment to the two-compartment PK model through a sigmoidal Emax model. All PD parameters except EC50 values (the half maximal effect concentration) were similar (P > 0.05) between MO subjects and controls. Morbid obesity led to a significant decrease (37.9%-38.6%; P < 0.01) in EC50 values, which suggests increased brain sensitivity to propofol in the MO population. Moreover, dose reduction (i.e., dosing based on LBW) generated identical anesthetic effects in MO subjects compared with controls. In conclusion, morbid obesity significantly altered both PK and PD of propofol. LBW was a better weight-based dosing scalar for anesthesia induction with propofol in MO subjects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27481855/

It requires in-depth understanding of the effect of congenital shunt lesions on the uptake, delivery, and equilibration of anesthetic drugs. Intracardiac shunts can alter the induction time and if delivery of anesthetic agent is not carefully titrated, can lead to overdosing and undesirable myocardial depression.
To study the effect of congenital shunt lesions on the speed of inhalational induction and also the impact of inhalational induction on hemodynamics in the presence of congenital shunt lesions.
Tertiary care hospital.
A prospective, single-center clinical study.
Ninety-three pediatric patients undergoing elective surgery were segregated into three equal groups, namely, Group 1: no CHD, Group 2: acyanotic CHD, and Group 3: cyanotic CHD. General anesthesia was induced with 8% sevoflurane in 6 L/min air-oxygen. The time to induction was noted at loss of eyelash reflex and decrease in bispectral index (BIS) value below 60. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration, minimum alveolar concentration, and BIS were recorded at 15 s intervals for the 1 st min followed by 30 s interval for another 1 min during induction. Hemodynamic data were recorded before and after induction.
Patients in Group 3 had significantly prolonged induction time (99 ± 12.3 s; P < 0.001), almost twice that of the patients in other two groups (51 ± 11.3 s in Group 1 and 53 ± 12.0 s in Group 2). Hypotension occurred after induction in Group 1. No other adverse hemodynamic perturbations were observed.
The time to inhalational induction of anesthesia is significantly prolonged in patients with right-to-left shunt, compared to patients without CHD or those with left-to-right shunt, in whom it is similar.

BIS and ICP values were recorded at the same time. Based on the GCS score, patients were divided into two groups: group A (GCS score 3-≤5) and group B (>5-≤8). Natural survival rates were analyzed statistically and compared between groups.
Chi-square testing revealed a significant difference in survival rates between the groups (P<0.05).

27367415,Intraoperative monitoring of cerebral oximetry and depth of anaesthesia during neuroanesthesia procedures.,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2016,"Badenes R, García-Pérez ML, Bilotta F","This review reports recent evidence on intraoperative monitoring of cerebral oximetry and depth of anaesthesia during neuroanaesthesia procedures.
The clinical benefits of intraoperative monitoring with cerebral oximetry [near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and brain tissue oxygenation monitoring (brptiO2)] and depth of anaesthesia with bispectral index (BIS) have recently been studied in surgical (carotid endarterectomy, cerebral arteriovenous malformations resection and brain tumour resections) and neuroradiological vascular procedures. BrptiO2/PaO2 ratio is much more reliable than absolute brptiO2 readings in detecting hypoxia in arteriovenous malformation resections. NIRS can help clinicians monitor those patients receiving endovascular treatment for acute ischaemic stroke and during carotid endarterectomy, but the value of applying cerebral oximetry in patients with cerebral vasospasm needs to be further evaluated. Awake craniotomy demonstrated that because of considerable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interindividual variation, BIS titration is recommended. Thus, the presence of a frontal brain tumour did not affect ipsilateral BIS values.
Recent studies provide interesting evidence of intraoperative monitoring of NIRS, brptiO2 and BIS. The brptiO2/PaO2 ratio is much more reliable than an absolute brptiO2 reading; NIRS helps clinicians to monitor patients who are undergoing endovascular treatment, and BIS guides the titration of anaesthesia during awake craniotomy; its values are not affected by the presence of a frontal brain tumour.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27367415/

Two different application modes of intravenous anesthesia for AAA craniotomies are widely used: infusion by means of target-controlled infusion (TCI) and traditional manually-controlled infusion (MCI). We conducted this study to examine whether intravenous anesthesia using the TCI system with propofol and remifentanil would be a more effective method than MCI in AAA epilepsy surgery.
This prospective and single center study compared patients undergoing either TCI or MCI techniques for functional AAA epilepsy surgery. 35 cases used TCI including TCI-E (resection of epileptogenic foci in an eloquent area, n = 18) and TCI-M (resection of epileptogenic foci in a motor area, n = 17). Thirty-six cases used MCI including MCI-E (epileptogenic foci in an eloquent area, n = 16) and MCI-M (epileptogenic foci in a motor area, n = 20). Bispectral index value and hemodynamic profiles at different time points during the awake phase were recorded along with time for awakening and the occurrences of adverse events.
The TCI technique significantly shortened intraoperative awakening times during the third phase, TCI-E vs MCI-E 12.82 min ± 6.93 vs 29.9 min ± 9.04 (P = .000) and TCI-M vs MCI-M 16.8 min ± 5.19 vs 30.91 min ± 15.32 (P = .010). During the awake phase, the highest bispectral index score values appeared in the TCI-E group at all-time points. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were more stable in the TCI-E group compared with the MCI-E group during the awake phase. Tachycardia and hypertension were most common in the MCI-E group (52.9% and 29.4%, P = .001 and P = .064).
We found the superiority of TCI, which is faster intraoperative awakening and better hemodynamics along with secure airway management conditions. It is suggested that the TCI technique may be a feasible and effective technique and it might be a viable replacement of the MCI technique for AAA epilepsy surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27290954/

Sedation level can be measured with EEG monitoring with the bispectral index (BIS) monitor.
To determine the feasibility and validity of BIS monitoring in terminally ill patients.
In this prospective study, BIS registrations were performed in unconscious end-of-life patients admitted to a palliative care center. Validated scores were used to measure level of sedation (Ramsay score), pain (Numeric Rating Scale or Rotterdam Elderly Pain Observations Scale), delirium (Delirium Observation Screening score), and overall comfort (Numeric Rating Scale). Validity and sensitivity to change of BIS values were considered, and the effects of medication and the time till death on BIS values were evaluated in a linear mixed model analysis.
Fifty-eight patients were included for analysis. BIS monitoring was acceptable to patients, relatives, and medical staff. BIS values were moderately correlated with Ramsay scores (0.46) but were highly variable for deeply sedated patients. BIS values changed significantly before and after a midazolam dose (P < 0.001). Midazolam treatment resulted on average in a statistically significant reduction of the BIS values (-4.5, 95% CI -7.0 to -2.0), whereas morphine and haloperidol did not.
This is one of the first validation studies in which BIS monitoring in end-of-life patients is described. BIS monitoring is feasible in unconscious terminally ill patients.

High gamma activity (HGA) between 80 and 140 Hz on electrocorticography is assumed to reflect localized cortical processing, whereas the cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) can reflect bidirectional responses evoked by monophasic pulse stimuli to the language cortices when there is no patient cooperation. The authors propose the use of ""passive"" mapping by combining HGA mapping and CCEP recording without active tasks during conscious resections of brain tumors. METHODS Five patients, each with an intraaxial tumor in their dominant hemisphere, underwent conscious resection of their lesion with passive mapping. The authors performed functional localization for the receptive language area, using real-time HGA mapping, by listening passively to linguistic sounds. Furthermore, single electrical pulses were delivered to the identified receptive temporal language area to detect CCEPs in the frontal lobe. All mapping results were validated by ECS, and the sensitivity and specificity were evaluated. RESULTS Linguistic HGA mapping quickly identified the language area in the temporal lobe. Electrical stimulation by linguistic HGA mapping to the identified temporal receptive language area evoked CCEPs on the frontal lobe. The combination of linguistic HGA and frontal CCEPs needed no patient cooperation or effort. In this small case series, the sensitivity and specificity were 93.8% and 89%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The described technique allows for simple and quick functional brain mapping with higher sensitivity and specificity than ECS mapping. The authors believe that this could improve the reliability of functional brain mapping and facilitate rational and objective operations. Passive mapping also sheds light on the underlying physiological mechanisms of language in the human brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26991386/

In this study, the influence of depth of anesthesia on MEP response was assessed. METHODS Twenty-eight patients with brain tumors who underwent awake craniotomy were included in this study. From a state of deep anesthesia until the awake state, MEP amplitude and latency were measured using 5-train electrical bipolar stimulations on the same site of the precentral gyrus each minute during the surgery. The depth of anesthesia was evaluated using the bispectral index (BIS). BIS levels were classified into 7 stages: < 40, and from 40 to 100 in groups of 10 each. MEP amplitude and latency of each stage were compared. The deviation of the MEP measurements, which was defined as a fluctuation from the average in every BIS stage, was also considered. RESULTS A total of 865 MEP waves in 28 cases were evaluated in this study. MEP amplitude was increased and latency was decreased in accordance with the increases in BIS level. The average MEP amplitudes in the > 90 BIS level was approximately 10 times higher than those in the < 40 BIS level. Furthermore, the average MEP latencies in the > 90 BIS level were 1.5-3.1 msec shorter than those in the < 60 BIS level. The deviation of measured MEP amplitudes in the > 90 BIS level was significantly stabilized in comparison with that in the < 60 BIS level. CONCLUSIONS MEP amplitude and latency were closely correlated with depth of anesthesia. In addition, the deviation in MEP amplitude was also correlated with depth of anesthesia, which was smaller during awake surgery (high BIS level) than during deep anesthesia. Therefore, MEP measurement would be more reliable in the awake state than under deep anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26943841/
26895206,Microelectrode recording (MER) findings during sleep-awake anesthesia using dexmedetomidine in deep brain stimulation surgery for Parkinson's disease.,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2016,"Kwon WK, Kim JH, Lee JH, Lim BG, Lee IO, Koh SB, Kwon TH","The preferred choice of anesthesia for deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been local anesthesia due to the need of patients' cooperation during the procedure, and concern on the interference of sedatives on microelectrode recording (MER) results. However, local anesthesia during the whole procedure may be impossible in some patients due to uncontrolled anxiety, fear, delirium or exhaustion. Therefore, sedative drugs have been used for DBS, but findings of MER during the procedures have not been reported in detail, especially in the globus pallidus internus (GPi). We introduce our experience using 'asleep-awake' technique by dexmedetomidine (DEX) anesthesia with MER findings during DBS in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients.
Data from 14 different subcortical nuclei from 8 consecutive IPD patients whom had DBS at the GPi (6 patients) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) (2 patients) were retrospectively reviewed. We used continuous DEX and intermittent small boluses of propofol during the painful procedure ('asleep phase'), accompanied with continuous intraoperative monitorings of bispectral index (BIS) and modified observer's assessment of sedation (MOAA/S). Then sedatives were discontinued during MER recording ('awake phase'). Characteristic findings and firing rates of neurons were analyzed and compared to those from other 6 patients who underwent surgery under local anesthesia.
All patients were satisfactorily sedated using this technique without any respiratory or hemodynamic complications. Characteristics of spike activities of each nucleus were inspected and analyzed quantitatively. We could inspect changes of spike activities according to level of patients' consciousness in some cases, but the localizing value was good to decide the target in all cases. Firing rates of group whom sedatives were given during asleep phase ('sedatives') were significantly lower than those of group under local anesthesia ('no sedative'). Intraoperative length of target nuclei, postoperative imaging and postoperative changes of UPDRS III score indicated satisfactory outcome.
We concluded that though MER findings may change during DEX-based monitored 'sleep-awake' anesthesia, it did not affect the results of target localization for the clinical purpose. However, it should be considered that use of sedatives before MER could result in changes of firing rate and pattern depending on the patient's state of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26895206/

Temperature, BIS, rSO2, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and hematocrit were recorded. Internal jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation and SvO2 were obtained from blood gas analysis at the time points: after induction of anesthesia (T0), beginning of CPB (T1), ascending aortic occlusion (T2), 20 minutes after initiating CPB (T3), coronary reperfusion (T4), separation from CPB (T5), and at the end of operation (T6). The effect of hypothermia or changes in CPP on rSO2, SjvO2, SvO2, and BIS were analyzed.Compared with postinduction baseline values, rSO2 significantly decreased at all-time points: onset of extracorporeal circulation, ascending aortic occlusion, 20 minutes after CPB initiation, coronary reperfusion, and separation from CPB (P < 0.05). Compared with measurements made following induction of anesthesia, SjvO2 significantly increased with initiation of CPB, ascending aortic occlusion, 20 minutes after initiating CPB, coronary reperfusion, and separation from CPB (P < 0.05). Compared with induction of anesthesia, BIS significantly decreased with the onset of CPB, aortic cross clamping, 20 minutes after initiating CPB, and coronary reperfusion (P < 0.05). Bispectral index increased following separation from CPB. There was no significant change in SvO2 during cardiopulmonary bypass (P > 0.05). Correlation analysis demonstrated that rSO2 was positively related to CPP (r = 0.687, P = 0.000), with a low linear correlation to temperature (r = 0.453, P = 0.000). Internal jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation was negatively related to temperature (r = -0.689, P = 0.000). Bispectral index was positively related to both temperature (r = 0.824, P = 0.000) and CPP (r = 0.782, P = 0.000). Cerebral oxygen saturation had a positive linear correlation with CPP and a low linear correlation to temperature. Internal jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation had a negative linear correlation to temperature.Pre-and and early postbypass periods are vulnerable times for adequate cerebral oxygenation.

This study analyzed the relationship between BIS values and AEP indices from different sites on the head to establish alternative sensor locations for AEP recording. Thirty patients scheduled for elective surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia were randomly assigned to the forehead, nose or mandible groups (n = 10 patients per group). AEP sensors were placed at the assigned position for each group and BIS sensors were placed on the forehead. BIS value and AEP index were simultaneously recorded from induction until emergence from general anesthesia. Relationships between BIS values and AEP indices were analyzed using a regression method and compared between groups using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Square regression models better expressed the relationships than linear models in all groups. The z-transformed coefficient in the forehead group was the same as the nose group (p = 0.24) and significantly different in the mandible group (p = 0.0046). These findings suggest that AEPs can be accurately recorded from sensors placed on the nose.

One-lung ventilation (OLV) decreases arterial oxygenation; thus oxygen delivery to the brain can be decreased. In this study, we compared phenylephrine and dopamine with respect to maintaining cerebral oxygenation during OLV in major thoracic surgery.Sixty-three patients undergoing lobectomies were randomly assigned to the dopamine (D) or phenylephrine (P) group. The patients' mean arterial pressure was maintained within 20% of baseline by a continuous infusion of dopamine or phenylephrine. Maintenance fluid was kept at 5 mL/kg/h. The depth of anesthesia was maintained with desflurane 1MAC and remifentanil infusion under bispectral index guidance. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and hemodynamic variables were recorded using near-infrared spectroscopy and esophageal cardiac Doppler.The rScO2 was higher in the D group than the P group during OLV (OLV 60 min: 71 ± 6% vs 63 ± 12%; P = 0.03). The number of patients whose rScO2 dropped more than 20% from baseline was 0 and 6 in the D and P groups, respectively (P = 0.02).

Anesthesia techniques that minimize anesthetic requirements and their effects may be beneficial. Esmolol, a short acting hyperselective β-adrenergic blocker is effective in blunting adrenergic response to several perioperative stimuli and so it might interfere in the effect of the anesthetic drugs on the brain. This study was designed to investigate the effect of esmolol on the consumption of propofol and sevoflurane in patients undergoing craniotomy.
Forty-two patients that underwent craniotomy for aneurysm clipping or tumour dissection were randomly divided in two groups (four subgroups). Anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl and a single dose of cis-atracurium, followed by continuous infusion of remifentanil and either propofol or sevoflurane. Patients in the esmolol group received 500 mcg/kg of esmolol bolus 10 min before induction of anesthesia, followed by additional 200 mcg/kg/min of esmolol. Monitoring of the depth of anesthesia was also performed using the Bispectral Index-BIS and cardiac output. The inspired concentration of sevoflurane and the infusion rate of propofol were adjusted in order to maintain a BIS value between 40-50. Intraoperative emergence was detected by the elevation of BIS value, HR or MAP.
The initial and the intraoperative doses of propofol and sevoflurane were 18-50 mcg/kg/min and 0.2-0.5 MAC respectively in the esmolol group, whereas in the control group they where 100-150 mcg/kg/ and 0.9-2.0 MAC respectively (p = 0.000 for both groups). All procedures were anesthesiologically uneventful with no episodes of intraoperative emerge.
Esmolol is effective not only in attenuating intraoperative hemodynamic changes related to sympathetic overdrive but also in minimizing significant propofol and sevoflurane requirements without compromising the hemodynamic status.

Forty-eight participants were enrolled at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from October 2011 to March 2012 and randomly assigned to a mild or a deep sedation group using computer- generated random numbers. Preliminary tests were performed a week prior to scanning to determine target effect site concentrations based on BIS and concomitant Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scores while under propofol. Within one week of the preliminary tests where propofol dose-response was established, BOLD-fMRI was conducted to examine brain activation with the subject awake, and with propofol infusion at the sedation level.
Mild propofol sedation inhibited left inferior parietal lobe activation. Deep sedation inhibited activation of the left insula, left superior temporal gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus. Compared with mild sedation, deep propofol sedation inhibited activation of the left thalamus, precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate, and right basal nuclei.
Mild and deep propofol sedation are associated with inhibition of different brain regions, possibly explaining differences in the respective loss of consciousness processes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26564411/

In this study, we propose a novel nonlinear method, the permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC) index, which describes the complexity in the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal to quantify the effect of GABAergic anaesthetics on brain activities.We applied the PLZC to two EEG data sets that were recorded under sevoflurane and propofol anaesthesia. The results are compared with traditional mean value-based Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), permutation entropy (PE), composite PE index (CPEI), response entropy (RE), state entropy (SE) and bispectral index (BIS) or SynchFastSlow (SFS, derived from BIS). Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling and prediction probability (Pk) were used to assess the performance of the proposed method for tracking GABAergic anaesthetic concentrations.We found that PLZC correlates closely with the anaesthetic drug effect. When applied in sevoflurane anaesthesia, the coefficient of determination R2 between the PLZC values and the sevoflurane effect site concentrations was (0.90 ± 0.07), mean  ±  standard deviation), and the prediction probability Pk was (0.85 ± 0.04). These values were higher than those for the other indices. While in propofol anaesthesia, the value of R2 between PLZC and the effect site concentrations was (0.89 +/- 0.07), and the Pk was (0.86 +/- 0.28), which were close to those for CPEI but better than those for the others.PLZC based on electroencephalogram signals can be used as a new index to characterize the depth of anaesthesia. This index outperformed LZC, PE, CPEI, RE, SE, and BIS or SFS in tracking drug concentration changes during GABAergic anaesthetics.PLZC is a potentially superior method for applications in intra-operative monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26536480/

The aim of the study was to test the influence of sedation on pulse pressure variation in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients and to compare PPV in critically ill and brain dead patients. Beside the absolute value of PPV, the adjusted values of pulse pressure were used to eliminate influence of ventilation.
Mechanically ventilated patients received four different breath frequencies. At each frequency airway pressure was adjusted to keep the end-tidal CO2 stable. In critically ill patients the frequencies were applied at basal (bispectral index - BIS median 38) and deeper sedation (BIS 29).
Simultaneous haemodynamic and respiratory data including oesophageal pressure were recorded, adjusted PPV were calculated as PPV/VT, PPV/dPair, PPV/dPes where VT is tidal volume, dPair and dPes are airway and oesophageal driving pressures.

Recently, the neurophysiologically based EEG measures of cortical input (CI) and cortical state (CS) have been shown to be prospective indicators of analgesia/antinociception and hypnosis, respectively. In this study, we compared CI and an alternate measure of CS, the composite cortical state (CCS), with the Bispectral Index (BIS) and another recently developed measure of antinociception, the composite variability index (CVI). CVI is an EEG-derived measure based on a weighted combination of BIS and estimated electromyographic activity. By assessing the relationship between these indices for equivalent levels of hypnosis (as quantified using the BIS) and the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance (as determined by the predicted effect-site concentration of remifentanil), we sought to evaluate whether combining hypnotic and analgesic measures could better predict movement in response to a noxious stimulus than when used alone.
Time series of BIS and CVI indices and the raw EEG from a previously published study were reanalyzed. In our current study, the data from 80 patients, each randomly allocated to a target hypnotic level (BIS 50 or BIS 70) and a target remifentanil level (Remi-0, -2, -4 or -6 ng/mL), were included in the analysis. CCS, CI, BIS, and CVI were calculated or quantified at baseline and at a number of intervals after the application of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale and a subsequent tetanic stimulus. The dependency of the putative measures of antinociception CI and CVI on effect-site concentration of remifentanil was then quantified, together with their relationship to the hypnotic measures CCS and BIS. Finally, statistical clustering methods were used to evaluate the extent to which simple combinations of antinociceptive and hypnotic measures could better detect and predict response to stimulation.
Before stimulation, both CI and CVI differentiated patients who received remifentanil from those who were randomly allocated to the Remi-0 group (CI: Cohen's d = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.83; CVI: Cohen's d = 0.72, 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.88). Strong correlations between BIS and CCS were found (at different periods: 0.55 < R2 < 0.68, P < 0.001). Application of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation stimulus was associated with changes in CI and CCS, whereas, subsequent to the application of both stimuli, changes in all measures were seen. Pairwise combinations of CI and CCS showed higher sensitivity in detecting response to stimulation than CVI and BIS combined (sensitivity [99% confidence interval], 75.8% [52.7%-98.8%] vs 42% [15.4%-68.5%], P = 0.006), with specificity for CI and CCS approaching significance (52% [34.7%-69.3%] vs 24% [9.1%-38.9%], P = 0.0159).

However, SampEn only estimates the complexity of signals on one time scale. In this study, a new approach is introduced using multiscale entropy (MSE) considering the structure information over different time scales. The entropy values over different time scales calculated through MSE are applied as the input data to train an artificial neural network (ANN) model using bispectral index (BIS) or expert assessment of conscious level (EACL) as the target. To test the performance of the new index's sensitivity to artifacts, we compared the results before and after filtration by multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). The new approach via ANN is utilized in real EEG signals collected from 26 patients before and after filtering by MEMD, respectively; the results show that is a higher correlation between index from the proposed approach and the gold standard compared with SampEn. Moreover, the proposed approach is more structurally robust to noise and artifacts which indicates that it can be used for monitoring the DOA more accurately.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26491464/

The Wavelet-based Anesthetic Value for Central Nervous System (WAVCNS) index calculated by this monitor is based on wavelet analysis of a normalized electroencephalogram signal in the γ-frequency band. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of disagreement between the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the WAVCNS index during propofol-based and sevoflurane-based maintenance of general anesthesia in a routine surgical population.
Patients undergoing elective surgery were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive either propofol or sevoflurane for the maintenance of anesthesia and remifentanil in both groups. Anesthesiologists were blinded to monitors in both groups. Discordance between the 2 monitors was assessed by the count of discrepancy in recommendation (DR) (type 1 defined as one parameter <40 and the other >60, or type 2 defined as BIS and WAVCNS values on different sides of a threshold [40 or 60]) and also by the proportion of agreement (P0) between WAVCNS and BIS, obtained every 5 seconds, in 3 categories of index (<40, 40-60, and >60).
The analyzed data set consisted of 22 patients (36,872 data pairs) in the propofol group and 24 patients (32,826 data pairs) in the sevoflurane group. The type 1 DR rarely occurred in both the groups (<1%); however, the median (interquartile range) type 2 DR was significantly more frequent in the propofol group (20.6% [7.0-36.9] vs 4.5% [2.3-12.4]; P = 0.0005). The median difference in P0 was 11.53% (95% confidence interval, 0.57-21.32). Major disagreement between WAVCNS index and BIS was related to the weight of burst suppression pattern for the index calculation.
Disagreement between BIS and NeuroSENSE during the maintenance of general anesthesia was worse in the propofol group than that in the sevoflurane groups. The disagreement increases during deep anesthesia or in the occurrence of burst suppression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26489054/

We speculated that PD patients might have abnormal pharmacodynamics due to the degenerative neural system, and the present study was performed to investigate the pharmacodynamics of remifentanil in PD patients.
Two arms of patients were recruited, including 31 PD patients undergoing pulse generator placement after deep brain stimulator implantation and 31 pair-controlled patients undergoing intracranial surgery without PD (NPD). Patients were anesthetized with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. The effective concentration of remifentanil to inhibit responses to intubation and skin incision in 50% and 95% patients (EC50 and EC95) was determined by the up and down method.
Demographic data, bispectral index, and hemodynamic values were similar between the PD and the NPD groups. The average remifentanil concentration used in the PD group for tracheal intubation is significantly lower than in the NPD group (P<0.001). The EC50 for inhibiting the response to tracheal intubation were 1.86 ng/mL (95% confidential interval [CI], 1.77-1.96 ng/mL) in the PD group and 3.20 ng/mL (95% CI, 3.13-3.27 ng/mL) in the NPD group.

Different synchronization measures have their own properties to reflect the changes of EEG activities during different anesthetic states. However, the performance characteristics and the relations of different synchronization measures in evaluating synchronization changes during propofol-induced anesthesia are not fully elucidated. Two-channel EEG data from seven volunteers who had undergone a brief standardized propofol anesthesia were then adopted to calculate eight synchronization indexes. We computed the prediction probability (P K ) of synchronization indexes with Bispectral Index (BIS) and propofol effect-site concentration (C eff ) to quantify the ability of the indexes to predict BIS and C eff . Also, box plots and coefficient of variation were used to reflect the different synchronization changes and their robustness to noise in awake, unconscious and recovery states, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was used for assessing the relationship among synchronization measures, BIS and C eff . Permutation cross mutual information (PCMI) and determinism (DET) could predict BIS and follow C eff better than nonlinear interdependence (NI), mutual information based on kernel estimation (KerMI) and cross correlation. Wavelet transform coherence (WTC) in α and β frequency bands followed BIS and C eff better than that in other frequency bands. There was a significant decrease in unconscious state and a significant increase in recovery state for PCMI and NI, while the trends were opposite for KerMI, DET and WTC. Phase synchronization based on phase locking value (PSPLV) in δ, θ, α and γ1 frequency bands dropped significantly in unconscious state, whereas it had no significant synchronization in recovery state. Moreover, PCMI, NI, DET correlated closely with each other and they had a better robustness to noise and higher correlation with BIS and C eff than other synchronization indexes. Propofol caused EEG synchronization changes during the anesthetic period. Different synchronization measures had individual properties in evaluating synchronization changes in different anesthetic states, which might be related to various forms of neural activities and neurophysiological mechanisms under general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26350675/

This report is a secondary analysis of data from a prospective, controlled interventional study comparing the effect of sevoflurane administration guided by BIS monitoring (group SevoBIS) and constant administration of sevoflurane (group Sevo1.8Vol%) during CPB. Sevoflurane plasma concentration (SPC) was measured using gas chromatography. The relationships of BIS to SPC, CPB pump flow, arterial pressure, hematocrit, temperature, time on CPB, and patient characteristics were analysed.
No association was observed between BIS values and SPC in group SevoBIS. In group Sevo1.8Vol%, a 40 μg ml-1 increase in SPC, which encompassed the entire range of observed values of the SPC in this analysis, was associated with a decrease of 3.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-6.1) in BIS values (p = 0.005). Each increase in CPB time of 10 minutes was associated with an increase in BIS values of 0.25 (95%CI: 0.11-0.39, p<0.001). Path analysis revealed that the BIS values of SevoBIS patients were 5.3 (95%CI: 3.2-7.5) units higher than those of Sevo1.8Vol% patients (p<0.001), which was the strongest effect on BIS values.

Precise registration is indispensable for the accuracy of navigation. The rapid and precise registration by surface matching on the facial skin is possible using the landmarks of the face in the supine position. On the other hand, incomplete registration often occurs in the lateral or prone position due to the direction of the face and displacement of the skin by headpins and obscuring of the skin by the bispectral index monitor and many electrodes on the forehead as well as the eye patch. Surface matching on the occipital scalp is not suitable for registration because the shape of the occipital scalp is flat and it is compressed in the supine position when obtaining preoperative neuroimaging. To overcome this problem, the authors have developed a new method of registration designated as ""bony surface registration"" in which surface matching is achieved using the bony surface of the skull after exposure.
Between June and December 2014, this technique was used in 23 patients and its effectiveness was examined.
Registration time was markedly shortened and useful navigation was achieved due to accurate registration in all patients.

In this prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled study a total of 100 super obese patients (body mass index, BMI > 50 kg/m2) undergoing bariatric surgery were randomly allocated in four groups: a sevoflurane group (n = 25), a sevoflurane with BIS monitoring group (n = 25), a propofol group (n=25) and a propofol with BIS monitoring group (n=25). Hemodynamic parameters, depth of anesthesia, recovery from anesthesia and postoperative pain were recorded.
The mean age of patients was 37.7 ± 9.2 years and the median BMI was 57.86 ± 9.33. There were no statistically significant differences between the four groups with respect to patient characteristics, comorbidities and duration of surgery. The intraoperatively mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in both propofol groups. No significant difference was observed between the four groups in respect to heart rate changes during anesthesia. Although the time to eye-opening and extubation was significantly shorter in both propofol groups, recovery from anesthesia, assessed with the Aldrete, Chung and White recovery scores, was significantly faster in sevoflurane groups. No significant difference was observed in postoperative pain between the four groups.

Although observation of pain behaviors (e.g., frowning) is recommended for pain assessment in nonverbal populations, they are attenuated and sometimes even suppressed in patients with TBI receiving high doses of sedatives. This study explored the potential utility of the bilateral bispectral index system (BIS) for pain detection in critically ill adults with TBI and altered level of consciousness.
Using a repeated measure within-subject design, participants (N = 25) were observed for 1 minute before (baseline), during, and 15 minutes after two procedures: (a) noninvasive blood pressure (nonnociceptive) and (b) turning (nociceptive). At each assessment, BIS indexes (0-100) of the right (R) and left (L) hemispheres and pain behaviors were documented.
Compared with baseline, significant median increases (p ≤ .05) in BIS-R (+4.93%) and BIS-L (+8.43%) and in the frequency of pain behaviors (+3.00) were observed during turning but not noninvasive blood pressure. Interestingly, increases in BIS-R were more pronounced in participants with left-sided TBI (+17.23%, p = .021) than those with right-sided TBI (+3.01%). BIS-R fluctuations in participants with left-sided TBI were also positively correlated (r(s) = .986, p ≤ .001) with the frequency of pain behaviors observed during turning.
Overall, only increases in BIS-R were correlated with participants' pain behaviors and in those with left-sided TBI exclusively.

In a blinded clinical trial, 92 patients scheduled for supratentorial craniotomy under general anaesthesia were randomly allocated into either a multipoint TEAS (n=46) or a sham TEAS group (n=46). All patients received total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and sufentanil. The target concentration of sufentanil was adjusted and recorded according to mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and bispectral index (BIS). Patients in the TEAS group received TEAS 30 min before anaesthesia induction and this was maintained throughout the operation at four pairs of acupuncture points. Postoperative pain, recovery and side effects were evaluated.
Eighty-eight patients completed the study. Continuous monitoring of MAP, HR and BIS showed stable values with no significant differences between the two groups (p>0.05). Sufentanil target plasma concentration in TEAS patients was significantly lower at some time points during supratentorial craniotomy, and total sufentanil consumption was significantly higher in the sham group (p<0.05). Postoperative recovery and pain were significantly improved by TEAS (p<0.001), without the postoperative side effects.
Multipoint TEAS at both proximal and distal points combined with TIVA can significantly decrease intraoperative sufentanil requirements, increase pain relief on postoperative day 1 and improve postoperative recovery of patients during supratentorial tumour resection, with no significant increase of side effects. These findings suggest that multipoint TEAS may be clinically effective as an adjunct to analgesia in intraoperative anaesthesia and postoperative pain treatment and may speed recovery.

The monitors of depth of anesthesia, based on the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), have been progressively introduced into the daily practice to provide additional information about the state of the patient. However, the quantification of analgesia still remains an open problem. The purpose of this work is to improve the prediction of nociceptive responses with linear and non-linear measures calculated from EEG signal filtered in frequency bands higher than the traditional bands. Power spectral density and auto-mutual information function was applied in order to predict the presence or absence of the nociceptive responses to different stimuli during sedation in endoscopy procedure. The proposed measures exhibit better performances than the bispectral index (BIS). Values of prediction probability of Pk above 0.75 and percentages of sensitivity and specificity above 70% were achieved combining EEG measures from the traditional frequency bands and higher frequency bands.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25901571/

It is widely used in China for such complex operations as brain, heart, and abdominal surgery. It is popular in China because it is economical, practical, and beneficial to the patients. With acupuncture anesthesia there is less bleeding during surgery and there is also quicker post-operative recovery.
This randomized prospective study aims at comparing the effect of two acupoints (Yongquan, KI1 and Renzhong, DU26) with sham acupuncture and no acupuncture on the time to recovery of consciousness after general anesthesia by means of the Bispectral Index monitor (BIS).
This is a prospective randomized controlled study. We randomly assigned 50 patients to 5 groups during recovery from surgical anesthesia. Four groups had acupuncture on KI1 (group A), DU26 (groups B), both KI1 and DU26 (group C), and sham points (group D), and one had no acupuncture (group E).
Bispectral Index (BIS), time to spontaneous eye opening, time to tracheal extubation, and time to following commands were measured as the main outcome measures.
Time to spontaneous eye opening differed among groups (P=0.002), as well as time to tracheal extubation (P<0.000 1) and time to following commands (P=0.000 6). BIS values differed significantly among groups both 5 and 10 min after the end of anesthesia (P<0.000 1 and P=0.000 4, respectively). BIS values of groups D and E were lower than those of the other groups and those of group C were higher. The same pattern was observed also 15 and 30 min after the end of anesthesia, although the difference among groups was not significant at these time points (P=0.164 and P=0.104, respectively).
Acupuncture on DU26 and KI1 accelerates recovery of consciousness after general anesthesia. Moreover, a possible synergistic effect of DU26 and KI1 is suggested. This issue may play a role in the optimization of operating room management and raise interest about the usefulness of acupuncture on unconsciousness states of different nature.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25797640/

Therefore, an accurate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for propofol is required to tailor depth of anaesthesia.
To compare the predictive performances of the Marsh and the Schnider PK/PD models during awake craniotomy.
A prospective observational study.
Single university hospital from February 2009 to May 2010.
Twelve patients undergoing elective awake craniotomy for resection of brain tumour or epileptogenic areas.
Arterial blood samples were drawn at intervals and the propofol plasma concentration was determined.
The prediction error, bias [median prediction error (MDPE)] and inaccuracy [median absolute prediction error (MDAPE)] of the Marsh and the Schnider models were calculated. The secondary endpoint was the prediction probability PK, by which changes in the propofol effect-site concentration (as derived from simultaneous PK/PD modelling) predicted changes in anaesthetic depth (measured by the bispectral index).
The Marsh model was associated with a significantly (P = 0.05) higher inaccuracy (MDAPE 28.9 ± 12.0%) than the Schnider model (MDAPE 21.5 ± 7.7%) and tended to reach a higher bias (MDPE Marsh -11.7 ± 14.3%, MDPE Schnider -5.4 ± 20.7%, P = 0.09). MDAPE was outside of accepted limits in six (Marsh model) and two (Schnider model) of 12 patients. The prediction probability was comparable between the Marsh (PK 0.798 ± 0.056) and the Schnider model (PK 0.787 ± 0.055), but after adjusting the models to each individual patient, the Schnider model achieved significantly higher prediction probabilities (PK 0.807 ± 0.056, P = 0.05).
When using the 'asleep-awake-asleep' anaesthetic technique during awake craniotomy, we advocate using the PK/PD model proposed by Schnider. Due to considerable interindividual variation, additional monitoring of anaesthetic depth is recommended.

During the positioning, we observed an increased suppression ratio (SR) while BIS and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) were at adequate level. In view of the difference in blood pressure between the heart and the base of the brain, blood pressure was maintained to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion. Although intraoperative rSO2 was at or around the cut-off point (a 12% relative decrease from baseline), no marked decrease in BIS or further increase in the SR was observed.

This study seeks to answer the question: ""To what degree can EEG suppression and burst count as measured by diagnostic EEG during drug-induced coma be predicted from data obtained from the BIS such as BIS value, suppression ratio (SR), and burst count?""
During drug-induced coma, cortical EEG is the gold standard for real-time monitoring and drug titration. Diagnostic EEG is, from setup through data analysis, labor intensive, costly, and difficult to maintain uniform clinician competency. BIS monitoring is less expensive, less labor-intensive, and easier to interpret data and establish/maintain competency. Validating BIS data versus diagnostic EEG facilitates effective brain monitoring during drug-induced coma at lower cost with similar outcomes.
This is a prospective, observational cohort study. Four consecutive patients receiving drug-induced coma/EEG monitoring were enrolled. BIS was initiated after informed consent. Variables recorded per minute included presence or absence of EEG burst suppression, burst count, BIS value over time, burst count, and SR. Pearson's product-moment and Spearman rank coefficient for BIS value and SR versus burst count were performed. Regression analysis was utilized to plot BIS values versus bursts/minute on EEG as well as SR versus burst count on EEG. EEG/BIS data were collected from digital data files and transcribed onto data sheets for corresponding time indices.
Four patients yielded 1,972 data sets over 33 hours of EEG/BIS monitoring. Regression coefficient of 0.6673 shows robust predictive value between EEG burst count and BIS SR. Spearman rank coefficient of -0.8727 indicates strong inverse correlation between EEG burst count and BIS SR. Pearson's correlation coefficient between EEG versus BIS burst count was .8256 indicating strong positive correlation. Spearman's rank coefficient of 0.8810 and Pearson's correlation coefficient of .6819 showed strong correlation between BIS value versus EEG burst count. Number of patients (4) limits available statistics and ability to generalize results. Graphs and statistics show strong correlation/predictive value for BIS parameters to EEG suppression.
This study is the first to measure correlation and predictive value between BIS monitoring and diagnostic EEG for degree of EEG suppression and burst count in the adult population. Available statistic tests and graphing of variables from BIS and diagnostic EEG show strong correlation and predictive value between both monitoring technologies during drug-induced coma. These support using BIS value, SR, and burst count to predict degree of EEG suppression in real time for titrating metabolic suppression therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25629593/

A total of 40 consecutive patients (20 per group) undergoing brainstem surgery were randomly assigned to 2 groups receiving either 0.5 MAC sevoflurane or propofol at an effect-site concentration of 2.5 µg/mL for maintenance of anesthesia. Remifentanil was administered to both groups at a rate of 0.25 to 0.35 μg/kg/min along with cisatracurium (0.03 to 0.04 mg/kg/h). TceMEP recordings were carried out in the abductor pollicis brevis, abductor hallucis, and tibialis anterior muscles, whereas cortical SSEPs were measured with posterior tibial nerve stimulation. Amplitudes and latencies of TceMEPs and SSEPs were recorded at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the induction of anesthesia.
BIS values remained in the 45 to 60 range. Amplitudes of TceMEPs were significantly higher in the propofol group than those in the sevoflurane group (P<0.05, at all study time points in abductor pollicis brevis and abductor hallucis muscles and only 4 h after anesthetic induction for tibialis anterior muscle), whereas latencies were shorter in the propofol group than those in the sevoflurane group (P<0.05). No differences were observed in latency and amplitude while recording SSEPs between the 2 anesthetic techniques. None of the patients had TceMEPs and SSEPs amplitude or latency changes, exceeding our set limit.

Prediction probability (PK) of state entropy to discriminate consciousness from unconsciousness. Correlation and agreement between state entropy and BIS from deep to light hypnosis. Analysis of raw EEG compared with index values that are in conflict with clinical examination, with frequency measures (frequency bands/Spectral Edge Frequency 95) and visual inspection for physiological EEG patterns (e.g. beta or delta arousal), pathophysiological features such as high-frequency signals (electromyogram/high-frequency EEG or eye fluttering/saccades), different types of electro-oculogram or epileptiform EEG and technical artefacts.
PK of state entropy was 0.80 and of BIS 0.84; correlation coefficient of state entropy with BIS 0.78. Nine percent BIS and 14% state entropy values disagreed with clinical examination. Highest incidence of disagreement occurred after state transitions, in particular for state entropy after loss of consciousness during sevoflurane anaesthesia. EEG sequences which led to false 'conscious' index values often showed high-frequency signals and eye blinks. High-frequency EEG/electromyogram signals were pooled because a separation into EEG and fast electro-oculogram, for example eye fluttering or saccades, on the basis of a single EEG channel may not be very reliable. These signals led to higher Spectral Edge Frequency 95 and ratio of relative beta and gamma band power than EEG signals, indicating adequate unconscious classification. The frequency of other artefacts that were assignable, for example technical artefacts, movement artefacts, was negligible and they were excluded from analysis.
High-frequency signals and eye blinks may account for index values that falsely indicate consciousness. Compared with BIS, state entropy showed more false classifications of the clinical state at transition between consciousness and unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25564779/

However, pharmacodynamic variability can cause problems with maintaining the adequate level of anaesthesia. The bispectral index (BIS) is one of only a few parameters that allow an assessment of the depth of anaesthesia. In the present study, we attempted to determine the optimal dosages of drugs used for total intravenous anaesthesia with TCI based on BIS-guided monitoring of depth of anaesthesia.
The study was conducted in 60 ASA I patients undergoing elective surgery due to lumbar discopathy. The participants were divided into two groups of 30 individuals. The patients were premedicated with 15 mg oral midazolam. Group I was the control group; group II received BIS monitoring.

Monitoring depth of anesthesia is a fundamental solution to this problem. The induction of anesthesia alters frequency and mean of amplitudes of the electroencephalogram (EEG), and its phase couplings. We analyzed EEG changes for phase coupling between delta and alpha subbands using a new algorithm for depth of general anesthesia measurement based on complex wavelet transform (CWT) in patients anesthetized by Propofol. Entropy and histogram of modulated signals were calculated by taking bispectral index (BIS) values as reference. Entropies corresponding to different BIS intervals using Mann-Whitney U test showed that they had different continuous distributions. The results demonstrated that there is a phase coupling between 3 and 4 Hz in delta and 8-9 Hz in alpha subbands and these changes are shown better at the channel T 7 of EEG. Moreover, when BIS values increase, the entropy value of modulated signal also increases and vice versa. In addition, measuring phase coupling between delta and alpha subbands of EEG signals through continuous CWT analysis reveals the depth of anesthesia level. As a result, awareness during anesthesia can be prevented.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25276220/

Intraoperative anesthetic depth may impact recovery, but the impact of brain monitoring on time to extubation and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay after cardiac surgery has not been extensively studied. Our goal was to determine if BIS-guided anesthesia improves time to extubation compared to MAC-guided anesthesia in a cardiac surgery population.
In this secondary outcome analysis of a randomized controlled study, we analyzed 294 patients undergoing elective coronary bypass grafting, valve replacements, and bypass plus valve replacements at a single tertiary referral center between February 1, 2009 and April 30, 2010. We analyzed cardiac surgery patients that had been randomized to BIS-guided anesthesia alerts (n = 131) or MAC-guided anesthesia alerts (n = 163). The primary outcome measure was time to extubation in the BIS-guided and anesthetic concentration-guided groups. Secondary outcomes were length of stay in the ICU and total postoperative hospital length of stay.
Valid extubation time data were available for 247 of 294 patients. The median [IQR] time to extubation was 307 [215 to 771] minutes in the BIS group and 323 [196 to 730] minutes in the anesthetic concentration group (p = 0.61). The median [IQR] ICU length of stay was 54 [29 to 97] hours versus 70 [44 to 99] hours (p = 0.11). In terms of postoperative hospital length of stay, there was no difference between the groups with median [IQR] times of 6 [5-8] days (p = 0.69) in each group.
The use of intraoperative BIS monitoring during cardiac surgery did not change time to extubation, ICU length of stay or hospital length of stay. Data regarding BIS monitoring and recovery in an exclusively cardiac surgery population are consistent with recent effectiveness studies in the general surgical population.

We used order patterns cross recurrence plot and provide an index named order pattern laminarity (OPL) to assess changes in neuronal synchronization as the mechanism forming the foundation of conscious perception. The prediction probability of 0.9 and 0.84 for OPL and BIS specified that the OPL index correlated more strongly with effect-site propofol concentration. Also, our new index makes faster reaction to transients in EEG recordings based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model parameters and demonstrates less variability at the point of loss of consciousness (standard deviation of 0.04 for OPL compared with 0.09 for BIS index).

Provision of neuroprotection during temporary clipping may improve postoperative cognition in such patients.
Good-grade aneurysmal SAH patients undergoing temporary clipping during surgery were allocated either to group C (control) or group P (propofol). Patients in group P received propofol in titrated doses to attain a burst suppression ratio of 75 ± 5% on bispectral index (BIS) monitor. The cognitive function as assessed by Hindi-language modification of mini-mental state examination (HMSE) score was evaluated preoperatively, 24 h after surgery, and at discharge from hospital. A score of ≤23 was indicative of cognitive dysfunction. Perioperative complications, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, and outcome at discharge were noted.
A total of 66 patients (32 and 34 in group C and P respectively) were included in the study. 97% of the patients had anterior circulation aneurysms. At 24 h after surgery, eight and 12 patients in group C and P respectively; and at discharge, five patients in each group had cognitive dysfunction. In both groups, the trend showed a decline in cognition at 24 h followed by improvement at discharge. Glasgow outcome score in both the groups was comparable (P > 0.05). Intraoperative brain bulge, postoperative vasospasm, and cerebral infarction were found to be independent risk factors for cognitive dysfunction.
Pharmacologic neuroprotection with propofol at the time of temporary clipping during surgery for aneurysmal SAH did not offer any advantage as far as preservation of cognition is concerned.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25033847/

Ideally, the incorporation of brain monitoring into routine practice would promote the maintenance of an optimal depth of anaesthesia, with an ultimate goal of avoiding the negative outcomes that have been associated with inadequate or excessive anaesthesia. A variety of processed electroencephalogram devices exist, of which the bispectral index is the most widely used, particularly in the research setting. Whether such devices prove to be useful will depend not only on their ability to influence anaesthetic management but also on whether the changes they promote can actually affect clinically important outcomes. This review highlights the evidence for the role of bispectral index monitoring, in particular, in guiding anaesthetic management and influencing clinical outcomes, specifically intra-operative awareness, measures of early recovery, mortality and neurocognitive outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24905798/

However no data on this subject has been reported for Thai ICUs. The objective of the present study is to describe the non-CPM situation in Thai ICUs.
ICU RESOURCE I survey database released during the year 2012 was used for the present study. Non-CPMo refers to neurological monitoring, renal function monitoring, metabolic monitoring, perfusion monitoring and identifying biomarkers. Academic hospital (ACAD), availability grading (AG), numeric frequency grading scale (FGS) and device availability per bed (DPB) were used for categorization of non-CPM collected data. Significant differences between the groups are defined as p < 0.05.
Advanced monitoring, including; indirect calorimetry, near infrared spectroscopy, peripheral nerve stimulation, gut mucosal tonometry and sublingual side stream darkfield imaging are currently unavailable in participating Thai ICUs. All ICUs have devices to measure the levels of capillary glucose, creatinine kinase MB, troponin T and albumin. Bispectral index, ultrasound, continuous renal replacement therapy devices, continuous enteral feeding pumps, intra-abdominal pressure monitoring devices and rectal temperature measuring devices are available in ACAD facilities in greater instances than in other institutions. Similarly; for biomarker and drug level monitoring; procalcitonin, interleukin, brain natriuretic peptide, total creatinine kinase, neutrophilgelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), lactate, central venous oxygen saturation/mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2/SvO2), phenytoin, vancomycin and pre-albumin are used more frequently in ACADs. Gap analysis demonstrating warmer cabins, NGAL, lactate and ScvO2/SvO2 show less availability but are frequently used when they have been made available. Intra-abdominal pressure and core temperatures are used less in general ICU practices and are scarcely found.
Some of the more advanced non-CPM devices are not found in Thai ICUs. Basic non-CPM devices are available in all ICUs. Some new devices for measurements and for biomarkers are used with greater prevalence in ACAD ICUs.

We evaluated the performance of a triage model based on early bispectral index (BIS) findings and cardiac risk classes.
Retrospective evaluation of serial patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, unable to follow commands, and undergoing hypothermia. Patients were assigned to a cardiac risk group: STEMI, VT/VF shock, VT/VF no shock, or PEA/asystole, and to a neurological dysfunction group, based on the BIS score following first neuromuscular blockade (BISi), and classified as BISi>20, BISi 10-20, or BISi<10. Cause of death was described as neurological or circulatory.
BISi in 171 patients was measured at 267(±177)min after resuscitation and 35(±1.7)°C. BISi<10 suffered 82% neurological-cause and 91% overall mortality, BISi 10-20 35% neurological and 55% overall mortality, and BISi>20 12% neurological and 36% overall mortality. 33 patients presented with STEMI, 15 VT/VF-shock, 41 VT/VF-no shock, and 80 PEA/asystole. Among BISi>20 patients, 75% with STEMI underwent urgent cardiac catheterization (cath) and 94% had good outcome. When BISi>20 with VT/VF and shock, urgent cath was infrequent (33%), and 4 deaths (44%) were uniformly of circulatory etiology. Of 56 VT/VF patients without STEMI, 24 were BISi>20 but did not undergo urgent cath - 5(20.8%) of these had circulatory-etiology death. Circulatory-etiology death also occurred in 26.5% BIS>20 patients with PEA/asystole. When BISi<10, a neurological etiology death dominated independent of cardiac risk group.

Today, electroencephalogram-based monitors promise a more specific assessment of the brain function. To date, most approaches were focused on a ""head-to-head"" comparison of either electroencephalogram- or standard parameter-based monitoring. In the current study, a multimodal indicator based on a combination of both electro encephalographic and standard anesthesia monitoring parameters is defined for quantification of ""anesthesia depth.""
Two hundred sixty-three adult patients from six European centers undergoing surgery with general anesthesia were assigned to 1 of 10 anesthetic combinations according to standards of the enrolling hospital. The anesthesia multimodal index of consciousness was developed using a data-driven approach, which maps standard monitoring and electroencephalographic parameters into an output indicator that separates different levels of anesthesia from awake to electroencephalographic burst suppression. Obtained results were compared with either a combination of standard monitoring parameters or the electroencephalogram-based bispectral index.
The anesthesia multimodal index of consciousness showed prediction probability (P(K)) of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.97) to separate different levels of anesthesia (wakefulness to burst suppression), whereas the bispectral index had significantly lower PK of 0.80 (0.76 to 0.81) at corrected threshold P value of less than 0.05. At the transition between consciousness and unconsciousness, anesthesia multimodal index of consciousness yielded a PK of 0.88 (0.85 to 0.91).

The cortical activity monitoring in stroke patients is usually performed to evaluate epileptic activity through electroencephalogram. Bispectral index (BIS) monitor the cortical activity by fronto-temporal electrodes and is currently used for monitoring level of conscious on sedo-analgesia patients. Some studies have shown certain sensibility to detect cerebrovascular events during carotid revascularization. We aimed to evaluate the impact of BIS monitoring before and shortly after reperfusion on early and delayed clinical improvement on stroke patients.
Consecutive patients with acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke who received reperfusion therapies were monitored with bicortical BIS during the first 6 hours of admission. We registered initial and final BIS value on the affected and contralateral side and determined asymmetry and changes in relation to recanalization and other clinical variables as sedation and perprocedure complications. We defined major clinical improvement decrease ≥ 8 points at discharge or 5 day at admission. Infarct volume was measure on 24-hour CT scan. Modified Rankin score at 3 months was evaluated.
A total of 53 patients were monitored with BIS. Median age was 73 years, median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 16. We observed an inverse correlation between final BIS score and NIHSS at discharge (P < .001; r = -.538) and infarct volume at 24 hours (P = .031; r = -.430). A receiver-operator characteristic curve identified a final BIS score of >81 as the value that better predicted further clinical improvement. After adjusting for recanalization, posttreatment NIHSS and age, final BIS emerged as the only independent predictor of clinical improvement(OR 1.21; CI 95%:1.01-1.28; P = .024).

Prospective, randomized, controlled study.
Fifty-four patients aged between 18 and 65 years who underwent elective minor surgery (tumorectomy for breast cancer or inguinal hernia repair) were randomly assigned to receive sevoflurane or propofol anaesthesia. Exclusion criteria included pre-existing cerebrovascular diseases, anaemia, ASA >III, blood loss ≥200 mL, arterial hypotension, baseline pulse oximetry <97%, sign of sensor low quality of SrO2 or bispectral index, and patients with a forehead area <6.5cm. SrO2, bispectral index, haemodynamic data and anaesthetic doses were recorded during surgery.
A total of 48 patients were included in the final analysis (24 in each group). There were no significant differences in mean, minimum and maximum SrO2 between sevoflurane and propofol groups. The relative maximum decrease was higher in propofol anaesthesia than sevoflurane anaesthesia (9.6±10.7 versus 4.2±7.2%; P=0.048). Cerebral desaturation (20% reduction from SrO2 baseline during 15 seconds) occurred in 4 patients in propofol group exclusively (P=0.109). SrO2 adjusted for baseline was higher in the sevoflurane group than in the propofol group (67.3±1.8% versus 64.2±1.7%; P=0.018). There were no significant differences in haemodynamic parameters between the two groups.
Cerebral cortical oxygenation measured by NIRS may be better preserved with sevoflurane than with propofol.

In this single-center substudy of the BAG-RECALL trial (NCT00682825), we screened patients after cardiac or thoracic surgery in the ICU twice daily for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium in patients who had been randomized to intraoperative Bispectral Index (BIS)-guided and end-tidal anesthetic concentration-guided depth of anesthesia protocols. As a secondary analysis, a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection strategy was used to rank a field of candidate risk factors for delirium, followed by binary logistic regression.
Of 310 patients assessed, 28 of 149 (18.8%) in the BIS group and 45 of 161 (28.0%) in the end-tidal anesthetic concentration group developed postoperative delirium in the ICU (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval, 0.35-1.02, P= 0.058). Low average volatile anesthetic dose, intraoperative transfusion, ASA physical status, and European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation were identified as independent predictors of delirium.
A larger randomized study should determine whether brain monitoring with BIS or an alternative method decreases delirium after cardiac or thoracic surgery. The association between low anesthetic concentration and delirium is a surprising finding and could reflect that patients with poor health are both more sensitive to the effects of volatile anesthetic drugs and are also more likely to develop postoperative delirium. Investigation of candidate methods to prevent delirium should be prioritized in view of the established association between postoperative delirium and adverse patient outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24413548/

In particular, variation of R-R peak interval (RRI) of electrocardiography appears regularly oscillatory in deeper levels of anaesthesia and less regular in lighter levels of anaesthesia. We proposed a new index, non-rhythmic-to-rhythmic ratio (NRR), to quantify this feature and investigated its potential to estimate depth of anaesthesia.
Thirty-one female patients were enrolled in this prospective study. The oscillatory pattern transition of RRI was visualised by the time-varying power spectrum and quantified by NRR. The prediction of anaesthetic events, including skin incision, first reaction of motor movement during emergence period, loss of consciousness (LOC) and return of consciousness (ROC) by NRR were evaluated by serial prediction probability (PK ) analysis; the ability to predict the decrease of effect-site sevoflurane concentration was also evaluated. The results were compared with Bispectral Index (BIS).
NRR well-predicted first reaction (PK  > 0.90) 30 s ahead, earlier than BIS and significantly better than HRV indices. NRR well-correlated with sevoflurane concentration, although its correlation was inferior to BIS, while HRV indices had no such correlation. BIS indicated LOC and ROC best.

We tested the hypothesis whether monitoring of bispectral index (BIS) and suppression ratio (SR) could serve as an early prognostic indicator of neurological outcomes after CPR.
Cerebral monitoring (BIS, SR) was started as soon as possible after initiation of CPR and was continued for up to 72h. The functional neurological outcome was measured on day 3, day 7 and again one month after CPR via a clinical examination and assessment according to the cerebral performance category score (CPC).
In total 79 patients were included. Of these, 26 patients (32.9%) survived the observation period of one month; 7 of them (8.9%) showed an unfavourable neurological outcome. These 7 patients had significantly lower median BIS values (25 [21;37] vs. 61 [51;70]) and higher SR (56 [44;64] vs. 7 [1;22]) during the first 4h after the initiation of CPR.

The odds ratio for predicting an unfavourable neurological outcome was 0.921 (95% CI 0.853-0.985). The likelihood to remain in a poor neurological condition decreased by 7.9% for each additional point of BIS, on average.

Thirty patients who underwent tonsillectomy under general anesthesia (GA) were included. Patients were assigned randomly to one of two groups: group 1 (n = 15) received propofol, group 2 (n = 15) sevoflurane as anesthetic agent. The sedation level was assessed by the bispectral index system. DPOAE measurements were performed before premedication (T 1), 5 min after premedication (T 2), 3 min after induction of general anesthesia (T 3) and every 10 min (T 4, T 5) thereafter until the end of surgery at about 23 min post-anesthetic induction, while sedation levels were obtained starting at the beginning until the end of anesthesia. After premedication, both blood oxygen saturation and heart rate decreased. Following induction of anesthesia systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased, while, as expected, the level of sedation increased. Analyzing the propofol and sevoflurane group separately, both groups showed comparable overall courses of DPOAE levels at higher frequencies (2.8 kHz p = 0.310, 4 kHz p = 0.193, 6 kHz p = 0.269, 8 kHz p = 0.223) and no changes of DPOAE levels compared with baseline values were observed. At T5 the 1 kHz DPOAE level increased in the propofol group and slightly decreased in the sevoflurane group (p < 0.001). While the 1.4 kHz DPOAE level in the propofol group did not change over time the 1.4 kHz DPOAE level decreased in the sevoflurane group (baseline to T 4 p = 0.045; Baseline to T 5 p = 0.004). While overall there were different courses between these two groups in the 2 kHz DPOAE level, in the post hoc analysis only a tendency in the change from baseline to T 4 could be observed (p = 0.082). These results indicate that while the amplitudes of certain DPOAEs were influenced by GA, the depth of anesthesia had no effect on this measure of cochlear function in clinical routine. Therefore, DPOAE measurements in sedation and during GA are useful but the effect of anesthetic agents on DPOAE levels needs to be taken into account when analyzing the test.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24150547/

Near-infrared spectroscopy has been described as a non-invasive, continuous method to monitor cerebral oxygen saturation. However, its impact on neurobehavioral outcome comparing different anesthesia regimens has been poorly described.
In this prospective, assessor-blinded study, 90 patients undergoing shoulder surgery in beach chair position following general (G-group, n=45) or regional anesthesia (R-group; n=45) were enrolled to assess the prevalence of cerebral desaturation events comparing anesthesia regimens and their impact on neurobehavioral and neurological outcome. Anesthesiologists were blinded to regional cerebral oxygen saturation values. Baseline data assessed the day before surgery included neurological and neurobehavioral tests, which were repeated the day after surgery. The baseline data for regional cerebral oxygen saturation/bispectral index and invasive blood pressure both at heart and auditory meatus levels were taken prior to anesthesia, 5 min after induction of anesthesia, 5 min after beach chair positioning, after skin incision and thereafter all 20 min until discharge.
Patients in the R-group showed significantly less cerebral desaturation events (p<0.001), drops in regional cerebral oxygen saturation values (p<0.001), significantly better neurobehavioral test results the day after surgery (p<0.001) and showed a greater hemodynamic stability in the beach chair position compared to patients in the G-group.
The incidence of regional cerebral oxygen desaturations seems to influence the neurobehavioral outcome. Regional anesthesia offers more stable cardiovascular conditions for shoulder surgery in beach chair position influencing neurobehavioral test results at 24h.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24119783/

Clinical anaesthesiology,2013,"Ellerkmann RK, Soehle M, Kreuer S","To easily measure the depth of anaesthesia during routine surgical procedures has always been a goal in anaesthesiology. For decades, scientists have been developing indices to describe and evaluate the depth of anaesthesia. Historically, mean alveolar gas concentration (MAC) values for volatile anaesthetics have been used to target a predefined level of anaesthesia. MAC values were however not established to differentiate between the hypnotic and analgesic components of anaesthesia. Indices were therefore developed that measure the effect of hypnotics predominantly on the brain (in contrast to an effect on the spinal cord) with the vision to be able to measure the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness. Although monitors measuring the depth of anaesthesia are still not capable of measuring the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness, brain monitoring has proved to help clinicians control the depth of anaesthesia. Clinical trials have shown that the use of brain-monitoring devices can lead to a reduction of intraoperative drug consumption, reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, facilitate recovery from anaesthesia compared to routine care and can also lead to a reduction of intraoperative awareness. However a study demonstrating both a reduced intraoperative drug consumption and at the same time a reduction of intraoperative awareness due to the use of brain-monitoring devices has not been published yet.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24012234/

In total, 90 coma patients with severe brain injuries underwent BIS monitoring, and serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100 protein levels were assayed within the first 3 days of admission. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the performance of BIS values for predicting death within 2 weeks. A cutoff value was calculated using the Youden index.
A significant negative correlation was found between BIS value and serum NSE and S100 levels. The area under the curve for BIS value was 0.841 (p < 0.001, 95 % CI = 0.751-0.931), and higher than for NSE (0.713) (p = 0.002, 95 % CI = 0.582-0.844) or S100 (0.790) (p < 0.001, 95 % CI = 0.680-0.899). The optimal cutoff of BIS was 32.5. Serum NSE and S100 protein levels and the mortality rate were significantly lower in patients with a BIS value >32.5 than in patients with a BIS value ≤32.5.
Bispectral index values may reflect degree of brain injury, and BIS is an objective and noninvasive monitoring method for helping clinicians to predict death in patients with a BIS value ≤32.5.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23934324/

Such surgeries offer great benefits to the patient due to faster reconvalescence and less pain as well as faster return to normal life. The HAL-RAR method for haemorrhoid surgery, introduced as early as in 1995 by Dr. Morigan in Japan.
The goal of our study including 137 patients was research of effects of the spinal and general anaesthesia while monitoring the Bispectral Index (BIS) during the surgery. We focused mainly on the need of postoperative analgesia and possibility to discharge patient to home care after the surgery with the above mentioned type of anaesthesia. BIS helped us to monitor the sufficiency of anaesthesia and anaesthetics dosage regulation that was reflected in earlier awakening and faster reconvalescence, as well as saving anaesthetics.
The length of surgery was not affected by the particular type of anaesthetic procedures (25.7 minutes for the general anaesthesia and 30.2 minutes for the spinal anaesthesia). The need for postoperative analgesia was necessary for the period of 240.0 minutes after the completion of surgery for the general anaesthesia and 313.0 minutes for the spinal anaesthesia after the administration of anaesthetics intrathecally.
BIS is a processed EEG parameter measuring the hypnotic effect of hypnotics and sedatives in brain. BIS helps to reduce the use of anaesthetics during anaesthesia. Our results are promising and we continue in the study, monitoring also other possible parameters.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23685420/

Accurate methods to predict outcome after CA are lacking.
Seventy-five patients with CA treated with therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac resuscitation were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and neuron-enriched S100 beta (S100β) were measured 48 h after CA. Bispectral index (BIS) was continuously monitored during the first 48 h after CA. The primary endpoint was neurological outcome, as defined by the cerebral performance category (CPC) at 6-month follow-up: scores 1 or 2 indicated good outcome, and scores 3 to 5, poor outcome. The secondary endpoint was survival.
A total of 46 (61%) patients survived at 6 months and 41 (55%) patients had CPC 1 or 2. Levels of NSE and S100β were higher in patients with poor outcomes compared with patients with good outcomes (4-fold and 10-fold, respectively; p < 0.001). BIS was lower in patients with poor outcomes (10-fold; p < 0.001). NSE, S100β, or BIS alone predicted neurological outcome, with areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) above 0.80. Combined determination of S100β and BIS had an incremental predictive value (AUC: 0.95). S100β improved discriminations based on BIS (p = 0.0008), and BIS improved discriminations based on S100β (p < 10(-5)). Patients with S100β level above 0.03 μg/l and BIS below 5.5 had a 3.6-fold higher risk of poor neurological outcome (p < 0.0001).

Whether or not the balance between cerebral oxygen supply and demand is maintained lacks adequate elucidation. It is thus intriguing to explore how cerebral tissue oxygen saturation is affected by anaesthetic-induced hypotension. Thirty-three patients scheduled for elective non-neurosurgical procedures were included in this study. Physiological measurements were performed immediately before induction with propofol and fentanyl and after tracheal intubation. Mean (SD) Bispectral index decreased from 84.3 (9.3) to 24.4 (8.0) (p<0.001). Mean arterial pressure decreased from 84.4 (10.6) mmHg to 53.6 (11.4) mmHg (p<0.001). However, cerebral tissue oxygen saturation remained stable (67.0 (9.4) % vs 67.5 (7.8) %, p=0.6).

In this setting, we hypothesized that Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring might be helpful in shortening the patient's awakening and in predicting recovery of consciousness in order to initiate reliable intraoperative brain mapping.
An observational prospective study was performed on 27 consecutive asleep-awake craniotomies, in which BIS was monitored and BIS data collected offline. Nine critical intraoperative time points were defined and analyzed [preinduction, start of surgery, termination of hypnotic drug, eye opening, obeying simple commands, laryngeal mask airway (LMA) removal, initiation of brain mapping, initiation of closure, and end of surgery].
A shorter time to LMA removal was associated with a higher BIS at the termination of the hypnotic drug (P=0.016, Mann-Whitney U test). From the initiation of surgery to the time of LMA removal, BIS was significantly lower than the preinduction values, whereas at the initiation of brain mapping, BIS returned to the preinduction values (Friedman test P<0.0001, Dunns multiple comparisons test). Compared with LMA removal, BIS values >85 predicted the initiation of brain mapping with a sensitivity of 44% (95% confidence interval, 25.5%-64.7%) and a specificity of 74% (95% confidence interval, 53.7%-89%).
During asleep-awake craniotomies, higher BIS values at the end of the asleep phase are associated with shorter time to LMA removal, suggesting that BIS monitoring may be beneficial in shortening recovery from anesthesia. During the awake phase, the return of BIS to the preinduction values appeared to indicate full recovery of consciousness, thereby allowing a reliable language testing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23603886/
23521699,The ability of bispectral index to detect intra-operative wakefulness during total intravenous anaesthesia compared with the isolated forearm technique.,Anaesthesia,2013,Russell IF,"It has been suggested that monitoring during total intravenous anaesthesia should include aspects of brain function. The current study used a manually adjusted target-controlled infusion of propofol for anaesthesia, guided to a bispectral index range of 55-60. Intra-operative responsiveness, as assessed by the isolated forearm technique, was compared with whether the bispectral index predicted/identified a patient's appropriate hand movements in responses to commands. Twenty-two women underwent major gynaecological surgery with total intravenous anaesthesia, propofol, remifentanil and atracurium. Sixteen women responded, on 80 occasions, with appropriate hand movements to commands during surgery, of which the bispectral index detected 47 (sensitivity 59%). The bispectral index suggested consciousness 220 times in the absence of movement responses (specificity 85%). The positive predictive value of a bispectral index response was 18%. While two women had vague recall about squeezing fingers, none had recall of surgery. For patients who responded more than once during surgery the bispectral index value associated with a response was not constant. Although there was no difference in the median (IQR [range]) effect site propofol concentration between intra-operative responses (2.0 (1.5-2.3 [1.2-4.0]) μg.ml(-1)) and eye opening after surgery (2.1 (1.7-2.8 [1.5-3.9]) μg.ml(-1)), the median (IQR [range]) bispectral index value at eye opening after surgery was significantly higher than that associated with responses during surgery: 75 (70-78 [51-93]) vs 61 (52-67 [37-80]) respectively, (p < 0.001). The manual control of propofol intravenous anaesthesia to target a bispectral index range of 55-60 may result in an unacceptable number of patients who are conscious during surgery (albeit without recall).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23521699/

The purpose of this pilot study was to compare the cerebral physiologic effects of sedation with propofol versus dexmedetomidine in mechanically-ventilated, brain-injured patients. Using a randomised, crossover, unblinded clinical trial, we enrolled patients with severe brain injury (Glasgow Coma Score ≤8) from traumatic injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage or intracerebral haemorrhage undergoing multimodal monitoring (intracranial pressure, brain temperature, oximetry and microdialysis). Patients received an infusion of either propofol or dexmedetomidine for six hours and then a crossover for the subsequent six hours after sufficient washout/in. Clinical and physiological measurements were recorded hourly. In eight patients, (four traumatic injury, three subarachnoid haemorrhage and one intracerebral haemorrhage), the mean dose of propofol used was 25.5 µg/kg/minute while the mean dose of dexmedetomidine was 0.54 µg/kg/hour. All subjects were effectively sedated to a goal of Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale -2 and Bispectral Index of 50-70 throughout the study period. We did not observe any statistically significant differences between the groups in systemic or cerebral physiologic metrics. Though differences were noted in cerebral metabolic substrates (lactate/pyruvate ratio), none were statistically significant. In our pilot cohort, dexmedetomidine and propofol appear equally effective in sedating severely brain-injured patients and neither is associated with adverse physiological effects as measured by multimodal monitoring.

Prospective monocenter observational study in 24 TBI treated with barbiturates: 13 UFI and 11 DI. Simultaneous BIS and EEG was recorded for 1h. Goal of monitoring was a left BIS between 5 and 15. Biases in BIS were considered as clinically relevant if greater than 5. Differences in biases were interpreted from both statistical (Mann-Whitney test) and clinical points of view.
Mean BIS in the two hemispheres remained in the same monitoring range. There were statistic and clinical differences in some values in the two groups of patients (15% of bias greater than I5I in UFI group and 10% in DI group). BIS monitoring allowed the adequate number of bursts/minutes to be predicted in 18 patients and did not detect an overdosage in 2.

23027226,BIS-guided anesthesia decreases postoperative delirium and cognitive decline.,Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,2013,"Chan MT, Cheng BC, Lee TM, Gin T, ","Previous clinical trials and animal experiments have suggested that long-lasting neurotoxicity of general anesthetics may lead to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Brain function monitoring such as the bispectral index (BIS) facilitates anesthetic titration and has been shown to reduce anesthetic exposure. In a randomized controlled trial, we tested the effect of BIS monitoring on POCD in 921 elderly patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either BIS-guided anesthesia or routine care. The BIS group had anesthesia adjusted to maintain a BIS value between 40 and 60 during maintenance of anesthesia. Routine care group had BIS measured but not revealed to attending anesthesiologists. Anesthesia was adjusted according to traditional clinical signs and hemodynamic parameters. A neuropsychology battery of tests was administered before and at 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Results were compared with matched control patients who did not have surgery during the same period. Delirium was measured using the confusion assessment method criteria.
The median (interquartile range) BIS values during the maintenance period of anesthesia were significantly lower in the control group, 36 (31 to 49), compared with the BIS-guided group, 53 (48 to 57), P<0.001. BIS-guided anesthesia reduced propofol delivery by 21% and that for volatile anesthetics by 30%. There were fewer patients with delirium in the BIS group compared with routine care (15.6% vs. 24.1%, P=0.01). Although cognitive performance was similar between groups at 1 week after surgery, patients in the BIS group had a lower rate of POCD at 3 months compared with routine care (10.2% vs. 14.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.98; P=0.025).
BIS-guided anesthesia reduced anesthetic exposure and decreased the risk of POCD at 3 months after surgery.

22950534,Sedation for critically ill or injured adults in the intensive care unit: a shifting paradigm.,Drugs,2012,"Roberts DJ, Haroon B, Hall RI","As most critically ill or injured patients will require some degree of sedation, the goal of this paper was to comprehensively review the literature associated with use of sedative agents in the intensive care unit (ICU). The first and selected latter portions of this article present a narrative overview of the shifting paradigm in ICU sedation practices, indications for uninterrupted or prolonged ICU sedation, and the pharmacology of sedative agents. In the second portion, we conducted a structured, although not entirely systematic, review of the available evidence associated with use of alternative sedative agents in critically ill or injured adults. Data sources for this review were derived by searching OVID MEDLINE and PubMed from their first available date until May 2012 for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses and economic evaluations. Advances in the technology of mechanical ventilation have permitted clinicians to limit the use of sedation among the critically ill through daily sedative interruptions or other means. These practices have been reported to result in improved mortality, a decreased length of ICU and hospital stay and a lower risk of drug-associated delirium. However, in some cases, prolonged or uninterrupted sedation may still be indicated, such as when patients develop intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury. The pharmacokinetics of sedative agents have clinical importance and may be altered by critical illness or injury, co-morbid conditions and/or drug-drug interactions. Although use of validated sedation scales to monitor depth of sedation is likely to reduce adverse events, they have no utility for patients receiving neuromuscular receptor blocking agents. Depth of sedation monitoring devices such as the Bispectral Index (BIS©) also have limitations. Among existing RCTs, no sedative agent has been reported to improve the risk of mortality among the critically ill or injured. Moreover, although propofol may be associated with a shorter time to tracheal extubation and recovery from sedation than midazolam, the risk of hypertriglyceridaemia and hypotension is higher with propofol. Despite dexmedetomidine being linked with a lower risk of drug-associated delirium than alternative sedative agents, this drug increases risk of bradycardia and hypotension. Among adults with severe traumatic brain injury, there are insufficient data to suggest that any single sedative agent decreases the risk of subsequent poor neurological outcomes or mortality. The lack of examination of confounders, including the type of healthcare system in which the investigation was conducted, is a major limitation of existing pharmacoeconomic analyses, which likely limits generalizability of their results.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22950534/

The values of half maximum effective concentrations (EC50), 5% effective concentrations (EC05) and 95% effective concentrations (EC95) of propofol effect-site concentration at the onset of unconsciousness were 1.2 (1.1-1.3 µg/ml), 2.5 (2.4-2.5 µg/ml) and 3.7 (3.7-3.8 µg/ml), while those of the predicted plasma propofol concentration were 2.8 (2.7-2.9 µg/ml), 3.9 (3.8-3.9 µg/ml) and 4.9 (4.8-5.0 µg/ml), respectively. The values of BIS, SE and RE were 62, 59 and 63 when 50% of patients lost consciousness, and 79, 80, 85 and 42, 37, 44, respectively, when 5% and 95% of patients were unconscious. The values of BIS, RE and SE dropped two minutes after the injection of muscle relaxant, but there were no significant differences between RE and SE. MAP and HR increased visibly, which indicated a reaction to tracheal intubation; the values of BIS, RE and SE, however, did not display any significant changes.
This large-sample multicentric study confirmed the values of RE and SE as approximating BIS value, at the onset of unconsciousness during propofol TCI anesthesia. After elimination of myoelectrical activation, all values of RE, SE and BIS decreased significantly and the three indices were less sensitive to noxious stimuli than cardiovascular responses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22613640/

To demonstrate the limited value of topical pharyngeal anesthesia in patients under moderate to deep sedation with propofol.
One hundred and twenty-nine patients undergoing gastroscopy were prospectively randomized to receive 10 % lidocaine or distilled water topical spray as an adjunct to intravenous propofol via target-controlled infusion. Verbal and somatic responsiveness, presence of gag reflex and hiccup to esophageal intubation, and the overall ease of the procedure were evaluated by the anaesthetists and gastroenterologists. Hemodynamic parameters including peripheral oxygen saturation, systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), heart rate (HR), bispectral index, and SBP × HR were compared at 5 time points: on arrival, after 5 spontaneous breaths, when estimated brain concentration of propofol, Ce, reached 3.5 μg/ml, on esophageal intubation, and on awakening.
No statistical difference was observed between the lidocaine and distilled water group in verbal or somatic responses, gag reflex or hiccups on esophageal intubation. Similarly, BIS, SBP, DBP, and HR showed no significant difference between the groups.
The use of topical pharyngeal anesthesia in combination with target-controlled infusion with propofol in the performance of diagnostic gastroscopy might be eliminated without adversely affecting patient care or outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22562540/

EEG data of 40 patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia with either sevoflurane/remifentanil or propofol/remifentanil were replayed to an EEG player and reanalysed by a BIS A-2000® monitor and a Cerebral State Monitor. Further, research into differences between CSI and BIS index values was performed, e.g., extraction of differences of ≥ 10 and ≥ 20 index points and of the EEG length with differing index values.
The overall correlation coefficient was 0.68 without significant difference between propofol or sevoflurane group. In 51.8% of all recordings, both EEG monitors agreed in their classification of the anesthetic level. The number and length of differing index pairs was influenced by varying time delays of index calculation and different algorithms of index computation.
In contrast to previous studies, our current approach combines the following conditions: analysis on basis of identical underlying EEG data from deep to light anesthesia, no guidance of anesthetic administration by one of the EEG-based monitors, avoidance of simultaneous EEG readings and the use of two different anesthetic regimens. Though the result of EEG analysis during anesthesia is similar with both monitors, CSI performance during propofol anesthesia was superior to sevoflurane anesthesia. Consequently, a lower agreement of classification of anesthetic levels between BIS and CSI was reached with the use of sevoflurane. Thus, CSI calculation seems not to be independent from anesthetic agent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22310192/

In clinical practice, we have noticed a rise in the numerical values of bispectral index (BIS) and Entropy, two electroencephalogram (EEG) - based depth of anesthesia monitors, during the reversal of the NMB with sugammadex. The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study was to test this impression and to compare the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on the BIS and Entropy values during the reversal of the NMB.
Thirty patients undergoing gynecological operations were studied. Patients were anesthetized with target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil, and rocuronium was used to induce NMB. After operation, during light propofol-remifentanil anesthesia, NMB was antagonized with sugammadex or neostigmine. During the following 5 min, the numerical values of BIS, BIS electromyographic (BIS EMG) and Entropy were recorded on a laptop computer, as well as the biosignal recorded by the Entropy strip. The Entropy biosignal was studied off-line both in time and frequency domain to see if NMB reversal causes changes in EEG.
In some patients, administration of sugammadex or neostigmine caused a significant rise in the numerical values of BIS, BIS EMG and Entropy. This phenomenon was most likely caused by increased electromyographic (EMG) activity. The administration of sugammadex or neostigmine appeared to have only minimal effect on EEG.
The EMG contamination of EEG causes BIS and Entropy values to rise during reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB in light propofol-remifentanil anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22289106/

Although propofol and sevoflurane have been widely used during such surgery, there have been no data to compare the IOP changes under propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia. The present study was therefore conducted to investigate IOP changes under propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia during prone spine surgery.
After institutional approval and informed consent, 24 patients undergoing prone spine surgery were studied. Patients were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups: the propofol or sevoflurane group. Propofol or sevoflurane was administered to maintain the bispectral index between 40 and 60. The IOP was measured using a Tonopen XL hand-held tonometer 10 minutes after induction of anesthesia in the supine position (baseline), 10, 60, and 120 minutes after positioning in the prone position, and 10 minutes after returning to the supine position.
There were no significant differences in IOP values at baseline between the 2 groups. IOP values after positioning in the prone position were significantly higher than those at baseline in both groups (propofol group: from 8.9±3.5 to 21.9±5.0 mm Hg; sevoflurane group: from 11.6±3.9 to 24.8±3.4 mm Hg; P<0.05). Although IOP values were higher in the sevoflurane group than in the propofol group, the differences in IOP values were not statistically significant.
The results indicated that the choice of anesthetic agent, sevoflurane or propofol, did not have significant effects on IOP changes during a relatively short interval of prone spine surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22274735/

Its excellent haemodynamic tolerance gives it a wide therapeutic index. This halogenated agent can abolish movement [minimal alveolar concentration (MAC)] or haemodynamic responses (MACBAR) to noxious stimulus in children as in adults. Reflex pupillary dilatation (RPD) has been demonstrated as a very sensitive measure of noxious stimulation. In order to investigate the effect of sevoflurane on the RPD, a subcortical reflex, we determined the MAC of sevoflurane inhibiting the RPD in 50% of the subjects in response to skin incision (MACpup) in pre- and post-pubertal subjects.
We included 30 pre-pubertal children and 19 post-pubertal subjects. Patients received sevoflurane at preselected concentrations according to an 'up and down' design, and after a steady-state period, skin incision was performed. The RPD was considered as significant when the pupillary diameter increased by more than 100%. Heart rate (HR) and bispectral index (BIS) changes were analysed according to the pupillary response.
The MACpup of sevoflurane was 4.8% (95% confidence interval, 4.6-5.1%) in pre-pubertal children vs 3.4% (3.5-3.3%) in post-pubertal subjects (P<0.001). Inhibition of RPD was always associated with lack of significant HR response. In pre-pubertal children receiving high concentrations of sevoflurane, RPD in response to noxious stimulation was frequently associated with lack of HR response and low BIS values.
MACpup was higher than MAC and close to the MACBAR. Inhibition of RPD in pre-pubertal children required higher sevoflurane concentrations compared with post-pubertal subjects, suggesting that the relationship between the brain structure sensitivities may differ with brain maturation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22265901/

In addition to standard and advanced monitors typically used during cardiac surgery, anesthesiologists may consider monitoring the brain with raw or processed electroencephalography (EEG). There is strong evidence that a protocol incorporating the processed EEG bispectral index (BIS) decreases the incidence intraoperative awareness in comparison with standard practice. However, there is conflicting evidence that incorporating the BIS into cardiac anesthesia practice improves ""fast-tracking,"" decreases anesthetic drug use, or detects cerebral ischemia. Recent research, including many cardiac surgical patients, shows that a protocol based on BIS monitoring is not superior to a protocol based on end-tidal anesthetic concentration monitoring in preventing awareness. There has been a resurgence of interest in the anesthesia literature in limited montage EEG monitoring, including nonproprietary processed indices. This has been accompanied by research showing that with structured training, anesthesiologists can glean useful information from the raw EEG trace.

We compared the performance of IAADS with the manual control isoflurane administration during cardiac surgery.
Forty patients of ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status class II-III, undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in a tertiary care hospital in India were randomized to receive isoflurane through a closed-loop system (IAADS group) or through a Tech 7 vaporizer adjusted manually (manual group) to achieve a target BIS of 50. Patients were induced with a propofol infusion and isoflurane was started after intubation. During CPB, patients received propofol; isoflurane was restarted after separation from CPB. The efficacy of IAADS in controlling depth of anesthesia and hemodynamic variations was compared with that of manual control.
IAADS was able to maintain BIS within ± 10 of target for significantly longer period (84.6 ± 7.2% in IAADS group vs. 75.9 ± 11.2 in manual group, p < 0.01). Both overall performance, as assessed by global score (p < 0.01), and precision, as judged by median absolute performance error (MDAPE) (p < 0.04), were significantly better in the IAADS group. The IAADS group required significantly less propofol for induction (1.3 ± 0.4 mg/kg in IAADS vs. 1.6 ± 0.5 mg/kg in manual, p < 0.05) and less isoflurane during maintenance of anesthesia (3.3 ± 0.8 ml/h vs. 3.4 ± 0.9 ml/h, p < 0.01).

Bispectral index (BIS) is an electrophysiological parameter to determine the clinical state of anesthesia. The aim of the present study is to evaluate correlation between GCS and BIS in patients suffering from head injury and to see if we can use BIS values as a prognostic factor in head trauma.
In this analytic study 61 consecutive patients with traumatic head injury admitted to the intensive care unit from January till June 2010 were examined. In each case the GCS and BIS values were measured and compared regarding different degrees of head injuries.
Mean BIS in mild injury group was 96.20 ± 3.27 and in moderate injury group was 45.57 ± 1.28 and in severe injury group was 31.37 ± 2.08. There was a significant correlation between GCS and mean BIS (r = 0.88; P < 0.05). Mean BIS values were significantly different between mild, moderate and severe head injuries (96.2 ± 3.2, 45.5 ± 1.2, and 31.3 ± 2.08, respectively; P < 0.05).
We found significant correlation between GCS and BIS in patients with traumatic head injury, so BIS can be used in addition to GCS for prediction of outcome in these patients specially in patients who are sedated or are intubated or in other case in whom GCS values cannot be determined accurately.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22042690/
21971395,Does depth of anesthesia monitoring improve postoperative outcomes?,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2011,"Monk TG, Weldon BC","Devices using the electroencephalogram to estimate anesthetic depth have been available since 1996. Despite the use of these monitors for over a decade, there is little agreement among clinicians about the need for or value of depth of anesthesia monitoring. Since the majority of the studies evaluating the impact of depth of anesthesia monitoring on postoperative outcomes have utilized the bispectral index (BIS Covidian), this manuscript will focus on studies with this device. This review will evaluate the evidence that BIS monitoring can improve long-term outcomes.
BIS-guided anesthesia can reduce the incidence of awareness with recall in high-risk patients, but a recent study found that anesthetic management directed by an end-tidal anesthetic-agent concentration protocol is equally effective, and probably less expensive. Deep anesthesia (BIS < 45) during the intraoperative period is associated with increased postoperative mortality, but this relationship may be an epiphenomenon rather than causal.
There is growing concern that anesthetic management and even specific anesthetic agents may worsen outcomes in high-risk patients. There is, however, no conclusive evidence that depth of anesthesia monitors can improve outcomes and no evidenced-based reasons for anesthesia providers to change their current practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21971395/

Traditionally, invasive arterial blood pressure has been used for continuous monitoring of these changes. This prospective study evaluated the efficacy of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring during SVT. The use of NIRS has expanded with evidence of its accuracy and benefit in detecting cerebral hypoperfusion. This study aimed first to determine the hemodynamic changes associated with electrophysiology testing for SVT and second to determine whether the hemodynamic changes are associated with similar changes in the cerebral saturation as determined by NIRS. The study enrolled 30 patients 5-20 years of age with a history of SVT who underwent an EPS. The demographic data included age, gender, weight, height, and type of SVT. Hemodynamic data (invasive blood pressure and heart rate), NIRS, bispectral index (BIS), end-tidal carbon dioxide, and pulse oximetry were collected before and during three episodes of induced SVT. The linear correlation coefficient (r) was measured to calculate the relationship of the changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to the changes in NIRS values during the SVT episodes. Data from 22 patients were collected. The induction of SVT was associated mainly with a change in SBP and a less prominent change in DBP and MAP from baseline. The changes in hemodynamic status were associated with minimal changes in cerebral saturations, as evidenced by an average absolute change in NIRS of <1 from baseline value. The changes in hemodynamics were correlated linearly with cerebral saturation. Changes in SBP, DBP, and MAP were correlated positively with changes in NIRS, as denoted by (r) values of 0.52, 0.57, and 0.67 respectively, and a P value less than 0.05 for all three association tests. Induction of SVT during electrophysiology testing is associated with hemodynamic changes, mainly in SBP. In this study, these hemodynamic changes resulted in a minimal decrease in cerebral perfusion, as evidenced by minimal changes in the cerebral saturation measured by NIRS (0.7% from baseline). Although the changes in the cerebral saturation were minimal, these changes were linearly correlated with the changes in the hemodynamics. This study is the first to demonstrate the possible application of NIRS monitoring during EPS and to document that despite changes in the hemodynamic status, the changes in cerebral oxygenation are minimal, thereby confirming the safety of EPS for SVT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21965125/

In rodent brain, bilirubin can enhance γ-aminobutyric acid A/glycinergic synaptic transmission. Etomidate is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic that induces sedation through γ-aminobutyric acid A receptors in the central nervous system. We tested the hypothesis that patients with obstructive jaundice have an altered sensitivity to etomidate.
The study design was a comparison of etomidate requirements to reach a Bispectral Index of 50 in patients with obstructive jaundice versus patients with chronic cholelithiasis and normal bilirubin levels. Etomidate was infused at 30 μg/kg/min until this end point was reached.
The etomidate requirement in the obstructive jaundice group was lower than that in the control group (150±46 μg/kg vs 206±74 μg/kg, P=0.007). The average decrease in etomidate requirement was 56 μg/kg (95% confidence interval: 16-96 μg/kg). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation between serum total bilirubin and etomidate requirement with Pearson r of -0.545, and 95% confidence interval for r value (-0.791 to -0.148).

We tested the hypothesis that a protocol incorporating the electroencephalogram-derived bispectral index (BIS) is superior to a protocol incorporating standard monitoring of end-tidal anesthetic-agent concentration (ETAC) for the prevention of awareness.
We conducted a prospective, randomized, evaluator-blinded trial at three medical centers. We randomly assigned 6041 patients at high risk for awareness to BIS-guided anesthesia (with an audible alert if the BIS value was <40 or >60, on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the suppression of detectable brain electrical activity and 100 indicating the awake state) or ETAC-guided anesthesia (with an audible alert if the ETAC was <0.7 or >1.3 minimum alveolar concentration). In addition to audible alerts, the protocols included structured education and checklists. Superiority of the BIS protocol was assessed with the use of a one-sided Fisher's exact test.

This was a prospective observational trial with waiver of consent conducted in the intensive care unit of Level I trauma center in 94 mechanically ventilated trauma patients sedated with propofol alone or in combination with midazolam. BIS, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), electromyography, and heart rate variability, as a test of autonomic function, were measured for 45 minutes during daily SATs. Data were evaluated with analysis of variance, linear regression, and nonparametric tests.
The BIS wave form coincided almost exactly with propofol on/off. Steady-state BIS correlated with RASS (p < 0.0001) and with propofol dose (p < 0.0001), but the strengths of association were relatively low (all r(2) < 0.5). BIS wave form was not altered by age, heart rate, or heart rate variability and was similar with propofol alone or propofol plus midazolam, but the presence of brain injury or the use of paralytics shifted the curve downward (both p < 0.001). The overall test characteristics for BIS versus RASS without neuromuscular blockade were sensitivity: 90% versus 77% (p = 0.034); specificity: 90% versus 75% (p = 0.021); positive predictive value: 90% versus 76% (p = 0.021), and negative predictive value: 90% versus 76% (p = 0.021).

The aim of this pilot study was to use the BIS monitor to evaluate the depth of procedural sedation in pediatric dental patients and to assess if the BIS monitor readings correlate with a validated pediatric sedation scale, the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS), in determining the level of sedation in these patients. Thirty-five pediatric dental patients requiring sedation were studied prospectively. A baseline BIS reading was obtained and during the procedure an independent observer recorded the BIS every 5 minutes. The operator, who was blinded to the BIS results, determined the UMSS scale at the same 5-minute interval. The patients were monitored postoperatively for 1 hour. There was a significant but moderate correlation between BIS values and UMSS scores (Spearman's rank correlation r  =  -0.574, P < .0001). Percentage of agreement and kappa coefficient using all the observations were also calculated. The percentage of agreement was 37.8%, the kappa coefficient was 0.18 (P < .0001), and the weighted kappa coefficient 0.26 (P < .0001). A lack of correlation was noted between the deeper levels of UMSS sedation scores and BIS values. This study demonstrated a significant correlation between BIS values and the UMSS score in pediatric dental patients undergoing mild to moderate sedation. Based on our results, it appears that the BIS monitor may be useful during mild or moderate sedations to establish the level of sedation objectively without the need to stimulate the patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21679042/

As the number of cases in the office-based setting increase, many clinicians opt to intubate patients without neuromuscular blockade to avoid airway complications associated with skeletal muscle relaxation. Conventionally, this technique is conducted using the traditional monitoring criteria of vital signs, end-tidal inhalation agents, as well as anesthesiologist timing and knowledge of the pharmacodynamics of the anesthetic agent to help determine the proper depth of anesthesia for adequate intubating conditions. This study retrospectively assesses the use of the Bispectral Index System (BIS) as a guide for timing of nonparalytic tracheal intubation in pediatric office-based general anesthesia. Anesthetic records for 168 children, American Society of Anesthesiology physical status I and II, and ranging in age from 18 months to 17 years were retrospectively analyzed. Intubation outcomes were based on 6 preset criteria to reflect the adequacy of the technique. The mean BIS value during the time of intubation was 34.7. There were no complications encountered. A BIS mean value of 34.7 provided adequate intubation conditions without muscle relaxation in office-based pediatric anesthesia without complications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21410358/

A similar dilutional effect on accompanying volatile anesthetic agent has not been evaluated and may impact the speed of emergence.
Twenty patients undergoing surgery were randomly assigned to receive an anesthetic maintenance gas mixture of sevoflurane adjusted to bispectral index, in air-oxygen (control group) versus a 2:1 mixture of nitrous oxide-oxygen (nitrous oxide group). After surgery, baseline arterial and tidal gas samples were taken. Patients were ventilated with oxygen, and arterial and tidal gas sampling was repeated at 2 and 5 min. Arterial sampling was repeated 30 min after surgery. Sevoflurane partial pressure was measured in blood by the double headspace equilibration technique and in tidal gas using a calibrated infrared gas analyzer. Time to eye opening and time extubation were recorded. The primary endpoint was the reduction in sevoflurane partial pressures in blood at 2 and 5 min.
Relative to baseline, arterial sevoflurane partial pressure was 39% higher at 5 min in the control group (P < 0.04) versus the nitrous oxide group. At 30 min the difference was not statistically significant. Time to eye opening (8.7 vs. 10.1 min) and time to extubation (11.0 vs.13.2 min) were shorter in the nitrous oxide group versus the control group (P < 0.04).
Elimination of nitrous oxide at the end of anesthesia produces a clinically significant acceleration in the reduction of concentrations of the accompanying volatile agents, contributing to the speed of emergence observed after inhalational nitrous oxide anesthetic.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21270630/

BIS value gradually decreased and reached 0 17 h after commencement of continuous infusion of midazolam. Midazolam infusion was stopped but BIS value remained 0. Brain CT scan revealed an almost normal image. Multi-lead electroencephalogram was recorded revealing almost no electrical activity. Administration of flumazenil did not improve his consciousness and BIS value. Adequate spontaneous respiration was maintained and the possibility of brain death was excluded. LDLT was performed on the 5th ICU day. BIS value remained 0 throughout surgery. BIS value suddenly increased 2 h after surgery and reached 60 11 h after surgery. It became possible to communicate with the patient and his trachea was extubated on the 4th postoperative day.

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,2010,"Yoshimitsu K, Suzuki T, Muragaki Y, Chernov M, Iseki H","Gliomas represent the most frequent type of primary intracranial tumors, which originate from the brain tissue itself, have infiltrative growth, unclear borders, and usually affect functionally-important cerebral structures. From March 2000 till March 2010, 839 neurosurgical procedures directed on resection of such neoplasms were performed in the intelligent operating theater of Tokyo Women's Medical University with the use of intraoperative MRI, real-time updated neuronavigation system, and Hi-vision operative microscope. To facilitate maximal possible tumor resection with minimal risk of neurological morbidity a special device, called Intraoperative Examination Monitor for Awake Surgery (IEMAS) was developed by us. It provides an opportunity to visualize a wide spectrum of inraoperative information related to condition of the patient, nuances of the surgical procedure, and details of the cortical mapping. The wide set of both anatomical and functional parameters, such as view of the patient's mimic and face movements during answering on the specific questions, type of examination test, position of the surgical instruments, parameters of the bispectral index monitor, and general view of the surgical field through the operating microscope and/or endoscope, is presented compactly in one screen with several displays, which allows fast integrated real-time analysis of the multiple data, nearly without interruption of the surgical manipulations. All members of the surgical team can share this information using several in-room liquid crystal displays. However, the initially designed IEMAS system was occasionally affected by interruption or detachment of the connecting cables, which could interfere with effective advancement of the surgical procedure. To avoid this problem a modified device was created. Its specific feature is wireless information transmitting function attained by incorporation of transmitters with a frequency range of 2.4 GHz. The clinical testing of t- - his system was initiated on February 1, 2010, but quickly revealed crossed line effect between transmitters and receivers. To overcome this obstacle and to isolate transmitters, one channel was changed from wireless connection into wired, which resulted in significant improvement of the clearness of both transmitted images and sounds, and provides an opportunity for effective clinical use of the device. In perspective we wish to make IEMAS system fully wireless, using several types of frequency range transmitters.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21097121/

We investigated the effect of adding N2O to sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia on BIS and SE.
A total of 28 patients were randomized to receive general anesthesia using either 2% sevoflurane or 120 mcg/kg/min propofol during surgery. After 20 minutes of stable anesthetic and surgical conditions (baseline), 60% N2O was added for 20 minutes. Another 20 minutes was allowed for washout after N2O was discontinued. Sevoflurane concentration was closely monitored using the standard end-tidal gas analysis and vaporizer output was constantly adjusted to offset the second-gas effect caused by the addition and discontinuation of N2O. Mean values for BIS and SE were calculated for the last 5 minutes of the baseline, nitrous oxide, and washout periods.
In the propofol group, BIS and SE values in baseline versus N2O periods were 40±10 versus 39±10 and 43±11 versus 43±12, respectively (mean±SD, P>0.05). In the sevoflurane group, addition of N2O decreased both BIS (36±7 to 32±7, P<0.001) and SE (37±10 to 31±11, P=0.001). The magnitude of change from the baseline in BIS and SE in the sevoflurane group was 3.6±3.8 (95% CI: 0.8-6.5) and 6.1±5.5 (95% CI: 3.7-8.6), respectively. Average baseline and washout values of BIS and SE were not different in both groups (P>0.05).
N2O decreased both BIS and SE when added to sevoflurane, but not propofol. The observed changes in the sevoflurane group were not clinically significant. Decreases in BIS and SE in the sevoflurane group could result from a true additive effect and second-gas effect of N2O that was unaccounted for despite a meticulous titration of sevoflurane using end-tidal gas monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20844378/

One theory states that neuromuscular blockade prevents disturbing EMG signals, arousing from the muscles of the forehead, from falsely elevating bispectral index (BIS)-levels. According to the afferentation theory signals generated in muscle stretch receptors, accessing the brain through afferent nerve pathways, induce arousal. By blocking these signals neuromuscular blockade would increase depth of anesthesia. Arousal has previously been associated with neostigmine reversal. This study investigates the possible effect of sugammadex on the level of anesthesia as defined by BIS and spectral entropy levels.
Thirty elective patients were enrolled. All patients received propofol and remifentanil by target controlled infusion and an intermediate level neuromuscular blockade induced and maintained by bolus doses of rocuronium. Depth of anesthesia was monitored by BIS and spectral entropy. The patients were given 2 mg/kg sugammadex 5 min after finishing of surgery. Propofol and remifentanil infusions were kept unchanged for another 10 min while BIS and entropy values were recorded.
Mean BIS and Entropy™ values remained unchanged after reversal of the rocuronium block. The mean averaged BIS, state entropy and response entropy values were 31.7 ± 9.9, 35.3 ± 12.9 and 36.8 ± 13.3 before and 32.0 ± 11.9, 36.3 ± 15.9 and 38.4 ± 18.0 after sugammadex administration, respectively.

However, this conventional theory may be wrong, because, according to recent animal studies, minimum alveolar concentration indicates anesthetic effect on the spinal cord but not on the brain. The aim of this electroencephalographic study was to investigate the differences in the hypnotic effect of sevoflurane on parturients and nonpregnant patients.
Fifteen parturients undergoing cesarean section and 15 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery were enrolled. Anesthesia was induced with 4 mg/kg thiopental, 2 microg/kg fentanyl, and 2 mg/kg suxamethonium or 0.15 mg/kg vecuronium. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and fentanyl. The electroencephalographic signals, obtained from the bispectral index monitor, were recorded on a computer. We calculated 95% spectral edge frequency, amplitude, and bicoherence using custom software (Bispectrum Analyzer for bispectral index). After confirming that end-tidal sevoflurane had reached equilibrium, we measured electroencephalographic parameters of sevoflurane at 2.0 and 1.5% during surgery and at 1.0 and 0.5% after surgery.
With the decrease of end-tidal sevoflurane concentration from 2.0 to 0.5%, 95% spectral edge frequency, amplitude, bispectral index, and bicoherence values changed dose-dependently in pregnant and nonpregnant women (P<0.0001). However, there were no significant differences in those electroencephalographic parameters in pregnant and nonpregnant women.
This electroencephalographic study has shown that pregnancy does not enhance hypnotic effect of sevoflurane. These results suggested that the decrease in minimum alveolar concentration during pregnancy does not mean an enhanced volatile anesthetic effect on the brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20693882/

Forty pediatric patients, age 6.6 +/- 3.3 years, weight 24 +/- 9 kg, scheduled for surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia were enrolled. Two minutes after i.v. injection of 0.3 mcg.kg(-1) of sufentanil, general anesthesia was induced by an initial bolus of 3 mg.kg(-1) of propofol, followed by a continuous infusion titrated to achieve a stable BIS value of 50 +/- 5. Patients received either mivacurium 0.25 mg.kg(-1) (Group Miva) or NaCl 0.9% 0.12 ml.kg(-1) (Group Control). Mean BIS and CSI values per minute were compared between (Miva vs. Control) and within groups (Baseline vs 5 min. after study drug administration).
The observed changes in BIS and CSI values before and after administration of study drugs revealed no differences between the study groups. Mean baseline BIS and CSI values were lower than 5 min after study drug administration. There were no intergroup differences with respect to BIS and CSI values at any time point.

Point-of-care monitoring can potentially dictate changes to management intraoperatively. In this observational study, we examined the correlation between a series of point-of-care monitors and lactate flux during CEA.
Both neurosurgeons and vascular surgeons participated in the study. The patients underwent arterial-jugular venous blood sampling for oxygen, carbon dioxide, glucose, and lactate, n = 26; bispectral index (BIS) monitoring ipsilateral to side of surgery, n = 26; raw and processed electroencephalogram (EEG), n = 22; and bi-frontal cerebral oximetry using the Fore-Sight monitor, n = 20.
One patient experienced a new neurological deficit when assessed at 24 hr following surgery. Lactate flux into the brain was correlated with the greatest decrease in cerebral oximetry with carotid cross-clamping; lactate efflux was correlated with the least. The most noticeable changes in processed EEG (density spectral analysis) were also seen with lactate influx, but at a slower time resolution than cerebral oximetry. Loss of autoregulatory behaviour was demonstrated with lactate influx; however, no correlation was seen between lactate flux and BIS monitoring.
There was a correlation between cerebral oximetry and lactate flux during carotid cross-clamping. The Fore-Sight monitor may be of value as a point-of-care monitor during CEA under general anesthesia. A novel finding of this study is lactate flux into the brain in the presence of a large difference in cerebral oxygenation during cross-clamping of the carotid artery.

We examined how the preoperative cognitive status, as assessed by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), may interact with propofol consumption during anaesthesia in the elderly.
In a prospective study, we recruited 41 patients (65-99 yr) undergoing surgery for hip fracture. Femoral nerve block was performed for analgesia. Target-controlled infusion of propofol (Schnider's model) was adjusted to the bispectral index within the range 40-60. Multiple linear regression analysis determined whether age, BMI, gender, duration of anaesthesia, and preoperative MMSE score affected the propofol consumption (general linear model, Systat 8.0).
BMI and MMSE score significantly affected the mean value of propofol consumption. A low MMSE score (below 19) was associated with an observed decrease in propofol requirement in patients >65 yr of age. No significant effect of age, gender, and duration of anaesthesia on the propofol consumption was observed.
Propofol requirement to maintain hypnosis during general anaesthesia appears to decrease with deterioration in the cognitive status in the elderly. We suggest that a cognitive dysfunction linked to a cerebral cholinergic dysfunction may influence the brain sensitivity for propofol in aged patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20650918/

Arterial plasma concentrations of propofol were collected up to 4 h after dosing, and BIS was collected before start of infusion and until the subjects were fully awake. The population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis was performed using NONMEM VI. A four-compartment PK model with time-dependent elimination and distribution described the arterial propofol concentrations, and was used as input to the pharmacodynamic model. A standard effect compartment model could not accurately describe the delay in the effects of propofol for both regimens, whereas a two-compartment effect site model significantly improved the predictions.

Subjects comprised 11 patients scheduled to undergo heart surgery under extracorporeal circulation. Anesthesia was maintained by intravenous administration of propofol combined with remifentanil, using a bispectral index (BIS) monitor to keep an identical BIS value (target BIS value, 40-45). Raw EEG signals were collected through the BIS monitor. Approximate entropy, bicoherence and power spectrum were analyzed before and after CPB, in addition to other EEG parameters.
In the late hypothermic CPB period, both 95% spectral edge frequency and approximate entropy decreased, notwithstanding a lack of significant difference in BIS index. Bicoherence growths in delta-theta and alpha areas decreased simultaneously.
In the late CPB period, although BIS value is unchanged, EEG often expresses a slow EEG rhythm accompanied by disproportional de-synchronous characteristics.
CPB caused the EEG de-synchronous features, which are not quantified by the BIS algorithm. It has the possibility to increase the vulnerability of nociceptive perception.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20382560/

Subsequently, to validate the findings of this case, processed EEG was recorded during 2 other cases in which care was withdrawn without the use of hypnotic or anesthetic drugs. We found that changes in processed EEG immediately after withdrawal of care were not only reproducible, but can happen in the absence of changes in major electromyographic or electrocardiographic artifact. It is well documented that processed EEG is prone to artifacts. However, in the setting of DCD, these changes in processed EEG deserve some consideration. If these changes are not due to artifact, dosing of hypnotic or anesthetic drugs might be warranted.

In addition, there are certain subjective tools such as the observer's assessment of alertness and sedation which are used. The correlation between BIS and the concentration of propofol in the brain, and the relationship between these subjective and objective tools in assessing sedation levels are the subject of this study.
Thirty healthy volunteers enrolled in this prospective observational study. They were sedated with a target controlled infusion of propofol with an initial target of 0.8 microg.mL(-1)and an increase in target to 0.2 microg.mL(-1) ten minutes after equilibration of the predicted and set target concentrations. In each sedation score, the Bispectral Index value and predicted effect site concentration of propofol were recorded and analyzed. Analysis of variance and significant differences between groups were analyzed by paired t-test. Correlations between Bispectral Index and effect site concentration of propofol at each sedation score and the relationship of BIS and effect site concentration of propofol to each sedation score were assessed and analyzed by nonparametric Spearman's rho.

The aim of this study was to explore the utility of using the new BIS-Vista monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) for occipital sensor placement in the patients undergoing brain neurosurgical procedures during propofol-remifentanil anesthesia.
Two BIS Quatro sensors (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) mounted on the occipital and frontal regions were connected to two BIS-Vista monitors at three anesthesia states: before induction, during anesthesia maintenance, and recovery.
There were significant differences before induction (P = 0.0002) and at anesthesia maintenance (P = 0.0014) between mean +/- SD occipital (83.4 +/- 4.8, 66.7 +/- 7.2) and frontal (93.1 +/- 3.4, 56.9 +/- 9.1) BIS-Vista values. During anesthesia recovery, there was no difference (P = 0.7421) between occipital (54.6 +/- 9.3) and frontal (53.1 +/- 7.3) BIS-Vista values. Bland and Altman analysis revealed a BIS-Vista negative-bias (limits of agreement) of -9.7 (+1.1, -20.5) before anesthesia induction, +9.8 positive-bias (+22.8, -1.7) during anesthesia maintenance, and -0.9 bias (+10.9, -12.8) during anesthesia recovery.
We demonstrated that not only the regional limits of agreement are too wide to allow data of the two montages to be used interchangeably but also the variation is a function of anesthetic depth. However, keeping in mind a relatively consistent BIS-Vista -10 bias before induction and +10 bias during anesthesia maintenance with limits of agreement of approximately +/-11 BIS units, approximately double the clinically acceptable less than 10 BIS units level of agreement, BIS-Vista off-label occipital montage might be helpful in following a trend of propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in individual cases where frontal access is particularly difficult.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20179501/

However, when duration between stimuli is different, such methods are not able to provide satisfactory results because they find equal size clusters according to the fundamental running principle of these methods. In such cases, neighborhood-based clustering methods can give more satisfactory results because measurement series are separated from one another according to dramatic breaking points. In recent years, bispectral index (BIS) monitoring, which is used for monitoring the level of anesthesia, has been used in sleep studies. Sleep stages are classically scored according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) scoring system. BIS has been shown to have a strong correlation with the R&K scoring system. In this study, fuzzy neighborhood/density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (FN-DBSCAN) that combines speed of the DBSCAN algorithm and robustness of the NRFJP algorithm is applied to BIS measurement series.

In the awake state, rGMR ranged from 0.24 to 0.35 mumol/g/min in the selected regions. Compared with the conscious state, total GMR decreased 56% in sevoflurane anaesthesia. In white and grey matter, GMR was averaged 42% and 58% of normal, respectively. Sevoflurane reduced the absolute rGMR in all selected areas by 48-71% of the baseline (P< or = 0.01), with the most significant reductions in the lingual gyrus (71%), occipital lobe in general (68%) and thalamus (63%). No increases in rGMR were observed.
Sevoflurane caused a global whole-brain metabolic reduction of GMR in all regions of the human brain, with the most marked metabolic suppression in the lingual gyrus, thalamus and occipital lobe.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20085540/

This study was undertaken to investigate BIS changes in awake patients with and without neurological deficits during carotid endarterectomy under regional anaesthesia.
Seventy consecutive carotid endarterectomies under regional anaesthesia were divided into two surgical groups: patients with and patients without neurological deficits. Patients' neurological status was evaluated and neurological deficits were compared with BIS values. Measurements were made at different surgical stages: baseline, after sedation, at the beginning of surgery, at preclamping, at the 3 min clamping test, during shunt insertion, at declamping, 15 min after declamping and at the end of surgery. We performed intergroup and intragroup comparisons of BIS values. A decrease in BIS of at least 10 associated with neurological deficits was taken as the cut-off point for the classification of patients with logistic regression models (crude and adjusted for potential confounders).
Thirteen patients (18.6% of the total) developed clinical cerebral ischaemia, though BIS values decreased in 10 of these patients (76.9%). The mean BIS values were 92.5+/-5.6 and 84.7+/-12.3 for patients without and with neurological deficits, respectively (P value<0.05). The odds ratios of a BIS decrease associated with neurological deficits were 8.5 (95% confidence interval 2.1-35.1) and 5.4 (95% confidence interval 1.2-24.3) adjusted for contralateral stenosis.

In 27 patients, there were 37 BD evaluations (apnea assessment or ancillary test). BD was confirmed in 62% (n = 23). However, 38% (n = 14) showed near BD. BD BIS is 3 + or - 5 and near BD BIS is 36 + or - 31 (P = .002). In the 23 BD patients, BIS was <20 for 7 hours + or - 6 hours before a BD evaluation was performed.

Annual International Conference,2009,"Castro A, Almeida FG, Amorim P, Nunes CS","With the recent concern on patient's outcome following general anesthesia, automatic control of drugs has been a field of interest. The Bispectral Index (BIS) is an EEG based hypnosis monitor, in current use at the operating theatre as a guiding tool for the anesthesiologist to titrate drugs, and prevent awareness. When trying to model a certain process, it's very important to obtain information of the system behavior under steady-state conditions. In this study the hypnotic and analgesic drugs' effect on the hypnosis index BIS was analyzed, in order to obtain steady-state information of the system response (inputs-output), and in the future model the drugs combined effect. A steady-state index was obtained using a wavelet analysis technique for trend detection.

Our objective was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of BIS changes during carotid clamping in relation to shunted patients in awake CEA.
Eighty CEAs under cervical block were included. There were two patient groups: with clinical signs of cerebral ischemia (shunted patients) and without signs of cerebral ischemia (nonshunted patients). Data were based on bispectral index (BIS) values and neurological monitoring at different surgery time points, with special attention paid during carotid clamping. BIS values were compared between shunted and nonshunted patients. Sensitivity and specificity, along with positive and negative predictive values of a percentage BIS value decrease during carotid clamping from baseline BIS values, were calculated in both patient groups.
Shunting was performed in 11 patients with cerebral ischemia at carotid clamping. Mean BIS values were 82.82+/-11.98 in shunted patients and 92.31+/-5.42 in nonshunted patients at carotid clamping (p<0.001). Relative decreased BIS values in relation to basal BIS values were 13.57% in shunted patients and 3.68% in nonshunted patients (p<0.05). The percentage decrease in BIS was 14%, sensitivity was 81.8% (95% CI 49.9-96.8), and specificity was 89.7% (95% CI 79.3-95.4).
BIS monitoring during carotid clamping is an easy, noninvasive method which correlates with cerebral ischemia in patients undergoing CEA. A decrease>or=14% from the basal BIS value presents a high negative predictive value, and ischemia is unlikely without a decrease. Nonetheless, a decrease may not always indicate cerebral ischemia with a low positive predictive value.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19932952/

Eighty-seven patients who had an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I-III and were scheduled to undergo an elective surgery with general anesthesia were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received auditory stimulation during surgery, whereas the other did not. The auditory stimulation consisted of pure tones presented via headphones. The Bispectral Index level was maintained between 40 and 50 during surgery. To assess learning, patients performed an auditory frequency discrimination task after surgery, and comparisons were made between the groups. General anesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained with a mixture of fentanyl and sevoflurane.
There was no difference in the amount of learning between the two groups (mean +/- SD improvement: stimulated patients 9.2 +/- 11.3 Hz, controls 9.4 +/- 14.1 Hz). There was also no difference in initial thresholds (mean +/- SD initial thresholds: stimulated patients 31.1 +/- 33.4 Hz, controls 28.4 +/- 34.2 Hz). These results suggest that perceptual learning was not induced during anesthesia. No correlation between the bispectral index and the initial level of performance was found (Pearson r = -0.09, P = 0.59).
Perceptual learning was not induced by repetitive auditory stimulation during anesthesia. This result may indicate that perceptual learning requires top-down processing, which is suppressed by the anesthetic.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19858871/

We report a case series of seven patients who were neurologically intact before the decision to withdraw care due to extensive systemic critical illness. As part of our end-of-life care protocol, bispectral index (BIS) monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) or SEDline (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) monitoring devices are placed on each patient to ensure adequate comfort. Both monitoring systems use an integer-based system (BIS or PSI, respectively) to reflect the level of consciousness/effect of anesthesia. In each case, loss of blood pressure, as monitored by indwelling arterial line, was followed by a decline is BIS/PSI activity followed by a transient spike in BIS/PSI activity that approached levels normally associated with consciousness. This spike in electroencephalogram (EEG) activity had short duration and the activity then declined to a level of activity associated with burst suppression. In one case of a patient who had a SEDLine device, we were able to capture and analyze the raw EEG signal, and confirm that the EEG waveform was not artifact, and in fact a high frequency waveform was present during the spike activity. We speculate that this level of BIS/SEDline activity is related to the cellular loss of membrane polarization due to hypoxemia. We further speculate that since this increase in electrical activity occurred when there was no discernable blood pressure, patients who suffer ""near death"" experiences may be recalling the aggregate memory of the synaptic activity associated with this terminal but potentially reversible hypoxemia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19803731/

The tentative and controversial findings of a 2006 study suggesting a correlation of mortality with lower intraoperative bispectral index scores were reproduced in a more recent study, but the correlation could be accounted for by controlling for patient comorbidities, particularly malignancy. In a large trial involving patients at high risk for awareness, general anesthesia with volatile agents guided by bispectral index monitoring was associated with a low incidence of awareness, but no more so than the use of alarms for limits on volatile agent concentration. Studies comparing both emerging and more established brain function monitors suggest that, in spite of their different algorithms for processing and filtering electromyographic signal, many monitors are affected by the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Recent evidence is consistent with previous studies that describe a nonlinear model for the dose-response of EEG parameters to increasing concentration of anesthetic agents with a dosing plateau response over a clinically relevant dose range.

In addition, we analyzed the k(e0) values of the different anesthetics. The EEG parameters Bispectral index (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA, version XP) and Narcotrend index (MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany, version 4.0) were used as measures of the pharmacodynamic effect.
With IRB approval and informed consent we analyzed the data of three studies including 61 adult patients scheduled for radical prostatectomies. At least 45 min after induction of general anesthesia, end-tidal concentrations of desflurane, sevoflurane or isoflurane were varied between 0.5 and 2 MAC. We transferred the end-tidal concentrations into age-related MAC values. The relationship between MAC effect compartment concentrations and EEG was modeled with a variation of the classical fractional sigmoid E(max) model with two linked sigmoidal curves. All parameters were calculated as a population fit by NONMEM V (GloboMax, Hanover, USA) by minimizing log likelihood.
The k(e0) values of the population fit derived from BIS data were 0.54 min(-1) for desflurane, 0.24 min(-1) for sevoflurane and 0.16 min(-1) for isoflurane, from the Narcotrend index 0.43 min(-1) for desflurane, 0.26 min(-1) for sevoflurane and 0.18 min(-1) for isoflurane. The change between the first and the second sigmoidal curve was positioned at nearly the same Narcotrend- and BIS index values between 41 and 44.

Because clinical assessment of depth of sedation is labor-intensive, performed only intermittently, and interferes with sedation and sleep, processed electrophysiological signals from the brain have gained interest as surrogates. We hypothesized that auditory event-related potentials (ERPs), Bispectral Index (BIS), and Entropy can discriminate among clinically relevant sedation levels.
We studied 10 patients after elective thoracic or abdominal surgery with general anesthesia. Electroencephalogram, BIS, state entropy (SE), response entropy (RE), and ERPs were recorded immediately after surgery in the intensive care unit at Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores of -5 (very deep sedation), -4 (deep sedation), -3 to -1 (moderate sedation), and 0 (awake) during decreasing target-controlled sedation with propofol and remifentanil. Reference measurements for baseline levels were performed before or several days after the operation.
At baseline, RASS -5, RASS -4, RASS -3 to -1, and RASS 0, BIS was 94 [4] (median, IQR), 47 [15], 68 [9], 75 [10], and 88 [6]; SE was 87 [3], 46 [10], 60 [22], 74 [21], and 87 [5]; and RE was 97 [4], 48 [9], 71 [25], 81 [18], and 96 [3], respectively (all P < 0.05, Friedman Test). Both BIS and Entropy had high variabilities. When ERP N100 amplitudes were considered alone, ERPs did not differ significantly among sedation levels. Nevertheless, discriminant ERP analysis including two parameters of principal component analysis revealed a prediction probability PK value of 0.89 for differentiating deep sedation, moderate sedation, and awake state. The corresponding PK for RE, SE, and BIS was 0.88, 0.89, and 0.85, respectively.
Neither ERPs nor BIS or Entropy can replace clinical sedation assessment with standard scoring systems. Discrimination among very deep, deep to moderate, and no sedation after general anesthesia can be provided by ERPs and processed electroencephalograms, with similar P(K)s. The high inter- and intraindividual variability of Entropy and BIS precludes defining a target range of values to predict the sedation level in critically ill patients using these parameters. The variability of ERPs is unknown.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19690250/

This study aimed at investigating the relationship between changes in BIS values during natural sleep and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) variations, as measured by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Data were obtained from six young, healthy, right-handed, male volunteers (20-30 years old) using the H2(15)O infusion method. PET scans were performed both during waking and various stages of sleep. BIS values were monitored continuously and recorded during each PET scan. Positive correlations were detected between BIS and rCBF values in dorsolateral prefontal, parietal, anterior and posterior cingulate, precuneal, mesiofrontal, mesiotemporal and insular cortices. These areas belong to a frontoparietal network known to be related to awareness of self conscious sensory perception, attention and memory. BIS values also positively correlated with activity in brainstem and thalami, both structures known to be involved in arousal and wakefulness. These results show that BIS changes associated with physiological sleep depth co-vary with the activity of specific cortical and subcortical areas. The latter are known to modulate arousal, which in turn allows sustained thalamo-cortical enhancement of activity in a specific frontoparietal network known to be related to the content of consciousness. Thus, although mainly derived from frontal EEG, BIS could represent a wider index of cerebral activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19678596/

All currently available monitors need varying time periods to calculate a new index when reacting to changes in anaesthetic depth. The exact time delay for calculation of new index values is unknown. In a previous study, we used simulated EEG signals and found considerable time lags for the cerebral state index (Danmeter, Odense, Denmark), the bispectral index (Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Newton, MA, USA), and the Narcotrend index (MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the time delays observed with simulated EEG signals also applied to real EEG data.
We used perioperatively recorded EEG data from a database corresponding to the awake state, general anaesthesia, and suppression of cortical activity, respectively. After a switch from one state of consciousness to another, the time necessary for all indices to adjust the index value to the underlying input signal was measured.
We found time delays for all indices between 24 (7) and 122 (23) s before the new state was indicated. In accordance with our previous results, these time delays were not constant and depended on the particular starting and target index value. Results were different for decreasing and increasing values.
Our results may show a limitation of the value of electronic EEG indices in prevention of awareness with recall. Furthermore, due to different time delays for ascending and descending values, the results of pharmacodynamic studies may be influenced by this phenomenon.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19648154/

Spikes were readily detected on the electroencephalogram on the bispectral index monitor, and the frequency of their occurrence increased or decreased in response to adjustment of the sevoflurane concentration. The disappearance of synchronisation between the left and the right hemispheres was observed with use of the bispectral index - in concordance with the electrocorticogram.

Twenty-five critically ill, unconscious patients with ischemic-hypoxic brain injury undergoing emergency surgery were prospectively studied. Clinical evaluation, laboratory investigations, BIS, and burst suppression ratio were recorded before and during surgery. Neurologic outcome of the patients was measured according to the Glasgow outcome scale at 30 days after injury, with poor neurologic outcome defined as severe disability or death.
The incidence of poor neurologic outcome was 68%. Neither clinical judgment (P = 0.40) nor pupillary responses (P = 0.21) were predictive of neurologic outcome after surgery. An abnormal BIS trace was strongly associated with poor neurologic outcome, positive likelihood ratio 6.6 (95% CI 1.7-36.4; exact test P = 0.002). Some BIS values were significantly different when comparing patients with and without poor outcome: c-statistics for the average BIS and maximal electroencephalographic burst-suppression were 0.80 (95% CI 0.62-0.98; P = 0.017) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.68-0.99; P = 0.007), respectively. A normal BIS (P < 0.0005) but not clinical judgment (P = 0.16) could identify a group of patients more likely to survive with a good neurologic outcome.

However, few studies have evaluated the impact of these alterations on postoperative pharmacodynamics. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that changes in propofol pharmacokinetics increase hypnotic effects after cardiopulmonary bypass.
Twenty patients scheduled for on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (group, n=10) or off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (group, n=10) coronary artery bypass grafts were anesthetized with sufentanil and a propofol target controlled infusion (2.0 microg/mL). Depth of hypnosis was monitored using the bispectral index. Blood samples were collected from the induction of anesthesia up to 12 hours after the end of propofol infusion, at predetermined intervals. Plasma propofol concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by a non-compartmental propofol pharmacokinetic analysis. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, considering p<0.05 as significant.
After cardiopulmonary bypass, despite similar plasma propofol concentrations in both groups, bispectral index values were lower in the on-pump coronary artery bypass graft group. Time to extubation after the end of propofol infusion was greater in the on-pump coronary artery bypass graft group (334 +/- 117 vs. 216 +/- 85 min, p = 0.04).

Thirty adult patients undergoing spine surgery were randomized to receive halothane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane, in 2 stages, (a) with air/oxygen mixture (2:1) and (b) in nitrous oxide/oxygen (2:1). Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, response entropy (RE), and state entropy (SE) were noted at 1.0 and 1.5 MACs for each agent. Statistical analysis was done using the 2-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni correction and Student t test for paired data. P value of less than 0.05 were considered significant. The demographics and baseline values of heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, RE, and SE were comparable. Changing from air/oxygen as carrier gas to 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen resulted in significant increase in both RE and SE at 1.0 MAC for all the agents (P<0.05). Among the agents, it was found that both RE and SE values were significantly higher during halothane anesthesia as compared with sevoflurane and isoflurane (P<0.05). At 1.5 MAC for all agents, after addition of nitrous oxide, there was an insignificant reduction in both RE and SE (P>0.05).

All intubated patients who received sedatives and/or paralytics to facilitate transport were eligible for enrollment by the attending clinician. Prior to liftoff, a BIS sensor was applied to the patient's forehead. Minimum, maximum, and mean BIS index scores were recorded every minute during transport. Results. Forty-seven patients (57% male) were enrolled, with a median age of 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 18-81, range 14 to 86 years). The median duration of monitoring was 15.0- minutes (IQR 6.0-26.0, range 2 to 33). The median BIS score was 54.6 (IQR 38.6-67.3, range 28 to 89.5). Only two patients (4.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5% to 14.8%) had at least one BIS score greater than 85, the accepted threshold for recall. Conclusion. These results suggest that patients are adequately sedated during air medical transport.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19291556/

Entropy is similar to the BIS monitor, as both process raw EEG to derive a number. We hypothesized that entropy may also be anesthetic agent-specific. Thirty adult patients undergoing spinal surgery were randomized to receive halothane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane. Entropy indices were recorded at various minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) values-0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 1.5-both during wash-in and wash-out of the agent. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), response entropy (RE), and state entropy (SE) were noted. Statistical analysis was done using a one-way analysis-ofvariance test. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Ten patients in each group completed the study. The demographics and baseline values of HR, MAP, RE, and SE were comparable in all three groups. During the study period, for a given MAC value, both RE and SE remained low in the isoflurane and sevoflurane groups compared to the halothane group. For a given MAC, the RE and SE were comparable during wash-in and wash-out phases. Halothane produced higher entropy values as compared to isoflurane and sevoflurane at equivalent MAC levels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19234845/

Annual International Conference,2008,"Jensen EW, Jospin M, Gambus PL, Vallverdu M, Caminal P","The level of consciousness of patients undergoing surgery evolves continuously as the effect of the anesthetic agents is counteracted by the surgical stimuli. The monitors of depth of anesthesia, based on the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), have been progressively introduced into the daily practice to provide additional information about the state of the patient. In this work, the Index of Consciousness (IoC), a recent index which uses the information from EEG spectrum and symbolic dynamics through a fuzzy inference system, is introduced. The bispectral index BIS, a well-established index, is used to validate the IoC. A good correlation is found between both indexes. Furthermore, IoC presents a significantly higher prediction probability Pk of the level of sedation than BIS, and can thus be considered as an interesting measure of the level of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19163975/

In this situation continuous EEG offers a convenient, effective method of monitoring the depth of sedation, using spectral edge frequency (SEF) to quantify EEG activity. The authors report 3 patients with severe Guillain-Barré syndrome managed with sedation aimed at a SEF95 below 4.0 Hz (delta coma), using a subhairline montage with the DATEX bedside EEG module. Two of the patients were easily managed using this system for an average of 16 days, and both were completely amnestic of this period of time with no serious complication. The third one had still some residual muscle activity and SEF was unreliable in this case, so its use was abandoned. Continuous EEG monitoring using SEF is a useful tool to manage sedation in the most severely paralyzed Guillain-Barré syndrome patients. Incorporation of a low-pass filter would be of benefit to remove any residual muscle activity, which confounds the target level of sedation with this method; SEF has theoretical advantages over the bispectral index in this population.

However, there are suggestions that EEG derived anesthesia depth monitors have inferior performance in infants. The aim of this study was to quantify the degree of sedation during spinal anesthesia in infants using another EEG derived measure of anesthesia effect--the Cerebral State Index (CSI).
Twelve infants, <52 weeks postconceptual menstrual age, scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair under spinal anesthesia were enrolled. Patients received a standard anesthetic protocol with a subarachnoid dose of 1 mg x kg(-1) of levobupivacaine 0.5%. No premedication, sedatives, opioids or anticholinergics were administrated during the perioperative period and patients were left undisturbed during the surgical time, without tactile stimulation or loud auditory stimuli. CSI score (0-100) and bust suppression (BS) (0-100%) were continuously recorded during the surgical time and then statistically re-evaluated.
In all patients the CSI fell during the procedure and there were significant levels of BS recorded by the CSI monitor. The BS occurred between 12 and 34 min after spinal anesthesia with the peak being at 30 min and mean onset time being 15 (2.6) min after spinal block. A statistical significant difference was found between the lowest mean CSI as well as the highest BS if compared with their baseline values. A negative correlation was found between CSI and BS.
The degree of burst suppression detected by the CSI in our study supports the hypothesis that infants may have discontinuous patterns of EEG during spinal anesthesia similar to those seen during emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, the limitations in the application of the adult algorithms to infant EEG may lead to an overestimation of the degree of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19143957/

The objective of this study was to determine whether DSIP could be used as an adjunct to volatile anaesthesia in humans, our hypothesis being that DSIP is a natural hypnotic that would increase anaesthetic depth. The aims were to assess depth of anaesthesia using bispectral index (BIS), the EEG and heart rate variability (HRV), and to determine whether DSIP altered the symmetry of EEG between the left and right cerebral hemispheres.
Twenty-four female ASA I or II patients gave written, informed consent to a protocol approved by our local research ethics committee. Twelve were randomly assigned as controls to receive saline. The other 12 were randomly allocated to receive one of three intravenous bolus doses of DSIP (Clinalfa) at 25, 50 or 100 nmol kg(-1). The first administration of DSIP was while awake and the second after induction of anaesthesia with propofol and maintenance with isoflurane. BIS and EEG parameters were measured continuously using a bilateral electrode montage.
DSIP significantly increased heart rate, decreased HRV and, paradoxically, significantly reduced delta rhythm along with reducing burst suppression and increasing BIS at 25 nmol kg(-1) during isoflurane anaesthesia. DSIP also significantly altered bilateral symmetry of EEG.
DSIP probably reduced parasympathetic tone and decreased (lightened) the depth of anaesthesia measured using BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19142086/

The presence of burst suppression, a pattern of severely decreased brain wave activity on the electroencephalogram, may be unintentionally induced by heavy doses of sedatives. Burst suppression has never been studied as a potential risk factor for death in patients without a known neurologic disorder or injury.
Post hoc analysis of a prospectively observational cohort study.
Medical intensive care units of a tertiary care, university-based medical center.
A total of 125 mechanically ventilated, adult, critically ill patients.
A validated arousal scale (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) was used to measure sedation level, and the bispectral index monitor was used to capture electroencephalogram data. Burst suppression occurred in 49 of 125 patients (39%). For analysis, the patients were divided into those with burst suppression (49 of 125, 39%) and those without burst suppression (76 of 125, 61%). All baseline variables were similar between the two groups, with the overall cohort demonstrating a high severity of illness (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores of 27.4 +/- 8.2) and 98% receiving sedation. Of those with burst suppression, 29 of 49 (59%) died within 6 months compared with 25 of 76 (33%) who did not demonstrate burst suppression. Using time-dependent Cox regression to adjust for clinically important covariates (age, Charlson comorbidity score, baseline dementia, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, coma, and delirium), patients who experienced burst suppression were found to have a statistically significant higher 6-month mortality [Hazard's ratio = 2.04, 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.70, p = 0.02].

The Bispectral Index (BIS) is derived from EEG and considers cortical silence. We sought to determine whether a BIS range could predict a specific burst-suppression pattern.
Eleven TBI patients treated with barbiturate were included prospectively. EEG was recorded daily for 1 h. Every 5 min, the number of bursts and the suppression ratio (suppression ratio from EEG [SR(EEG)]: percentage of last 60 s in cortical silence) was calculated for 1 min on the raw EEG and compared to concomitant data from the BIS-XP (BIS and suppression ratio [SR(BIS)]). The optimal level of barbiturate coma was defined as 2-5 bursts/min in the EEG. A BIS range predictive of optimal level was determined from all data and its accuracy was studied for each examination.
Agreement between SR(EEG) and SR(BIS) was high (interclass correlation coefficient 0.94 [95% confidence interval: 0.90-0.96]). There was a significant association between SR(EEG) and BIS. Significant disagreements were observed in some examinations. The best accuracy to predict optimal pattern was obtained with a BIS range from 6 to 15.
The relationship between BIS and SR(EEG) was high in TBI patients treated with barbiturates. The rate of barbiturate infusion might be decreased if BIS is <6 or increased if BIS is >15.

We sought to quantify and compare the dynamic profile of sevoflurane's effect measured with the cerebral state index (CSI) and the bispectral index (BIS) in children.
Fifteen healthy children, aged 3-15 yr, scheduled to undergo minor surgery were prospectively studied. During the simultaneous recording of CSI and BIS, the sevoflurane vaporizer was set at 6 vol % for 5 min and then decreased. End-tidal concentrations (C(ET)) were measured. The C(ET)-sevoflurane effect-site concentration equilibration and pharmacodynamics were modeled. Goodness of fit between models was compared. Data are typical value (coefficient of variation).
Within the anesthetic depth range studied, the rate of change of sevoflurane's effect expressed as the effect-site equilibration half-life (t(1/2) k(e0)) was slower with the CSI [2.0 (14) min] than with BIS [1.2 (53) min] (P < 0.05). The estimated baseline effect of BIS and CSI before sevoflurane administration (E(0)) was 84 (39) for CSI and 87 (7) for BIS (NS). The sensitivity to sevoflurane hypnotic effect expressed in the C(50) [steady-state C(ET) eliciting half of the maximum response (E(max))] was 2.1 (68) % with CSI and 2.1 (16)% with BIS (NS).

The objective of this investigation was to develop consensus for such criteria regarding the identification of three ventilatory events: disconnection or significant leak in the anesthesia circuit, decreased lung compliance or increased resistance, and anesthetic overdose from inhaled anesthetics.
We individually administered a structured interview to five expert anesthesiologists to gain insight into the cognitive processes used by clinicians to diagnose ventilatory events and to determine the common heuristics (rules of thumb) used in clinical practice. We then used common themes, identified from analysis of the structured interviews, to generate questions for a series of web-based questionnaires. Using a modified Delphi technique, iterative questionnaire administration facilitated rapid consensus development on the thresholds for the specific rules used to identify ventilatory events.
A threshold for 75% agreement was described for each scenario in a healthy ventilated adult. A disconnection or significant leak in the anesthesia circuit is diagnosed with peak airway pressure (< 5 cm H2O or change of 15 cm H2O), ETCO2 (0 mmHg, 40% drop, or value below 10 mmHg for a duration of 20 sec), and inspired-expired volume difference (300 mL). Increased resistance or decreased lung compliance is diagnosed with high peak airway pressure (40 cm H2O or a 20 cm H2O change), asymmetry of capnogram, and changes in measured compliance or resistance. Anesthetic overdose from inhaled anesthetics is diagnosed with high end-tidal anesthetic agent concentration (2 MAC in a patient less than 60 yr of age or 1.75 MAC in a patient over 60 yr of age), low systolic blood pressure (below 60 mmHg), and low modified electroencephalogram (bispectral index or entropy).

Data were obtained from 20 consecutive patients undergoing thoracic surgery and necessitating SLV of more than 1 h. The FORESIGHTtrade mark (CASMED, USA) absolute oximeter was used to measure left, right, and average absolute Sct(o(2)) every 5 min from the awake state to extubation. Bispectral index and standard monitoring parameters were also recorded every 5 min. Blood gas analysis was performed every 15 min. Data median (IQR) (range) were analysed using repeated-measures anova and Spearman's correlation test, P<0.05.
Patients [median age 65 yr (range 46-75)] showed an absolute Sct(o(2)) of 80% (78, 82) (74-87) in the awake state, which decreased to a minimum Sct(o(2)) value of 63% (57, 65) (53-73) during SLV to recover to an Sct(o(2)) of 71% immediately after extubation. During SLV, all patients had a decrease of more than 15% of the initial Sct(o(2)) and 70% of patients had a decrease of more than 20%. The decrease in Sct(o(2)) was not correlated with any standard clinical parameters, for example, arterial pressure, blood loss, peripheral oxygen saturation, or Pa(o(2)).
Thoracic surgery with SLV seems to be associated with a significant decrease of Sct(o(2)) in the majority of patients.

Their overuse may prolong mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the intensive care unit. Guidelines recommend use of sedation protocols that include sedation scores and trials of sedation cessation to minimize drug use. We evaluated processed electroencephalography (response and state entropy and bispectral index) as an adjunct to monitoring effects of commonly used sedative and analgesic drugs and intratracheal suctioning.
Electrodes for monitoring bispectral index and entropy were placed on the foreheads of 44 critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation and who previously had no brain dysfunction. Sedation was targeted individually using the Ramsay Sedation Scale, recorded every 2 hours or more frequently. Use of and indications for sedative and analgesic drugs and intratracheal suctioning were recorded manually and using a camera. At the end of the study, processed electroencephalographical and haemodynamic variables collected before and after each drug application and tracheal suctioning were analyzed. Ramsay score was used for comparison with processed electroencephalography when assessed within 15 minutes of an intervention.
The indications for boli of sedative drugs exhibited statistically significant, albeit clinically irrelevant, differences in terms of their association with processed electroencephalographical parameters. Electroencephalographical variables decreased significantly after bolus, but a specific pattern in electroencephalographical variables before drug administration was not identified. The same was true for opiate administration. At both 30 minutes and 2 minutes before intratracheal suctioning, there was no difference in electroencephalographical or clinical signs in patients who had or had not received drugs 10 minutes before suctioning. Among patients who received drugs, electroencephalographical parameters returned to baseline more rapidly. In those cases in which Ramsay score was assessed before the event, processed electroencephalography exhibited high variation.
Unpleasant or painful stimuli and sedative and analgesic drugs are associated with significant changes in processed electroencephalographical parameters. However, clinical indications for drug administration were not reflected by these electroencephalographical parameters, and barely by sedation level before drug administration or tracheal suction. This precludes incorporation of entropy and bispectral index as target variables for sedation and analgesia protocols in critically ill patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18796156/

Twenty-two patients were anaesthetized using sevoflurane 1.5% combined with remifentanil or epidural anaesthesia. After a stable normocapnic period, hypocapnia was induced by hyperventilation, and the raw EEG signals were collected. Bispectral analysis (bicoherence) and power spectrum analysis were performed before and after hypocapnia.
Mean (sd) peak bicoherence in the delta- area increased from 35.6 (10.9)% during normocapnia to 43.8 (10.9)% during hypocapnia (P<0.05), whereas mean (sd) peak bicoherence in the alpha area decreased from 42.8 (14.4)% during normocapnia to 37.5 (12.3)% during hypocapnia (P<0.05). Normalized power in the delta- frequencies on the power spectrum increased from 60.2 (13.1)% to 72.5 (12.7)% (P<0.05).

The primary aim of our observational study was to assess the difference in BIS values between the left and right sides of the brain. Secondary aims were to compare BIS and COMFORT score and to assess change in BIS with tracheal suctioning.
Nineteen ventilated and sedated PICU patients had paediatric BIS sensors applied to either side of their forehead. Each patient underwent physiotherapy involving tracheal suctioning. Their BIS data and corresponding COMFORT score, assessment as by their respective nurses, were recorded before, during, and after physiotherapy.
Seven patients underwent more than one physiotherapy session; therefore, 28 sets of data were collected. The mean BIS difference values (and 95% CI) between left BIS and right BIS for pre-, during, and post-physiotherapy periods were 9.2 (5.9-12.5), 15.8 (11.9-19.7), and 7.5 (5.2-9.7), respectively. Correlation between mean BIS, left brain BIS, and right brain BIS to COMFORT score was highly significant (P<0.001 for all three) during the pre- and post-physiotherapy period, but less so during the stimulated physiotherapy period (P=0.044, P=0.014, and P=0.253, respectively).

The patient was a 77-year-old male who had congestive heart failure as a result of severe mitral regurgitation. Mitral valve repair was performed without aortic cross-clamping, using moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Aortic regurgitation was likely to worsen upon retracting the atrial septum to expose the mitral valve, complicating the operative procedure. We therefore controlled the regurgitation by lowering the blood temperature and using systemic perfusion flow. During systemic low-flow perfusion, we used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and the bispectral index to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion. The tissue oxygenation index value derived from NIRS was maintained above 55% during the procedure. The repair was performed safely with no difficulty. The postoperative course was satisfactory, with no neurological complications; echocardiography revealed no mitral regurgitation.

In animal investigations, cerebral metabolic rate (CMR) was unchanged. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that dexmedetomidine would cause a decrease in the CBF/CMR ratio with even further reduction by superimposed hyperventilation. This reduction might be deleterious in patients with neurologic injuries.
Middle cerebral artery velocity (CBFV) was recorded continuously in six volunteers. CBFV, jugular bulb venous saturation (Sjvo2), CMR equivalent (CMRe), and CBFV/CMRe ratio were determined at six intervals before, during, and after administration of dexmedetomidine: (1) presedation; (2) presedation with hyperventilation; at steady state plasma levels of (3) 0.6 ng/ml and (4) 1.2 ng/ml; (5) 1.2 ng/ml with hyperventilation; and (6) 30 min after discontinuing dexmedetomidine. The slope of the arterial carbon dioxide tension (Paco2)-CBFV relation was determined presedation and at 1.2 ng/ml.
CBFV and CMRe decreased in a dose-related manner. The CBFV/CMRe ratio was unchanged. The CBFV response to carbon dioxide decreased from 1.20 +/- 0.2 cm.s.mm Hg presedation to 0.40 +/- 0.15 cm.s.mm Hg at 1.2 ng/ml. Sjvo2 was statistically unchanged during hyperventilation at 1.2 ng/ml versus presedation (50 +/- 11 vs. 43 +/- 5%). Arousal for hyperventilation at 1.2 ng/ml resulted in increased CBFV (30 +/- 5 to 38 +/- 4) and Bispectral Index (43 +/- 10 to 94 +/- 3).
The predicted decrease in CBFV/CMRe ratio was not observed because of an unanticipated reduction of CMRe and a decrease in the slope of the Paco2-CBFV relation. CBFV and Bispectral Index increases during arousal for hyperventilation at 1.2 ng/ml suggest that CMR-CBF coupling is preserved during dexmedetomidine administration. Further evaluation of dexmedetomidine in patients with neurologic injuries seems justified.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18212567/

The performance of BIS, State Entropy, and Response Entropy were evaluated with prediction probability, sensitivity, and specificity analyses. The power spectrum of the raw electroencephalogram signal was calculated.
The mean (SD) xenon concentration during anesthesia was 66.4% (2.4%). BIS, State Entropy, and Response Entropy demonstrated low prediction probability values at loss of response (0.455, 0.656, and 0.619) but 1 min after that the values were high (0.804, 0.941, and 0.929).

Barbiturates are used to lower intracranial pressure or to stop epileptiform activity, with the aim being to improve neurological outcome. Dosing of barbiturates is usually guided by the extent of induced burst-suppression pattern on the electroencephalogram (EEG). Dosing beyond the point of burst suppression may increase the risk for complications without offering further therapeutic benefit. For this reason, careful monitoring of EEG parameters is mandatory. A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of the bispectral index suppression ratio for monitoring barbiturate coma.
A prospective observational pilot study was performed at a paediatric (surgical) intensive care unit, including all children with barbiturate-induced coma after traumatic brain injury or GCSE. The BIS (Bispectral index) monitor expresses a suppression ratio, which represents the percentage of epochs per minute in which the EEG was suppressed. Suppression ratios from the BIS monitor were compared with suppression ratios of full-channel EEG as assessed by quantitative visual analysis.
Five patients with GCSE and three patients after traumatic brain injury (median age 11.6 years, range 4 months to 15 years) were included. In four patients the correlation between the suppression ratios of the BIS and EEG could be determined; the average correlation was 0.68. In two patients, suppression ratios were either high or low, with no intermediate values. This precluded determination of correlation values, as did the isoelectric EEG in a further two patients. In the latter patients, the mean +/- standard error BIS suppression ratio was 95 +/- 1.6.
Correlations between suppression ratios of the BIS and EEG were found to be only moderate. In particular, asymmetrical EEGs and EEGs with short bursts (less than 1 second) may result in aberrant BIS suppression ratios. The BIS monitor potentially aids monitoring of barbiturate-induced coma because it provides continuous data on EEG suppression between full EEG registrations, but it should be used with caution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17897479/

Twenty patients were anesthetized with sevoflurane, titrated for 30 min to an end-tidal concentration of 1.2% (baseline). Rocuronium was infused to 50% (partial) and 95% (profound) depression of the first twitch in a train-of-four response, the order being randomly chosen. Noxious tetanic electrical stimulation was applied at four occasions: 1) at baseline (control measurement), 2 and 3) at each degree of NMB, and 4) after neostigmine reversal. BIS, AAI, and EMG were obtained 2 min before and 2 min after each noxious stimulation.
Median BIS and AAI at baseline were 44 (39-50) and 15 (14-16), respectively. The two degrees of NMB did not affect BIS, AAI, and EMG before noxious stimulation.

17592349,Quantification of burst suppression and bispectral index with 2 different bolus doses of thiopentone sodium.,Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,2007,"Ramesh VJ, Umamaheswara Rao GS","Metabolic suppression caused by barbiturates is a major mechanism responsible for their cerebral protective potential. Maximal cerebral metabolic suppression is believed to coincide with electroencephalographic burst suppression. However, many neurosurgical procedures associated with cerebral ischemic threat are still performed in the absence of electroencephalogram monitoring, especially in developing nations. The present study was designed to assess the degree of burst suppression with 2 different doses of thiopentone sodium administered on the background of isoflurane anesthesia intraoperatively. Forty-one patients without any intracranial pathology undergoing elective spinal surgery under a general anesthetic consisting of N2O (60%) in O2 (40%) and isoflurane to maintain a bispectral index (BIS) value of 45 were randomized to receive a thiopentone bolus of either 3 or 5 mg/kg. BIS, burst suppression ratio (BSR), systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded before the bolus and every 15 seconds for first 2 minutes and every 30 seconds for another 8 minutes. During the 10-minute study period after the administration of thiopentone bolus, BIS values were significantly lower in the group that received thiopentone 5 mg/kg compared with the group that received thiopentone 3 mg/kg (P<0.02). BSR>25% was seen in 7 out of 21 patients in the 3 mg/kg group and 10 out of 20 patients in the 5 mg/kg group. There was a statistically insignificant prolongation of the duration of burst suppression with thiopentone 5 mg/kg [243 s (range 75 to 435 s)] compared with thiopentone 3 mg/kg [171 s (30 to 465 s)]. The number of patients who had a BSR >50% was higher among patients who received thiopentone 5 mg/kg as compared with those who received a dose of 3 mg/kg [9/20 vs. 3/21(P<0.02)]. We conclude that thiopentone in a bolus dose of 3 to 5 mg/kg produces only a short duration of incomplete burst suppression. Also, in this dose range, burst suppression does not occur consistently in all patients. The present data suggest that bolus doses of thiopentone in the range of 3 to 5 mg/kg may have very limited value in providing significant metabolic suppression required for intraoperative cerebral protection during temporary ischemic episodes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17592349/

The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to examine the characteristics of the time to peak effect (T(PEAK)) of propofol, a pharmacokinetic-independent descriptor of blood-brain equilibration, and k(e0) derived from T(PEAK) with A-line auditory-evoked potential monitor and Aspect A-2000 bispectral index monitor in Chinese patients.
Two-hundred ASA I patients received a submaximal bolus dose of propofol (1.5 mg kg(-1)). T(PEAK) was randomly measured by means of the A-line auditory-evoked potential monitor (Group AAI (auditory-evoked potential index), n = 100) or the Aspect A-2000 bispectral index monitor (Group BIS, n = 100). Using T(PEAK) and four previously validated pharmacokinetic parameter sets of propofol, the k(e0) was estimated according to a method proposed recently.
The mean T(PEAK) was 145 +/- 35 s (50-224 s) and 74+/-24 s (38-143 s) in Groups AAI and BIS, respectively (P < 0.01 between groups). There were no correlations between the patient's age and T(PEAK)s (r = 0.147 and 0.031 for Groups AAI and BIS). The median k(e0) in Group AAI was 0.64 min(-1) with the model of Marsh, 0.17 min(-1) with the Schnider model, 0.78 min(-1) with the Tackley model and 0.93 min(-1) with the Shafer model.

The T(PEAK) of propofol measured by the A-line auditory-evoked potential monitor is different from that measured by the Aspect A-2000 bispectral index monitor. The T(PEAK)s of propofol from auditory-evoked potential index and bispectral index, and the values of k(e0) calculated based on T(PEAK)s are different from previous reports and appear to be not affected by age.

We simultaneously analysed the effects of sevoflurane (Group S; n = 18) or propofol (Group P; n = 29) on the bispectral index (BIS) and the first component of the blink reflex (R1). The dose of anaesthetic agent was increased until loss of blink reflex. After discontinuation and reappearance of blink reflex activity, the amount was increased again. The area under curve R1 (area-R1) of the electromyogram of the orbicularis oculi muscle after electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve was measured. Using a sigmoid E(max) model and a first-order rate constant k(e0), we characterized the dose-response relationships for BIS and area-R1.
Concentration-dependent depression of BIS and area-R1 was adequately modelled. The concentration that causes an effect midway between minimum and maximum (EC50) for area-R1 was smaller than EC50 for BIS in both groups [0.34 (0.19) vs 1.29 (0.19) vol% and 1.78 (0.65) vs 2.69 (0.67) mug ml(-1); mean (sd)]. At doses of sevoflurane and propofol with equivalent depression of BIS, sevoflurane depressed area-R1 more than propofol. The k(e0) for area-R1 was about half that for BIS in both groups: 0.24 (0.19-0.29) vs 0.48 (0.38-0.60) min(-1) for Group S; 0.28 (0.23-0.34) vs 0.46 (0.40-0.54) min(-1) for Group P, geometric mean (95% CI).
The blink reflex (brainstem function) is more sensitive to sevoflurane or propofol than BIS (forebrain function). Sevoflurane suppresses the blink reflex more than propofol. Different k(e0)s for blink reflex vs BIS indicate different effect sites.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17519261/

During the implantation procedure for the electrodes, the patient emerges from anesthesia repeatedly to facilitate neurological testing. We investigated whether Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring would be beneficial in patients receiving ""sleep-awake-sleep"" anesthesia with respect to time of arousal, consumption of propofol, and cardiopulmonary stability (i.e., heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and end-tidal carbon dioxide).
We investigated 21 patients scheduled for implantation of DBS electrodes. Depth of propofol anesthesia was controlled either with BIS guidance in 10 patients (BIS group) or without in 11 patients (non-BIS group). In the BIS group, a BIS score of 40-60 was targeted during sleep periods, whereas in the non-BIS group, a value of 1 (= no response to tactile stimulation [unconsciousness]) on the Observers' Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale was targeted. For analgesia, the sites for the burr holes and for the pins of the stereotactic ring were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine; no opioids were used. For periods during which an awake patient required neurological testing, propofol was discontinued.
We found no difference between groups with respect to times of arousal, total amount of propofol consumption, and cardiopulmonary stability. However, significantly more propofol boluses had to be administered in the BIS group (30 +/- 11.6 vs 17 +/- 4.6) to maintain the BIS score within the target range (P < 0.05).

Recently, bispectral index (BIS) derived from the frontal cortical electroencephalogram has been used frequently for quantifying the hypnotic component of anesthesia. The present study was designed to examine the BIS values produced by equi-MAC concentrations of halothane and isoflurane. In 34 patients undergoing spinal surgery, BIS and spectral edge frequency (SEF95) were recorded at 3 different concentrations of halothane and isoflurane--namely 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 MAC. The measurements were made both during wash-in and wash-out phases of the anesthetic agent. Eighteen patients received halothane and 16 received isoflurane. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, oxygen saturation, and end tidal carbon dioxide pressure values were not different between the 2 groups at various MAC concentrations of the anesthetic agents. BIS and SEF95 values decreased significantly with increasing concentrations of both the anesthetic agents (P<0.001). At any given MAC concentration of the anesthetic, BIS and SEF(95) values were significantly lower under isoflurane compared with halothane anesthesia both during wash-in and wash-out phases (P<0.001). For a given anesthetic agent, BIS values were comparable at equi-MAC concentrations during wash-in and wash-out phases. In conclusion, BIS values are significantly lower under isoflurane compared with halothane anesthesia at similar MAC concentrations. For a given anesthetic agent and a given MAC concentration, the BIS values are similar during wash-in and wash-out phases of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17413994/

We evaluated the influence of the extent of spinal block on BIS values and on regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) in elderly patients.
A prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was performed in 55 ASA II patients undergoing urological surgery. The patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups to receive 2.7 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine or 1.5 ml, and then divided into two groups according to level of spinal blockade: high spinal group (Th6 and above) or low spinal group (Th12 and below). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), BIS values, and rSO(2) were measured for 30 min. CO and SV were evaluated using impedance cardiograph methods.
The level of spinal blockade was Th4.7 +/- 1.0 in high spinal group (n = 20) and L2.5 +/- 2.2 in low spinal group (n = 20). High spinal anesthesia produced a significant decrease in SBP (p < 0.01) and SV (p < 0.01), but had no effect on CO. High spinal anesthesia significantly decreased BIS values (p < 0.01) without affecting rSO(2). There was relationship between level of spinal blockade and BIS values (r = 0.566).

17198101,Bispectral index profile during carotid cross clamping.,Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,2007,"Bonhomme V, Desiron Q, Lemineur T, Brichant JF, Dewandre PY, Hans P","This study aimed at investigating the Bispectral Index (BIS) profile during carotid cross clamping (CXC). The study involved a pilot group of 10 patients undergoing routine carotid endarterectomy with shunt insertion under total intravenous anesthesia, and a study group of 26 additional patients. In all patients, rates of propofol and remifentanil providing a steady-state level of hypnosis (BIS: 40-60) were maintained constant throughout a recording period ranging from 3 minutes before CXC to shunt insertion. BIS was recorded throughout this period and the internal carotid backflow observed at the time of shunt insertion was graded as good, moderate, or poor. In addition, A-Line Autoregressive Index (AAI) and processed electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters were recorded in patients of the study group. All parameters were averaged over 1 minute before CXC, at CXC, 1, 2, and 3 minutes after CXC, and at shunt insertion. Statistical analysis was performed using chi2, Friedman, and Spearman correlation tests. For technical reasons, reliable AAI, BIS monitor-derived, and other processed EEG data were obtained in 24, 25, and 18 patients of the study group, respectively. During the first 3 minutes after CXC, BIS increased over 60 [68.8 (6.1)] in 47%, decreased below 40 [34.9 (4.4)] in 25%, and remained in the 40 to 60 range in 28% of all recruited patients. A BIS increase was more frequently observed in patients with moderate or poor than in those with good internal carotid backflow (78, 67, and 29%, respectively). It was significantly correlated to an increase in AAI and EEG amplitude, a decrease in EEG suppression ratio, and a shorter time between induction of anesthesia and CXC. A BIS decrease was significantly correlated to an increase in suppression ratio and a longer time between induction and CXC. In conclusion, during CXC under a constant level of intravenous anesthesia, BIS may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged. The paradoxical BIS increase could be related to borderline ischemia, a change in brain anesthetic agent concentration, or a change in the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance associated with a CXC-elicited painful stimulation. Caution should be used when interpreting BIS value during CXC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17198101/

There is no report on associations between genetic polymorphisms in ABCB1 and the clinical effects of fentanyl, although fentanyl may be a substrate of PGP. One hundred and twenty-six (126) unrelated Korean patients under spinal anesthesia with intravenous fentanyl (2.5 microg/kg) were recruited. Clinical effects (bispectral index, respiration rate, and need for oxygen supplementation) were monitored and these were compared between genotypes for three single nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCB1 (1236C>T, 2677G>T/A, and 3435C>T). The allele and genotype frequencies were similar to previous data from Asians; the three major haplotypes, TTT (30%), TGC (24%), and CGC (24%) were expected among nine known haplotypes. During the initial 10 min, there were differences in suppression of respiration rate by fentanyl among the three genotypes (P=0.0933 for 1236C>T; P=0.0941 for 2677G>A/T; P=0.0013 for 3435C>T, repeated-measures analysis of variance), but the differences in bispectral index among genotypes were not observed. Furthermore, patients carrying the linked 3435T and 2677T alleles showed a significant difference in the level of respiratory suppression (P=0.0056); those with genotypes susceptible to fentanyl (1236TT, 2677TT, and 3435TT) showed early (2-3 min) and profound suppression of respiration (65-73% of initial respiration rate) compared with other resistant genotypes (83-85% of initial respiration rate in 1236CC, 2677GG, and 3435CC). Although the need to supply oxygen was not significantly different between genotypes, there was a trend for increased demand by patients carrying both 1236T and 3435T alleles (P=0.0847). In conclusion, our results confirm ABCB1 genotype data for Koreans and suggest that analysis of ABCB1 polymorphisms may have clinical relevance to prevent respiratory suppression by intravenous fentanyl or to anticipate its clinical effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17192767/

This is a prospective observational study. Values of intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), BIS, and StcO2 were recorded hourly for the first six, post-injury days in 18 patients with severe brain injury. Included in the analyses was the Cranial-Arterial Pressure (CAP) Index, which is ICP/(MAP-ICP).
After 1,883 hours of data were analyzed, we found that StcO2 and BIS are associated with survival, good neurological outcome, ICP </=20, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) > or =60, and CAP index < or =0.30 (p < or = 0.001). Survival and good outcome are independently associated with BIS > or =60, StcO2 > or =70, and ICP < or =20 (p < 0.0001). BIS > or =60 or StcO2 > or =70 is associated with survival, good outcome, CPP > or =60, ICP < or =20, CAP index < or =0.30, and fewer ICP interventions (p < 0.0001). With BIS > or =60 or StcO2 > or =70, the rate of CPP > or =60 is 97.2% and the rate of ICP< or = 25 is 97.1%. An increased CAP index is associated with death, poor neurological outcome, and increased ICP interventions (p < 0.0001). With CAP index >0.25, MAP is not related to ICP (p = 0.16).
Numerous significant associations with ICU outcomes indicate that BIS and StcO2 are clinically relevant. The independent associations of BIS, StcO2, and ICP with outcomes suggest that noninvasive multi-modal monitoring may be beneficial. Future studies of patients with BIS > or =60 or StcO2 > or =70 will determine if select patients can be managed without ICP monitoring and whether marginal ICP can be observed.

State entropy differed significantly from 0 (isoelectric EEG) 28%, response entropy 29%, and BIS 68% of the total recorded time. The median values during the operation were state entropy 0.0, response entropy 0.0, and BIS 3.0. In four of 16 organ donors studied the EEG was not isoelectric, and nonreactive rhythmic activity was noted in time-domain EEG. After excluding the results from subjects with persistent residual EEG activity state entropy, response entropy, and BIS values differed from zero 17%, 18%, and 62% of the recorded time, respectively. Median values were 0.0, 0.0, and 2.0 for state entropy, response entropy, and BIS, respectively. The highest index values in entropy and BIS monitoring were recorded without neuromuscular blockade. The main sources of artifacts were electrocauterization, 50-Hz artifact, handling of the donor, ballistocardiography, electromyography, and electrocardiography.
Both entropy and BIS showed nonzero values due to artifacts after brain death diagnosis. BIS was more liable to artifacts than entropy.

Bispectral index (BIS) and middle-latency auditory-evoked potentials (Alaris AEP index, AAI) were reported to be accurate indicators for the level of sedation and loss of consciousness. We assessed these monitors during sedation with special emphasis on preventing over-sedation. One-hundred patients scheduled for elective eye surgery were sedated with target-controlled propofol infusion and randomly allocated to BIS-guided, AAI-guided, BIS/AAI-guided, or clinically guided groups (n = 25 each). The initial target concentration was 0.5 microg x mL(-1) in patients >70 yr and 1.0 microg x mL(-1) in all other patients. The concentration was increased every 3 min by 0.1 or 0.2 microg x mL(-1), respectively until the patient had reached a BIS value of 75 (range 70-90) or an AAI of 40 (range 35-60). The surgeon who was blinded to group allocation assessed treatment quality after the procedure. Sedation was converted into general anesthesia in four patients because of excessive head movements. BIS was out of range 7% of the time vs 58% for AAI. No significant differences in treatment quality were observed among the four groups. We conclude that propofol sedation, guided by BIS or AAI monitoring, did not enhance ophthalmic surgical operating conditions over sedation guided by clinical observation only.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17056953/

This study tested the hypothesis that sevoflurane affect BIS values, rSO(2), and the pharmacokinetics of propofol during propofol/ N(2)O anesthesia.
General anesthesia was administered to 15 ASA I-II patients with a continuous infusion of propofol to maintain a BIS value of 45 +/- 5. After recording baseline values, patients were assigned to receive sevoflurane (2.0%, 20 min). BIS values, rSO(2) using near-infrared spectroscopy, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded for 60 min. Cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) were evaluated using impedance cardiograph methods. Propofol concentration was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography.
Sevoflurane (2.0%, 20 min) decreased the BIS score from 47.4 +/- 8.2 to 27.3 +/- 5.9 (P < 0.01, n = 15) without affecting rSO(2). Sevoflurane decreased systolic blood pressure from 112.1 +/- 14.0 mmHg to 96.5 +/- 13.2 mmHg (P < 0.001, n = 15) without affecting heart rate. Both CO and SV were significantly decreased during sevoflurane application.

We have shown that sevoflurane decreases BIS values during propofol/N(2)O anesthesia without affecting rSO(2) and that this change is accompanied by an increase in serum propofol concentration. Changes in propofol concentration may be due to, at least in part, hemodynamic changes such as decreased CO produced by sevoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17006727/

Performing these confirmatory tests presents some drawbacks, such as high costs, the need for specialized personnel and technology, transportation of patients out of the intensive care unit, and the use of contrast media. Bispectral index monitoring can provide real-time, objective, continuous monitoring of the consciousness level in critically ill children.

After the diagnosis of brain death, at least 2-hour monitoring was performed, and all patients expressed a score of 0, indicating brain death. According to our study, the decrease in bispectral index score to 0 in patients with suspected brain death can support and confirm brain death diagnosis in children and can enable scheduling of expensive tests, such as cerebral angiography, in the appropriate time.

Recent evidence suggests that BIS may also help in the detection of cerebral ischemia and prognostication of outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study was designed to investigate the correlation between Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and BIS in mild and moderate head injury.
In 29 patients with mild (GCS 13-15) and moderate (GCS 9-12) head injuries who underwent craniotomy, GCS and BIS were measured before surgery, after surgery and once a day for the first 10 days.
A significant correlation was found between GCS and BIS in the data sets from all the patients (r = 0.67; p < 0.001). Mean BIS values increased with increasing GCS scores. However, the scatter of BIS values for any GCS score was high limiting the value of BIS in predicting GCS. Mean BIS values were significantly different between mild and moderate head injuries [65.7 +/- 16.1 vs. 85.7 +/- 6.1, p = 0.006].
In patients with mild and moderate head injury, significant correlation exists between GCS and BIS. But the high degree of scatter of BIS values for any given GCS score limits its use as a monitor of depth of coma in TBI.

Levels of sedation were assessed using the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (MOAAS). EEG-measurements were performed during wakefulness, deep propofol sedation (MOAAS 2-3, mean BIS=68), and a recovery period. Between deep sedation and recovery period, the infusion rate of propofol was increased to achieve unconsciousness (MOAAS 0-1, mean BIS=35); EEG measurements of recovery period were performed after subjects regained consciousness.
During deep sedation, the physical MMN was markedly reduced, but still significant. No ERAN was observed in this level. A clear P3a was elicited during deep sedation by those deviants, which were task-relevant during the awake state. As soon as subjects regained consciousness during the recovery period, a normal MMN was elicited. By contrast, the P3a was absent in the recovery period, and the P3b was markedly reduced.
Results indicate that the auditory sensory memory (as indexed by the physical MMN) is still active, although strongly reduced, during deep sedation (MOAAS 2-3). The presence of the P3a indicates that attention-related processes are still operating during this level. Processes of syntactic analysis appear to be abolished during deep sedation. After propofol-induced anesthesia, the auditory sensory memory appears to operate normal as soon as subjects regain consciousness, whereas the attention-related processes indexed by P3a and P3b are markedly impaired.
Results inform about effects of sedative drugs on auditory and attention-related mechanisms. The findings are important because these mechanisms are prerequisites for auditory awareness, auditory learning and memory, as well as language perception during anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16807099/

Stated that prediction probability or P(K) represents an indicator probability to predict correctly the rank order of an arbitrary pair of distinct observed indices of depth of hypnosis (ie, clinical settings and SpEn indices, or BIS, Ce, MAP, HR), PK of BIS, SE, RE, and Ce provided a better depth of hypnosis than MAP and HR; RE being the best for rapidity, SE for sensitivity, and BIS for specificity.

Although these anaesthetic agents display some similar clinical features, such as potent analgesic effects, there are some important differences. Ketamine and nitrous oxide produce sympathomimetic effects, whereas xenon produces a sympatholytic effect. In addition, these anaesthetic agents return differential signals on clinical available anaesthetic depth monitors such as the bispectral index and mid-latency auditory evoked potential. Ketamine and nitrous oxide do not per se decrease the bispectral index. However, xenon decreases the bispectral index in a concentration-dependent manner.

The authors studied 35 ASA I and II patients who were undergoing elective craniotomy and brain tumor resection. The patients were randomized to one of three groups to receive halothane (HAL), isoflurane (ISO), or sevoflurane (SEV). Anesthetic depth was initially adjusted using the bispectral index to 40+/-5, and NMB was adjusted to 40%-50% of one twitch of train of four (T1) after recovery from intubation. MEPs with train of five square-wave pulses were elicited using screw electrodes placed in the skull over C3-C4. After craniotomy, the inhalational agent was introduced at 0.5 MAC and then 1.0 MAC (20 minutes each), and the effects on MEPs, NMB, and hemodynamic variables were studied. A decrease in BIS and systolic blood pressure was observed with all agents. Both SEV and ISO at 1.0 MAC significantly decreased train-of-four ratio from 38.4+/-18.1 at control to 19.0+/-9.7 and from 35.3+/-12.4 to 26.1+/-13.7, respectively (P<0.001), but not HAL at 1.0 MAC. The amplitudes of tcMEPs were significantly reduced by all agents at 1.0 MAC, with the effect being less in HAL at 0.5 MAC. We have shown that HAL had a lesser suppressive effect on MEPs than either ISO or SEV at 0.5 MAC, which was partially due to a lesser degree of NMB.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16628063/

Nine human volunteers received three escalating drug concentrations: 0.2, 0.4 and 1.0 MAC end-tidal inhalation. During waking, baseline and the three levels of sedation, aO PET scan was performed.
Isoflurane decreased the bispectral index (BIS) values dose-dependently. Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were maintained constant over time. No significant change in global CBF was observed. Throughout all three MAC levels of sedation, isoflurane caused an increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the anterior cingulate and decreased rCBF in the cerebellum. Initially, isoflurane (0 vs. 0.2 MAC) significantly increased relative rCBF in the medial frontal gyrus and in the nucleus accumbens. At the next level (0.2 vs. 0.4 MAC), relative rCBF was significantly increased in the caudate nucleus and decreased in the lingual gyrus and cuneus. At the last level (0.4 vs. 1 MAC), relative rCBF was significantly increased in the insula and decreased in the thalamus, the cuneus and lingual gyrus. Compared with flow distribution in awake volunteers, 1 MAC of isoflurane significantly raised relative activity in the anterior cingulate and insula regions. In contrast, a significant relative flow reduction was identified in the thalamus, the cerebellum and lingual gyrus.
Isoflurane, like sevoflurane, induced characteristic flow redistribution at doses of 0.2-1.0 MAC. At 1 MAC of isoflurane, rCBF decreased in the thalamus. Specific areas affected by both isoflurane and sevoflurane included the anterior cingulate, insula regions, cerebellum, lingual gyrus and thalamus.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16480463/

Its widespread use makes it the most-studied and the best-known among same intended devices. Its algorithm processes low-frequency EEG oscillations in order to provide the Bispectral index. A BIS index ranging from 40 to 60 has been established as the proper for surgical performance. The BIS monitor permits a closer approach to the hypnotic component of anaesthesia beyond clinical signs and may reduce the probability of intraoperative awareness; therefore, it has become a recommended monitoring tool in routine practice. The SNAP monitor (Nicolet Biomedical, Madison WI, USA) is also intended for monitoring the hypnotic effect of anaesthetics, which is in turn displayed as an index ranging from 100 to 0, with 100 meaning a fully awake state and 0 meaning no brain activity. The algorithm of the SNAP monitor is featured by its additional processing of ultra-high EEG frequencies, which seem to be involved in the formation of consciousness. The use of these frequencies would theoretically improve responsiveness during increased brain activity. We studied its behaviour patterns and capability to monitor the hypnotic effect induced by sevoflurane-nitrous oxide by comparison with the BIS index. Seventy patients ASA I-III were induced with propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium, and maintained with sevoflurane-N(2)O. BIS and SNAP indices were simultaneously recorded before induction, after intubation, after incision, at the following 10, 30 and 50 minutes, awakening and extubation time points, together with heart rate and blood pressure. The Pearson correlation was R(2) = 0.68 (p < .05). The Bland and Altman test showed a bias of 14.3 for SNAP index values with respect to BIS index values. We concluded that the SNAP index correlates with variations in the hypnotic effect induced by sevoflurane-nitrous oxide anaesthesia when compared with the BIS index. In this context, a SNAP index ranging from 58 to 70 would be equivalent to the BIS index range 40 to 60 and, therefore, the accurate for surgical performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16437288/

We performed an observational prospective study in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital of 19 patients hospitalized nonconsecutively in the ICU with serious neurologic pathology and evolution toward BD. A BIS monitor, XP model, and the sensor ""BIS Quatro"" were used to continuously record values: suppression ratio (SR), quality of the signal index, and electromyographic (EMG) activity.
The BD diagnosis was made through neurological clinical exploration and electroencephalogram (EEG) in all the cases. Additionally, transcranial Doppler was used in 13 patients. Coincident with clinical worsening, it was observed that there was a gradual decrease of the BIS value, together with a rise in the SR. In all the patients in which the BD diagnosis was confirmed, the BIS showed values of 0 and suppression rates of 100. Only one patient showed interferences, due to EMG activity, the same problem was detected when a conventional EEG was performing. After using a neuromuscular blocker, the values of BIS and SR were 0 and 100, respectively.
The BIS is a noninvasive, simple, and easy to interpret method. All the patients with BD diagnosis except for one had a BIS value of 0 and TS of 100, showing a perfect correlation with the other diagnostic methods. The BIS cannot be used on its own for the confirmation of the BD, but it is a useful tool to detect the beginning of brain herniation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16386497/

Our aim was to investigate the role of using the bispectral index (BIS) in recovery from anesthesia and altering drug administration in patients undergoing craniotomy. Fifty American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) physical status I-II patients undergoing craniotomy were included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, and all patients received standard induction drugs, and 0.8%-1.5% sevoflurane was used for maintenance of anesthesia. In the BIS-guided group, the concentration of sevoflurane was titrated to maintain BIS at 40-60. In the control group, the anesthesiologist was blind to BIS, and the concentration of sevoflurane was changed according to the patients' hemodynamic changes. The hemodynamic data, BIS values, and sevoflurane concentrations were recorded every 15 minutes. In addition, the BIS value was recorded by the primary anesthetist in the BIS-guided group and by another independent anesthetist in the control group. At the end of the study, recovery criteria and Aldrete recovery scores were recorded every 15 minutes. Neurologic assessments were performed when the Aldrete score was 9-10. BIS values were higher, and sevoflurane concentrations (P < 0.05) and total doses of fentanyl (P < 0.01) were lower, in the BIS-guided group. Times to first spontaneous breathing, eye opening, and extubation (P = 0.035, P = 0.001, and P = 0.0001, respectively) were significantly shorter in the BIS-guided group. Time to an Aldrete score of 9-10 and adequate neurologic assessment were similar between the groups. In conclusion, BIS monitoring by supratentorial craniotomy under general anesthesia reduced the maintenance anesthetic concentration and narcotic drug usage and lowered the recovery times from general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16369133/

The bispectral index (BIS) monitor is a processed electroencephalographic parameter that noninvasively measures the hypnotic effect of anesthetic and sedative drugs on the brain. The objective of this study was to assess the degree of correlation between the COMFORT scale and the BIS monitor.
A prospective study in a tertiary level PICU.
A total of 75 children were enrolled in the study, resulting in 869 valid paired observations of BIS values and COMFORT scores. The median age was 10 months, with a range of 1 month to 12 yrs. The median COMFORT score was 11 (range, 8-40). The median BIS value was 52 (range, 0-98). In a repeated-measures analysis, the correlation coefficient between COMFORT scores and BIS values averaged over time was 0.61 (p < .0001).
The BIS monitor may be a valid and useful monitor of the level of sedation of children in the PICU. We cannot expect perfect correlation between BIS values and observational scales because they measure different variables. The BIS monitor may be the best objective monitor currently available for children receiving neuromuscular blockade because it does not rely on subjective measures such as those used in the COMFORT scale. The ability of the BIS monitor to distinguish between very deep levels of sedation may be useful to prevent over-sedation of children in PICUs and to help clarify the appropriate target level of sedation for each child.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16276329/

The EEG during this period was characterized by gradual prolongation of suppression periods until the appearance of the isoelectric line. After that, burst activity returned and eventually the burst suppression pattern disappeared. We excluded the possibility of ischemic brain damage, and the evidence increasingly points toward a greater sensitivity to propofol.

The authors explored the pharmacodynamics and safety of AQ and compared it with propofol lipid emulsion (PropofolD).
After institutional review board approval, 36 volunteers with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I were randomly allocated into six cohorts (male/female: 3/3 per cohort) and given a single bolus of AQ (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 mg/kg). A Bispectral Index monitor (Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Newton, MA) measured the hypnotic effect. The lowest Bispectral Index level (BISpeak) was recorded. One week later, PropofolD was given to the same subjects at 50 mg/min to reach a similar BISpeak. Heart rate, oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and side effects were monitored. Incidence and duration of apnea and loss (LOCverbal) and return of response to verbal command were measured. A population compartmental pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was developed for AQ using NONMEM and evaluated using simulations, leverage, and bootstrap analyses.
In the higher dosages (cohorts 4-6), all subjects achieved LOCverbal. Similar times until LOCverbal were seen for AQ and PropofolD. A dose-related increase in duration of LOCverbal was longer for AQ than for PropofolD. AQ BISpeak occurred later than with PropofolD. Pain on injection was only present with PropofolD (12 of 36). With AQ, transient paresthesias and pruritus were seen. Hemodynamic profiles were similar for both drugs, except for an initial tachycardia after AQ administration. Dose-dependent apnea was more pronounced with PropofolD than with AQ. The AQ combined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile was best described by a nonlinear, six-compartment pharmacokinetic model and an effect site compartment. A dependency of the ke0 value on the PropofolGPI plasma concentration was noted.
Bolus administration of AQ achieves LOCverbal at a similar time as an equipotent amount of PropofolD but shows a longer time to BISpeak and prolonged pharmacodynamics.

In this study, we compared women in the follicular phase with low progesterone levels and in the luteal phase with high progesterone levels regarding their anesthetic requirements. Twenty patients with menstrual cycle days from 1 to 10 (follicular group) and 20 patients with menstrual cycle days from 18 to 24 (luteal group) were included in the study. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl and thiopental; relaxation was secured with rocuronium, and anesthesia was maintained with a mixture of nitrous oxide 2 L/min and oxygen 2 L/min plus sevoflurane. The delivered sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to sustain a constant bispectral index value that averaged 46 in both groups. To determine the progesterone levels, blood samples were taken from all patients before surgery. We found that progesterone levels were 0.86 +/- 0.30 ng/mL in the follicular group and 7.48 +/- 3.86 ng/mL in the luteal group. The minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC)-hour (MAC-h) value of sevoflurane in the follicular group (1.55 +/- 0.18 MAC-h) was significantly larger than in the luteal group (1.3 +/- 0.13 MAC-h) (P < 0.0001). The sevoflurane requirements were larger in the follicular group during the maintenance phase of anesthesia. In conclusion, high progesterone levels during the luteal phase might be the cause of decreased anesthetic requirement.
The aim of this study was to determine the effect of high progesterone levels on anesthetic requirement.

The EEG changes with brain maturation, but there are limited published data describing the characteristics of entropy in children, and some data suggest that BIS is less reliable in young children. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of entropy as a measure of anaesthetic effect in different age groups. The performance of entropy was compared with BIS.
Fifty-four children receiving a standard sevoflurane anaesthetic for cardiac catheter studies were enrolled. The entropy and BIS were recorded pre-awakening and at 1.5%, 2% and 2.5% steady-state end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations. For analysis children were divided into four age groups: 0-1 yr, 1-2 yr, 2-4 yr and 4-12 yr.
The pre-awakening values were obtained in 46 children. The median pre-awakening values for entropy and BIS varied significantly across ages with the values being lowest in the 0-1 yr age group (response entropy: 45 vs 84, 87 and 89, P=0.003; state entropy: 36 vs 78, 74 and 77, P=0.009; BIS: 56 vs 78, 76.5 and 72, P=0.02). Values were recorded at all three sevoflurane concentrations in 48 children. Compared with older groups, the 0-1 yr age group had the least significant difference in BIS and entropy when compared among different sevoflurane concentrations. The calculated sevoflurane concentrations to achieve mid-scale values of entropy and BIS were highest in the 1-2 yr age group, lower in the 0-1 yr age group and progressively lower in the 2-4 and 4-12 yr age groups.
For both entropy and BIS the measure of anaesthetic effect was significantly different for children aged <1 yr compared with older children. There was no difference in performance of entropy and BIS. Both should be used cautiously in small children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16183678/

Alternatively, the authors report a recirculatory model of propofol disposition in a ""standard"" man that incorporates detailed descriptions of the lungs and brain, but with a lumped description of the remainder of the body. The model was parameterized from data in the literature using a ""meta-modeling"" approach. The first-pass passage of propofol through the venous vasculature and the lungs was a function of the injected drug mixing with cardiac output and passing through a three-""tank in series"" model for the lungs. The brain was represented as a two-compartment model defined by cerebral blood flow and a permeability term. The Bispectral Index was a linear function of the mean brain concentration. The remainder of the body was represented by compartment systems for the liver, fast distribution and slow distribution.
The model was a good fit of the data and was able to predict other data not used in the development of the model.

Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze the differences between the BIS values from monitor electrode strips placed on the left (left BIS) and the right (right BIS) sides of the head as well as the differences in the left and right BIS values before and after each injection of the barbiturate. Injection of barbiturate into either the left or right internal carotid artery produced a significant change on the 21-electrode EEG.

Although evidence is compelling that cerebral emboli are a major cause of perioperative central nervous system (CNS) morbidity in such patients, it is also apparent that alterations in cerebral perfusion pressure and blood flow can profoundly influence the extent of injury after an embolic insult. In this context, the recent studies demonstrating improved CNS outcomes with applied neuromonitoring in cardiac surgical patients can be understood as reflecting the optimization of CNS perfusion characteristics with potential amelioration of microembolic injury. This review critically evaluates and discusses the relevant characteristics of applied neuromonitoring techniques, including bispectral index (BIS), transcranial Doppler (TCD), and near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) in the context of patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures. Recent outcomes data regarding CNS and related morbidity and the influence of neuromonitoring in these groups are evaluated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15735841/

Anesthesia providers (n = 69) were randomly assigned to one of two groups, a BIS or non-BIS control group. A randomized crossover design was used, with reassignment at monthly intervals for 7 months. Duration of time in the postanesthesia care unit, time from the end of surgery to leaving the operating room, and incidence of delayed recovery (> 50 min in recovery) were compared in patients treated intraoperatively with or without BIS monitoring. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance, unpaired t test, or chi-square test as appropriate.
One thousand five hundred eighty patients in an academic medical center were studied. The mean BIS in the monitored group was 47. No differences were found in recovery parameters between the BIS-monitored group and the control group when comparisons were made using all subjects or when data were analyzed within anesthetic subgroups stratified by anesthetic agent or duration of anesthesia. There were some small reductions in the intraoperative concentration of sevoflurane (but not isoflurane).

Our goal is to determine in this population the correlation between the Bispectral Index (BIS) and three commonly used sedation agitation scales: the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), the Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores.
Prospective, single-blinded observational study.
Eight-bed neurology-neurosurgery intensive care unit at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
Thirty critically ill patients admitted to the neurointensive care unit with primary brain injury and a decreased level of consciousness.
Patients were prospectively evaluated for level of consciousness using the RASS, SAS, and GCS every hour and simultaneously were monitored continuously with a BIS monitor for 6 hrs. A Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to correlate the BIS scores with clinical scales. In 15 patients monitored with the newer BIS XP version, the BIS values correlated significantly with the RASS (R2 = .810; p < .0001), SAS (R2 = .725; p < .0001), and GCS (R2 = .655; p < .0001). In 15 patients monitored with the older BIS 2.1.1 software, the correlation was as follows: for RASS, R2 = .30 (p < .008), for SAS: R2 = .376 (p < .001), and for GCS: R2 = .274 (p < .015). This correlation was maintained in patients who received sedative medications.
A statistically significant correlation existed between BIS values and the RASS, SAS, and GCS scores in critically ill brain-injured patients, with and without sedation.

15564949,Effect of pain and audiovisual stimulation on the depression of acute hypoxic ventilatory response by low-dose halothane in humans.,Anesthesiology,2004,"Pandit JJ, Moreau B, Donoghue S, Robbins PA","The effects of different low-dose volatile agents in blunting the acute hypoxic ventilatory response (AHVR) are variable. Arousal (due to audiovisual stimulation) may prevent isoflurane-induced blunting of AHVR. The purpose of this study was to assess whether this was also the case for halothane. The authors also assessed the effects of pain on the interaction of halothane and AHVR.
Step decreases in end-tidal partial pressure of oxygen using dynamic end-tidal forcing were performed from normoxia to hypoxia (50 mmHg) in 10 healthy volunteers, with end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide held 1-2 mmHg above normal, in six protocols: (1) control conditions (darkened, quiet room, eyes closed) without halothane and (2) with 0.1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) halothane; (3) audiovisual stimulation (bright room, loud television) without halothane and (4) with 0.1 MAC halothane; (5) pain (electrical stimulation of skin over the tibia to produce a visual analog pain score of 5-6 out of 10) without halothane and (6) with 0.1 MAC halothane. The Bispectral Index of the electroencephalogram was also monitored.
Halothane did not affect normoxic minute ventilation in any arousal state but significantly reduced the magnitude of AHVR by 50% regardless of the background arousal state (P < 0.001). Bispectral Index values were reduced by halothane only in the absence of arousal (P < 0.003). Both pain and audiovisual stimulation modestly increased normoxic minute ventilation (P < 0.002) and AHVR (P < 0.003).
Audiovisual stimulation does not prevent the blunting of AHVR by low-dose halothane. This result with halothane differs from previous results with isoflurane. Therefore, different anesthetics interact in different ways with arousal states. This finding raises the possibility that different anesthetics might differentially affect the hypoxic chemoreflex loop or that they might act in the brain at sites separate from the chemoreflex loop, differently to influence the wakefulness drive to ventilation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15564949/

However, this fundamental characteristic has not been extensively investigated in humans. We studied (11)C-flumazenil binding to GABA(A) receptors during sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia in the living human brain using positron emission tomography (PET). Fourteen healthy male subjects underwent 2 60-min dynamic PET studies with (11)C-labeled flumazenil, awake and during anesthesia. Anesthesia was maintained with 2% end-tidal sevoflurane (n = 7) or propofol at a target plasma concentration of 9.0 +/- 3.0 (mean +/- sd) microg/mL (n = 7). The depth of anesthesia was measured with bispectral index (BIS). Values of regional distribution volumes (DV) of (11)C-flumazenil were calculated in several brain areas using metabolite-corrected arterial plasma curves and a two-compartment model. Separate voxel-based statistical analysis using parametric DV images was performed for detailed visualization. The average BIS index was 35 +/- 6 in the sevoflurane group and 28 +/- 8 in the propofol group (P = 0.02). Sevoflurane increased the DV of (11)C-flumazenil significantly (P < 0.05) in all brain areas studied except the pons and the white matter. In the propofol group the increases were significant (P < 0.05) in the caudatus, putamen, cerebellum, thalamus and the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Furthermore, the DV increases in the frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal cortical areas and in the putamen were statistically significantly larger in the sevoflurane than in the propofol group.

In this study we tested whether different brain regions were affected by propofol and thiopental at similar drug effects. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were identified by using SPM99 analysis of images obtained with positron emission tomography with (15)O water. Ten right-handed male volunteers (age, 35 +/- 10 yr; weight, 74.1 +/- 7.5 kg; mean +/- sd) were randomized to receive thiopental (n = 4) or propofol (n = 6) to target sedative and hypnotic concentrations with bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. Four positron emission tomography images were obtained during various tasks at baseline and with sedative and hypnotic effects. Two participants receiving propofol were unresponsive at sedative concentrations and were not included in the final analyses. Median serum concentrations were 1.2 and 2.7 microg/mL for sedative and hypnotic propofol effects, respectively. Similarly, thiopental concentrations were 4.8 and 10.6 microg/mL. BIS decreased similarly in both groups. The pattern of rCBF change was markedly different for propofol and thiopental. Propofol decreased rCBF in the anterior (right-sided during sedation) brain regions, whereas thiopental decreased rCBF primarily in the cerebellar and posterior brain regions. At similar levels of drug effect, propofol and thiopental affect different regions of the brain.

Sixteen patients with consciousness disturbance, who were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary university-affiliated children's hospital, were enrolled in this study. The patients received 34 Glasgow Coma Scale assessments and Bispectral Index scores. The age of patients ranged from 10 to 192 months (mean +/- S.E. = 68.4 +/- 12.3 months). Glasgow Coma Scale ranged from 3 to 11 (mean +/- S.E. = 6.3 +/- 0.4), and Bispectral Index score ranged from 0 to 100 (mean +/- S.E. = 55.4 +/- 5.6). A positive correlation was found to exist between Glasgow Coma Scale and Bispectral Index score (r = 0.76, P < 0.001).

However, there is no objective physiologic parameter available to monitor a patient's conscious state. The Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor has been validated as an objective measure of depth of anaesthesia. We studied the BIS monitor for this role in procedural sedation.
A prospective, observational study with convenience sampling of adult patients in ED who underwent procedural sedation. Patients were treated according to standard practice and sedated as determined by the treating physician. Treating physicians were blinded to the BIS value. BIS values were recorded and compared to the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAAS). Upon recovery, patients were asked about recall of events while they were sedated.
Twelve patients were enrolled and 110 paired readings from 11 patients (7 male) were obtained. It was not possible to obtain readings from one patient. The mean age was 58 years (range 20-94). The Spearman correlation between BIS and OAAS was 0.027 (95% CI -0.582-0.617). For the three patients who received propofol, the correlation was 1.0.

The objective of this study was to establish a relation between the Bispectral Index (BIS) and other variables derived from the analysis of the electroencephalographic signal, with the probability of recovering consciousness in patients in a coma state due to severe cerebral damage.
Twenty-five critically ill, unconscious brain-injured patients from whom sedative drugs were withdrawn at least 24 h before BIS recording were prospectively studied. BIS, 95% spectral edge frequency, burst suppression ratio, and frontal electromyography were recorded for 20 min. The neurologic condition of the patients was measured according to the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). Patients were followed up for assessment of recovery of consciousness for 6 months after the injury. The studied variables were compared between the group of patients who recovered consciousness and those who did not recover. Their predictive ability was evaluated by means of the Pk statistic. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to model the relation between variables and probability of recovery of consciousness. Cross-validation was used to validate the proposed model.

Recent evidence suggests that spinal cord anaesthesia modifies reticulo-thalamo-cortical arousal by decreasing afferent sensory transmission. We hypothesized that epidural anaesthesia produces sensory deafferentation-dependent sedation that is associated with impairment of brainstem transmission. We used brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) to evaluate reticular function in 11 volunteers.
Epidural anaesthesia was induced with 2-chloroprocaine 2%. Haemodynamic and respiratory responses, sensory block level, sedation depth and BAEP were assessed throughout induction and resolution of epidural anaesthesia. Sedation was evaluated using verbal rating score (VRS), observer's assessment alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score, and bispectral index score (BIS). Prediction probability (PK) was used to associate sensory block with sedation, as well as BIS with other sedation measures. Spearman's rank order correlation was used to associate block level and sedation with the absolute and interpeak BAEP latencies.
Sensory block level significantly predicted VRS (PK=0.747), OAA/S score (PK=0.748) and BIS. BIS predicted VRS and OAA/S score (PK=0.728). The latency of wave III of BAEP significantly correlated with sedation level (rho=0.335, P<0.01) and sensory block (rho=0.394, P<0.01). The other BAEP parameters did not change during epidural anaesthesia. Haemodynamic and respiratory responses remained stable throughout the study.
Sedation during epidural anaesthesia depends on sensory block level and is associated with detectable block-dependent alterations in the brainstem auditory evoked responses. Sensory deafferentation may reduce CNS alertness through mechanisms related to brainstem neural activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15220178/

EEG was monitored by either BIS, spectral edge frequency by pEEG, or A-AEP index by A-AEP. We recorded the number of patients with impedance low enough to extract good EEG signals at the first electrodes application (success rate), the number with an index outside of the range considered appropriate for general anesthesia (inappropriateness rate), changes of the index by LMA insertion or surgical incision (responsiveness), and time to return to good EEG signals after signal disturbance by electric cautery (recovery time).

This study investigated the hypothesis that learning during anaesthesia occurs during, but not before, surgical stimulation.
Words were played through headphones to 64 day-surgery patients during propofol anaesthesia. Fourteen words were played repeatedly (15 times) for 1 min each either before (n=32) or during (n=32) surgical stimulation. The depth of anaesthesia was estimated using the bispectral index (BIS). Heart rate, ventilatory frequency, mean arterial pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, and infusion rate of propofol were recorded at 1 min intervals during word presentation. On recovery, memory was assessed using an auditory word stem completion test and word recognition test.
The mean BIS, arterial pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide and heart rate during word presentation did not differ between the groups. The infusion rate of propofol and the ventilatory frequency were significantly greater in the during-surgical stimulation group. There was no evidence for explicit recall or recognition, nor of awareness during anaesthesia (median mean-BIS=38 in the before-surgical stimulation group and 42 in the during-surgical stimulation group). Only patients who were played words during surgical stimulation showed significant implicit memory on recovery (mean score=0.08, P<0.02) However, their scores were not significantly higher than those of the before-surgical stimulation group (mean score=0.01).

However, there is a limited relationship between preset targets and measured concentrations of drugs and between measured concentrations and measures of brain function, such as the bispectral index (BIS).
We set out to evaluate the performance of TCI devices for propofol (Diprifusor) and remifentanil (Remifusor, prototype), during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 21 patients. We also checked if there was any correlation between serum concentrations of propofol and BIS during individually adjusted anaesthesia.
The Diprifusor and Remifusor had a median absolute performance error of 60% and 25% respectively. Propofol concentrations were underpredicted by a median of 60%, and remifentanil concentrations were slightly overpredicted by a median of 7%. When anaesthesia was adjusted to keep BIS values between 45 and 60, no correlation existed between measured concentrations of propofol and the corresponding BIS values, although both BIS and serum propofol concentration discriminated well between the awake and asleep states. Emergence was rapid and uneventful in all patients. Female patients had a more rapid emergence than male patients (6.6 and 11.6 min respectively).
TCI devices for remifentanil and propofol result in large variation in measured serum concentrations. The lack of correlation between BIS and serum concentrations of propofol adds to the debate about whether BIS measures hypnosis as a graded state during surgery. This study confirms that women wake up faster than men, but provides no explanation for this repeatedly shown difference.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14633743/

The authors quantified the effects of sevoflurane and propofol as sole anesthetics and in combination with N2O on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2), and blood volume (rCBV) in the living human brain using positron emission tomography.
15O-labeled water, oxygen, and carbon monoxide were used as positron emission tomography tracers to determine rCBF, rCMRO2 and rCBV, respectively, in eight healthy male subjects during the awake state (baseline) and at four different anesthetic regimens: (1) sevoflurane alone, (2) sevoflurane plus 70% N2O (S+N), (3) propofol alone, and (4) propofol plus 70% N2O (P+N). Sevoflurane and propofol were titrated to keep a constant hypnotic depth (Bispectral Index 40) throughout anesthesia. End-tidal carbon dioxide was strictly kept at preinduction level.
The mean +/- SD end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was 1.5 +/- 0.3% during sevoflurane alone and 1.2 +/- 0.3% during S+N (P < 0.001). The measured propofol concentration was 3.7 +/- 0.7 microg/ml during propofol alone and 3.5 +/- 0.7 microg/ml during P+N (not significant). Sevoflurane alone decreased rCBF in some (to 73-80% of baseline, P < 0.01), and propofol in all brain structures (to 53-70%, P < 0.001). Only propofol reduced also rCBV (in the cortex and cerebellum to 83-86% of baseline, P < 0.05). Both sevoflurane and propofol similarly reduced rCMRO2 in all brain areas to 56-70% and 50-68% of baseline, respectively (P < 0.05). The adjunct N2O counteracted some of the rCMRO2 and rCBF reductions caused by drugs alone, and especially during S+N, a widespread reduction (P < 0.05 for all cortex and cerebellum vs. awake) in the oxygen extraction fraction was seen. Adding of N2O did not alter the rCBV effects of sevoflurane and propofol alone.
Propofol reduced rCBF and rCMRO2 comparably. Sevoflurane reduced rCBF less than propofol but rCMRO2 to an extent similar to propofol. These reductions in flow and metabolism were partly attenuated by adjunct N2O. S+N especially reduced the oxygen extraction fraction, suggesting disturbed flow-activity coupling in humans at a moderate depth of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12960544/

The most essential monitor continues to be the electrocardiogram. However, monitoring diastolic blood pressure, myocardial perfusion pressure, and end-tidal carbon dioxide are extremely useful. Most of the current research on monitoring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation focuses on methods for analyzing ventricular fibrillation waveforms. By analyzing the waveform, defibrillation shocks may be delivered at the time when the chance of success is optimal. Low-amplitude and low-frequency fibrillation waveforms are associated with increased rates of asystole and pulseless electrical activity after defibrillation. Methods of analyzing the ventricular fibrillation waveform include measuring the amplitude and frequency and combining the contributions of amplitude and frequency by various methods to improve discrimination. Other types of monitoring being studied for their usefulness during cardiac arrests include sonography, Bispectral Index monitoring, tissue carbon dioxide monitors, and pupil observation. The test of these monitoring techniques is ultimately their ability to improve patient survival to hospital discharge, which is a major challenge for resuscitation researchers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12771672/

This study measured the brain uptake of propofol in humans and the simultaneous effects on electroencephalography, cerebral blood flow velocity (V(mca)), and cerebral oxygen extraction.
Seven subjects had arterial and jugular bulb catheters placed before induction. Electroencephalography and V(mca) were recorded during induction with propofol while blood samples were taken from both catheters for later propofol analysis. Brain uptake of propofol was calculated using mass balance principles, with effect compartment modeling used to quantitate the rate of uptake.
Bispectral index (electroencephalogram) values decreased to a minimum value of approximately 4 at around 7 min from the onset of propofol administration and then slowly recovered. This was accompanied by decreases in V(mca), reaching a minimum value of approximately 40% of baseline. Cerebral oxygen extraction did not change, suggesting parallel changes in cerebral metabolism. There was slow equilibrium of propofol between the blood and the brain (t(1/2keo) of 6.5 min), with a close relation between brain concentrations and bispectral index, although with considerable interpatient variability. The majority of the decreases in V(mca), and presumably cerebral metabolism, corresponded with bispectral index values reaching 40-50 and the onset of burst suppression.

Fifty patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy received combined epidural and general anesthesia or general anesthesia alone with isoflurane and alfentanil. Isoflurane was administered by computer-controlled closed-loop feedback to maintain an EEG 95% spectral edge frequency of 17.5 Hz, a target chosen on the basis of a pilot study. In epidural patients, end-tidal isoflurane concentration (FE'(ISO)) was 0.19% smaller (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.32% to -0.06%; P < 0.01), mean arterial blood pressure was 17 mm Hg lower (95% CI, -24 to -9 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), and body temperature was 0.4 degrees C lower (95% CI, -0.7 to 0 degrees C; P < 0.05) than in controls. EEG bispectral index (BIS) was 4 points higher (95% CI, 1 to 7; P < 0.05). EEG median frequency and heart rate were similar in both groups. Epidural patients were 76% more likely (95% CI, 58% to 94%; P < 0.001) to require metaraminol for hypotension and were 28% more likely (95% CI, 3% to 53%; P < 0.05) to require glycopyrrolate for bradycardia. After surgery, the time to eye opening in epidural patients was 2.3 min shorter (95% CI, -4.2 to -0.5 min; P < 0.05).

Using H(2)(15)O, rCBF was assessed in 16 healthy (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] physical status I) volunteers awake and at three escalating drug concentrations: 1, 1.5, and 2 MAC/EC(50), or specifically, at either 2, 3, and 4% end-tidal sevoflurane (n = 8), or 6, 9, and 12 microg/ml plasma concentration of propofol (n = 8). Rocuronium was used for muscle relaxation.
Both drugs decreased the bispectral index and blood pressure dose-dependently. Comparison between adjacent levels showed that sevoflurane initially (0 vs. 1 MAC) reduced absolute rCBF by 36-53% in all areas, then (1 vs. 1.5 MAC) increased rCBF in the frontal cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum (7-16%), and finally (1.5 vs. 2 MAC) caused a dual effect with a 23% frontal reduction and a 38% cerebellar increase. In the propofol group, flow was also initially reduced by 62-70%, with minor further effects. In the SPM analysis of the ""awake to 1 MAC/EC(50)"" step, both anesthetic agents reduced relative rCBF in the cuneus, precuneus, posterior limbic system, and the thalamus or midbrain; additionally, propofol reduced relative rCBF in the parietal and frontal cortices.
Both anesthetic agents caused a global reduction of rCBF (propofol > sevoflurane) at the 1 MAC/EC(50) level.

Forty patients were anesthetized with alfentanil 50 microg/kg i.v., nitrous oxide, propofol target-controlled infusion, and rocuronium. The bispectral index (version 3.12) was monitored continuously. Patients were randomized to a core temperature of 34 degrees C or 37 degrees C. At the end of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed, nitrous oxide was ceased, and propofol was infused to achieve a blood target determined by the previous patient's response. Responsiveness to command was assessed 15 min later. Results were analyzed with logistic regression models; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The CP50-awake of propofol was 3.05 microg/mL (95% confidence interval, 2.34-3.66). Propofol concentration, but not core temperature, predicted loss of response to command (odds ratio, 11.76; 95% confidence interval, 2.40-57.63; P < 0.01). Core temperature did not alter the relationship between bispectral index and response to command. Propofol infusion regimens may not require adjustment during mild hypothermia.

Thirty-six patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I or II were recruited, of which 12 received a target remifentanil concentration of 0 ng/ml, eight 2 ng/ml, eight 4 ng/ml, and another eight 8 ng/ml. Next (before surgery), several step-wise changes in the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (F(ET,sevo)) were performed. A data acquisition system simultaneously recorded F(ET,sevo), the raw electroencephalogram, BIS, and SEF. The authors used a combination of an effect compartment and an inhibitory sigmoid E(MAX) model to describe the relation between F(ET,sevo) and BIS, SEF, and CUP. Model parameters (t(1/2)k(e0), E(MAX), E(MIN), C(50), gamma, CUP weight factors) were estimated using the population data analysis program NONMEM. Significant remifentanil model parameter dependencies (P < 0.01) were determined.
Determined from SEF, remifentanil had no effect on t(1/2)k(e0) (1.91 +/- 0.26 min [mean +/- standard error]) but caused an increase in C(50) (baseline = 1.48 +/- 0.12%; 80% increase at 8 ng/ml) and decrease in E(MIN) (baseline = 10.8 +/- 0.6 Hz; 80% reduction at 8 ng/ml). Determined from CUP, remifentanil caused a dose-dependent decrease in t(1/2)k(e0) (baseline = 4.31 +/- 1.00 min; 60% decrease at 8 ng/ml), with no effect on C(50) (baseline = 0.88 +/- 0.13%). Determined from BIS, remifentanil caused a dose-dependent decrease in t(1/2)k(e0) (baseline value = 3.11 +/- 0.32 min; 40% decrease at 8 ng/ml), without affecting C(50) (baseline = 1.12 +/- 0.05%).

Addition of remifentanil increased the R(2) values for CUP only.

Ideally, to guide anesthetic management, range of BIS scores at different sedation levels should not overlap, and BIS should be independent of drug used. This study assessed ability of BIS to predict sedation depth between sevoflurane, propofol, and midazolam. Quality of recovery was also compared.
Patients undergoing surgery with local or regional anesthesia and sedation were randomized to sevoflurane (n = 23), midazolam (n = 21), or propofol (n = 22). Sedation was titrated to Observers's Assessment of Alertness-Sedation score of 3 (responds slowly to voice). BIS and Observers's Assessment of Alertness-Sedation were measured every 5 min. BIS prediction probability (PK) was compared between drugs. Recovery was assessed by BIS and Digit Symbol Substitution and memory tests.
Bispectral Index of responders to voice was significantly different from nonresponders (86 +/- 10 vs. 74 +/- 14, mean +/- SD; P < 0.001) However, wide variability and overlap in BIS were observed (25th-75th percentile, responders vs. non-responders: 79-96 vs. 65-83). BIS of responders was different for sevoflurane versus propofol and midazolam. BIS was a better predictor of propofol sedation than sevoflurane or midazolam (PK = 0.87 +/- 0.11, 0.76 +/- 0.01, and 0.69 +/- 0.02, respectively; P < 0.05).

An anaesthetic depth monitor must discriminate in real time between wakefulness and unconsciousness. The present study created a period of wakefulness during propofol-induced hypnosis. Bispectral index (BIS), explicit and implicit memories of the awake period were investigated.
Ten volunteers were studied. The calculated brain concentration of a target controlled infusion of propofol was increased until loss of response (LOR) to verbal command and then propofol was stopped. When fully awake, volunteers were presented with a picture, sound and smell. Propofol infusion was restarted until LOR and then ceased. BIS and the calculated brain concentration of propofol were recorded every minute. A structured interview was conducted for explicit memories after awakening and for explicit as well as implicit memories the day after.
Median BIS-index for the transition between awake and asleep and vice versa differed significantly. It was not possible, however, to establish any threshold value or zone for discriminating between wakefulness and LOR due to the large inter-individual variations in BIS-index. No volunteer could explicitly recall any of the stimuli presented during the period of wakefulness.
The BIS-index decreases with increasing sedation but because of the large individual variations, the real-time BIS-index for the individual subject cannot reliably discriminate wakefulness from unconsciousness during propofol infusion. Propofol causes such profound amnesia that lack of postoperative recall does not assure that episodes of awareness have not occurred during propofol-induced hypnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11472283/

Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures mixed-effects method, taking into account temperature, age, and predicted level of each anesthetic.
A significant overall association between temperature and BIS was observed independent of patient age, predicted brain midazolam or fentanyl concentration, percent isoflurane administered, and surgical time point (p < 0.001). The BIS is estimated to decrease by 1.12 units for each degree Celsius decrease in body temperature.
Hypothermia decreases the BIS by 1.12 units per degree Celsius decline in temperature.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11435056/
11374596,Surgical stimulation shifts EEG concentration-response relationship of desflurane.,Anesthesiology,2001,"Röpcke H, Rehberg B, Koenen-Bergmann M, Bouillon T, Bruhn J, Hoeft A","Anesthesiologists routinely increase the delivered anesthetic concentration before surgical stimulation in anticipation of increased anesthetic requirement to achieve certain goals (e.g., amnesia, unconsciousness, and immobility). Electroencephalographic monitoring is one method of determining indirectly anesthetic effect on the brain. The present study investigated the effect of surgical stimuli on the concentration-response relation of desflurane-induced electroencephalographic changes.
The electroencephalographic activity was recorded from 24 female patients who received only desflurane after a single induction dose of propofol. Twelve patients served as a control group before surgical stimulation. The other 12 patients, all undergoing lower abdominal surgery, were investigated between opening and closure of the peritoneum. Desflurane vaporizer settings were randomly increased and decreased between 0.5 and 1.6 minimum alveolar concentration as long as anesthesia was considered adequate. Spectral edge frequency 95, median power frequency, and Bispectral Index were calculated. Desflurane effect-site concentrations and the concentration-effect curves for spectral edge frequency 95, median power frequency, and Bispectral Index were determined by simultaneous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling.
Surgical stimulation shifted the desflurane concentration-electroencephalographic effect curves for spectral edge frequency 95, median power frequency, and Bispectral Index toward higher desflurane concentrations. In the unstimulated group, 2.2 +/- 0.74 vol% desflurane were necessary to achieve a Bispectral Index of 50, whereas during surgery, 6.8 +/- 0.98 vol% (mean +/- SE) were required.
During surgery, higher concentrations of the volatile anesthetic are required to achieve a desired level of cortical electrical activity and, presumably, anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11374596/

Artusio in 1954 used unprocessed electroencephalographic waveform analysis during an ether anesthetic to study the first stage of anesthesia. Some of the first automated electroencephalographic processors used power spectrum analysis for assessment of the patient's brain activity during surgery and anesthesia.

11093988,Auditory steady-state response and bispectral index for assessing level of consciousness during propofol sedation and hypnosis.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2000,"Bonhomme V, Plourde G, Meuret P, Fiset P, Backman SB","We assessed the effect of propofol on the auditory steady-state response (ASSR), bispectral (BIS) index, and level of consciousness in two experiments. In Experiment 1, propofol was infused in 11 subjects to obtain effect-site concentrations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 microg/mL. The ASSR and BIS index were recorded during baseline and at each concentration. The ASSR was evoked by monaural stimuli. Propofol caused a concentration-dependent decrease of the ASSR and BIS index values (r(2) = 0.76 and 0.93, respectively; P<0.0001). The prediction probability for loss of consciousness was 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 for ASSR, BIS, and arterial blood concentration of propofol, respectively. In Experiment 2, we compared the effects of binaural versus monaural stimulus delivery on the ASSR in six subjects during awake baseline and propofol-induced unconsciousness. During baseline, the ASSR amplitude with binaural stimulation (0.47+/-0.13 microV, mean +/- SD) was significantly (P<0.002) larger than with monaural stimulation (0.35+/-0.11 microV). During unconsciousness, the amplitude was 0.09+/-0.09 microV with monaural and 0.06+/-0.04 microV with binaural stimulation (NS). The prediction probability for loss of consciousness was 0.97 (0.04 SE) for monaural and 1.00 (0.00 SE) for binaural delivery. We conclude that the ASSR and BIS index are attenuated in a concentration-dependent manner by propofol and provide a useful measure of its sedative and hypnotic effect. BIS was easier to use and slightly more sensitive. The ASSR should be recorded with binaural stimulation. The ASSR and BIS index are both useful for assessing the level of consciousness during sedation and hypnosis with propofol. However, the BIS index was simpler to use and provided a more sensitive measure of sedation.
We have compared two methods for predicting whether the amount of propofol given to a human subject is sufficient to cause unconsciousness, defined as failure to respond to a simple verbal command. The two methods studied are the auditory steady-state response, which measures the electrical response of the brain to sound, and the bispectral index, which is a number derived from the electroencephalogram. The results showed that both methods are very good predictors of the level of consciousness; however, bispectral was easier to use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11093988/
10969304,Physostigmine reverses propofol-induced unconsciousness and attenuation of the auditory steady state response and bispectral index in human volunteers.,Anesthesiology,2000,"Meuret P, Backman SB, Bonhomme V, Plourde G, Fiset P","It is postulated that alteration of central cholinergic transmission plays an important role in the mechanism by which anesthetics produce unconsciousness. The authors investigated the effect of altering central cholinergic transmission, by physostigmine and scopolamine, on unconsciousness produced by propofol.
Propofol was administered to American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 (n = 17) volunteers with use of a computer-controlled infusion pump at increasing concentrations until unconsciousness resulted (inability to respond to verbal commands, abolition of spontaneous movement). Central nervous system function was assessed by use of the Auditory Steady State Response (ASSR) and Bispectral Index (BIS) analysis of electrooculogram. During continuous administration of propofol, reversal of unconsciousness produced by physostigmine (28 microgram/kg) and block of this reversal by scopolamine (8.6 microgram/kg) were evaluated.
Propofol produced unconsciousness at a plasma concentration of 3.2 +/- 0.8 (+/- SD) microgram/ml (n = 17). Unconsciousness was associated with reductions in ASSR (0.10 +/- 0.08 microV [awake baseline 0.32 +/- 0.18 microV], P < 0.001) and BIS (55.7 +/- 8.8 [awake baseline 92.4 +/- 3.9], P < 0.001). Physostigmine restored consciousness in 9 of 11 subjects, with concomitant increases in ASSR (0.38 +/- 0.17 microV, P < 0.01) and BIS (75.3 +/- 8.3, P < 0.001). In all subjects (n = 6) scopolamine blocked the physostigmine-induced reversal of unconsciousness and the increase of the ASSR and BIS (ASSR and BIS during propofol-induced unconsciousness: 0.09 +/- 0.09 microV and 58.2 +/- 7.5, respectively; ASSR and BIS after physostigmine administration: 0.08 +/- 0.06 microV and 56.8 +/- 6.7, respectively, NS).

Empirically derived from the EEGs of more than 5,000 anaesthetised patients, the BIS reflects the effect of anaesthetics on the brain. Unlike univariate measures, such as Spectral Edge Frequency or Median Frequency, the Bispectral Index is drug independent and changes with increasing doses of hypnotics in an almost linear way.

After receiving 15 microg of intravenous epinephrine, changes in sedation score and bispectral index (BIS) were observed. Mean pulse rate increased from 68 to 96 (SD 10) beat.min-1, mean blood pressure increased from 107/60 (SD 10/8) mmHg to 140/70 (SD 27/14) mmHg, and mean BIS level rose from 63 to 76 (p < 0.005). Sedation scores increased in six of the eight patients. Exogenous catecholamines seem to have an arousal effect on lightly anaesthetised patients.

The goal of this investigation was to determine the time course of plasma concentration and the effects of propofol demonstrated by electroencephalogram or blood pressure changes and to compare them between elderly and young or middle-aged patients.
A target-controlled infusion was used to rapidly attain and maintain four sequentially increasing, randomly selected plasma propofol concentrations from 1 to 12 microg/ml in 41 patients aged 20-85 yr. The target concentration was maintained for about 30 min. Bispectral index (BIS), spectral edge frequency, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were used as measures of propofol effect. Because the time courses of these measures following the started drug infusion showed an exponential pattern, the first-order rate constant for equilibration of the effect site with the plasma concentration (k(eO)) was estimated by fitting a monoexponential model to the effect versus time data resulting from the pseudo-steady-state propofol plasma concentration profile.
The half-times for the plasma-effect-site equilibration for BIS were 2.31, 2.30, 2.29, and 2.37 min in patients aged 20-39, 40-59, 60-69, and 70-85 yr, respectively (n = 10 or 11 each). The half-times for SBP were 5.68, 5.92, 8.87, and 10.22 min in the respective age groups. All were significantly longer than for BIS (P < 0.05). The propofol concentration at half of the maximal decrease of SBP was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the elderly than in the younger patients.
The effect of propofol on BIS occurs more rapidly than its effect on SBP. Age has no effect on the rate of BIS reduction with increasing propofol concentration, whereas with increasing age, SBP decreases to a greater degree but more slowly.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10360846/

Premedication consisted of hydroxyzine, alprazolam, and atropine given orally 1 hour before surgery. Anesthesia was provided with propofol (PPF) and SUF using a target-controlled infusion device. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups according to calculated plasma concentrations: 3 microg/mL(-1) of PPF and 0.5 ng/mL(-1) of SUF in group I (GI) and 3 microg/mL(-1) of PPF and 1 ng/mL(-1) of SUF in group II (GII). The MH was fixed 33.0+/-6.6 minutes (mean +/- SD) after induction. Systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) as well as heart rate (HR) and BIS were recorded 1 minute before pinning (baseline) as well as 1 minute (P1), 2 minutes (P2), and 3 minutes (P3) after pinning. Multivariate repeat-measured analyses of variance were applied to the baseline-subtracted measurements of hemodynamic and BIS values. Groups were compared using the Student's t test, and P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant. Patients' characteristics, baseline hemodynamic values, and BIS values were similar in both groups. A significant overall time effect was observed for all variables, but no significant overall SUF effect was detected. Increases in SAP, MAP, DAP, and HR did not differ significantly between groups. The increase in hemodynamic variables did not exceed 20% of baseline value in either group. In contrast, at P1, the increase in BIS over the baseline value was significantly higher in GI (15.0+/-7.9) than in GII (6.7+/-6.5). In conclusion, MH application was associated with a significant, although not clinically relevant, increase in hemodynamic variables whatever the calculated plasma SUF concentration (0.5 or 1.0 ng/mL(-1)). In contrast, the increase in BIS observed at pinning was significantly higher in patients with the lowest calculated plasma SUF concentrations. This suggests that the BIS response to noxious stimulation is modulated by the analgesic regimen.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10213433/
9726194,Awareness during general anesthesia: new technology for an old problem.,CRNA : the clinical forum for nurse anesthetists,1998,Halliburton JR,"The possibility of awareness during general anesthesia causes apprehension for the patient and the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA). The goals of general anesthesia are to prevent the sensation of pain and produce a state of sedation, hypnosis, and unconsciousness so the patient will not remember the surgical procedure. An inadequate level of anesthesia can result in patient awareness during surgery. The current practice of anesthesia relies on indirect hemodynamic measurements such as blood pressure and heart rate to monitor the sedative hypnotic state of the patient's brain during general anesthesia. Hemodynamic responses are not reliable for predicting awareness just as blood pressure and heart rate are not indicative of consciousness. Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms are known to be affected by anesthetics. Characteristic EEG waveforms are a direct indication of the patient's level of consciousness. Unprocessed and computer-processed EEG recordings have been used in an attempt to monitor the patient's level of consciousness during general anesthesia. A raw or unprocessed EEG recording to monitor the level of consciousness during general anesthesia is problematic. The EEG signal is complex, affected by artifact, and it requires a dedicated interpreter. Conventional processed EEG monitoring systems are problematic because of the complexity of the equipment and technical difficulty of reading the EEG recording. The purpose of this article is to describe the history of awareness during anesthesia and introduce a new processed EEG monitor, the Bispectral Index (BIS) (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Natick, MA) with implications for future clinical use and research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9726194/
9710389,Quantitative EEG correlations with brain glucose metabolic rate during anesthesia in volunteers.,Anesthesiology,1998,Alkire MT,"To help elucidate the relationship between anesthetic-induced changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the concurrent cerebral metabolic changes caused by anesthesia, positron emission tomography data of cerebral metabolism obtained in volunteers during anesthesia were correlated retrospectively with various concurrently measured EEG descriptors.
Volunteers underwent functional brain imaging using the 18fluorodeoxyglucose technique; one scan always assessed awake-baseline cerebral metabolism (n = 7), and the other scans assessed metabolism during propofol sedation (n = 4), propofol anesthesia (n = 4), or isoflurane anesthesia (n = 5). The EEG was recorded continuously during metabolism assessment using a frontal-mastoid montage. Power spectrum variables, median frequency, 95% spectral edge, and bispectral index (BIS) values subsequently were correlated with the percentage of absolute cerebral metabolic reduction (PACMR) of glucose utilization caused by anesthesia.
The percentage of absolute cerebral metabolic reduction, evident during anesthesia, trended median frequency (r = -0.46, P = 0.11), and the spectral edge (r = -0.52, P = 0.07), and correlated with anesthetic type (r = -0.70, P < 0.05), relative beta power (r = -0.60, P < 0.05), total power (r = 0.71,P < 0.01), and bispectral index (r = -0.81,P < 0.001). After controlling for anesthetic type, only bispectral index (r = 0.40, P = 0.08) and alpha power (r = 0.37, P = 0.10) approached significance for explaining residual percentage of absolute cerebral metabolic reduction prediction error.
Some EEG descriptors correlated linearly with the magnitude of the cerebral metabolic reduction caused by propofol and isoflurane anesthesia. These data suggest that a physiologic link exists between the EEG and cerebral metabolism during anesthesia that is mathematically quantifiable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9710389/
9583568,Central nervous system monitoring during open heart surgery: an update.,Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,1998,Sebel PS,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is used to monitor the function of the central nervous system in a variety of surgical procedures. During cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, ischemic changes on the EEG as a result of impaired central nervous system blood supply can be noted. The EEG also may be used to monitor the functional state of the brain during and after profound hypothermic circulatory arrest. If a desired goal is to reduce cerebral metabolism using a barbiturate or other such agent, the EEG can be monitored to provide a measurable pharmacodynamic end point (burst suppression). Techniques have been developed to process the EEG signal using a computer and to improve on-line interpretation. These include fast Fourier transformation to develop a three-dimensional plot or compressed spectral array, evoked-potential monitoring, and bispectral analysis to derive a univariate descriptor of the EEG. These techniques have been used to detect awareness and indirect memory function, as well as to assess the adequacy of anesthesia. There is a good correlation between implicit memory and alterations in midlatency auditory-evoked responses. The bispectral index has been used to assess the adequacy of anesthesia as well as to detect awareness.

Our purpose was to determine whether the non-linear properties of the electroencephalogram (EEG) as defined by the bispectral index was a better predictor of autonomic responses to endotracheal intubation during opioid-based anesthesia than the linear statistical properties of the EEG formulated by power spectral analysis. Thirty-nine adults scheduled for elective non-cranial surgery had a continuous EEG recorded during induction of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia consisted of thiopental and nitrous oxide in oxygen, followed by 1 of 5 randomized opioid dose regimens. The EEG was continuously recorded and blood pressure was measured every minute. All electroencephalographic parameters were derived for the 3 min before and after intubation and were compared to the blood pressure and heart rate responses. Responders were defined by 2 analyses: patients who had a 20% or greater increase (1) in blood pressure or (2) in heart rate to laryngoscopy. Responders and non-responders were compared using Student's unpaired t test, and differences due to dose regimens were examined with logistic regression. Based on the criterion for blood pressure change, there were 27 responders and 12 non-responders. Heart rate changes did not differentiate between the two groups. There was a significant difference between response groups as measured by the bispectral index which distinguished responders from non-responders independently of the amount of drug given. None of the variables of power spectral analysis accurately distinguished responder from non-responder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7511501/
