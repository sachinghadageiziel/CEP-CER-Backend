41249938,Comparison of bispectral index and patient state index during general anesthesia with remimazolam.,BMC anesthesiology,2025,"Shiraishi T, Yahagi M, Yoshida M, Yawata M, Kurokawa H, Tamakawa Y, Kawakita Y, Yaguchi Y","Processed electroencephalographic indices, such as the Bispectral Index (BIS) and Patient State Index (PSI), are widely used to assess anesthetic depth; however, their comparative behavior under remimazolam remains unclear. In practice, either index may deviate from its target range despite stable anesthesia, and the response of the companion monitor is uncertain. This study examined whether the two indices moved in parallel or diverged when one departed from its nominal range during remimazolam anesthesia.
In this prospective, single-center study, BIS and PSI were simultaneously recorded at 21 predefined time points from induction to emergence in 60 adults who received remimazolam-based general anesthesia. Remimazolam was induced at 12 mg/kg/h and maintained at 1 mg/kg/h; all patients received neuromuscular blockade (train-of-four ≤ 1). Two trained observers captured synchronized monitor screenshots and documented the Signal Quality Index, electromyography (EMG), and suppression ratio. Analyses used 994 paired observations: pooled Pearson and repeated-measures correlations, simple linear regression (PSI vs. BIS), repeated-measures Bland-Altman analysis, and a linear mixed-effects model for BIS-PSI differences, including anesthetic phase and EMG as fixed effects and patient as a random intercept.
BIS and PSI showed a strong correlation (r = 0.89) and linear relationship (PSI = 0.936 × BIS - 7.26; R² = 0.79). The repeated-measures Bland-Altman bias was + 10.9 (95% CI 10.3-11.4) with 95% limit of agreement (LoA) - 7.8 to 29.5. Phase-wise modeling showed minimal discrepancies while awake and larger differences during intubation and emergence (Tukey-adjusted p < 0.001), even after EMG adjustment. Both indices tracked the anesthetic depth in parallel but were not numerically interchangeable.
During remimazolam anesthesia, BIS and PSI exhibited parallel temporal trends, indicating shared cortical dynamics despite distinct algorithms. When either index deviated, either elevated or suppressed, the other generally moved in the same direction, reflecting consistent responsiveness rather than device artifacts. Phase-dependent discrepancies and wide agreement limits suggest that each index should be interpreted within its reference framework. Understanding this ""parallel yet nonidentical"" behavior may support context-aware, device-specific depth monitoring.

40683805,Response of the Conox quantitative electroencephalographic monitor to neuromuscular block in awake volunteers.,British journal of anaesthesia,2025,"Schuller PJ, Pretorius JPG, Newbery KB","The Conox monitor analyses the frontal EEG to generate two indices of anaesthetic effects: qCON, intended to indicate the level of consciousness, and qNOX, designed to reflect responsiveness to noxious stimuli. Two similar quantitative EEG devices, BIS and Entropy, have been shown to require muscle activity (EMG) to generate accurate index values in awake individuals. Without EMG, these devices produce misleadingly low values and incorrectly suggest sedation or anaesthesia despite the cortical EEG showing the subjects are awake. As EMG affects frequency bands used by Conox, it too could be incorporating muscle activity to generate high values in awake individuals.
We replayed EEGs recorded during awake paralysis to the Conox monitor via an electronic playback system to test whether it requires EMG to generate accurate values in awake subjects.
Both qCON and qNOX decreased after neuromuscular block to values consistent with sedation or anaesthesia, despite subjects being fully awake. qCON decreased below 60 in 15 of 19 trials, and qNOX decreased below 60 in 11 of 19 trials. Overall, 42% of qCON values during paralysis were <60, the level supposedly indicating anaesthesia.
Conox requires muscle activity to generate accurate values in awake individuals. Consequently, it might be an unreliable indicator of awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking drugs. Studies conducted without neuromuscular block can provide misleading guidance when applied to Conox use in paralysed patients. Clinicians should approach manufacturer guidelines with caution and not rely solely on index values to guide dosing of anaesthetic drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40683805/

If the outflow of irrigation fluid between portals is blocked, it can result in increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, potentially leading to elevated intracranial pressure and related neurological complications. This sudden increase in intracranial pressure may cause transient cerebral hypoperfusion, manifesting as an isoelectric pattern on bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. This study aimed to investigate the use of BIS monitoring as an early indicator of increased intracranial pressure.
BIS monitoring was conducted on patients undergoing UBE surgery to noninvasively detect sudden increases in intracranial pressure. Cases with a follow-up period of less than twelve months were excluded. Intraoperative BIS values of the patients and postoperative neurological complications were retrospectively evaluated.
As of May 2023, BIS monitoring started to be conducted on all patients undergoing UBE surgery in our clinic. Between May and December 2023, 182 levels of endoscopic spinal surgery were performed on 111 patients. The isoelectric BIS pattern was observed intraoperatively in six of these patients. Among them, 1 patient experienced left retinal vein hemorrhage due to increased intracranial pressure. No neurological complications were observed in the remaining five patients.
BIS monitoring is a noninvasive technique that can indicate cerebral hypoperfusion due to sudden increases in intracranial pressure. Thus, BIS monitoring should be considered a valuable tool in the management of patients undergoing UBE spine surgery, aiding in the early detection and appropriate treatment of central nervous system complications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40588185/

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 5,927 older patients (≥ 65 yr of age) who underwent elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia with BIS monitoring between February 2015 and February 2022. We used univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to explore the associations between the cumulative duration of BIS values < 40 and postoperative 1-year mortality. We performed exploratory subgroup and interaction analyses to investigate whether any association with outcome differed in patients with multimorbidity as assessed by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI).
We included 5,927 patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 71 (5) yr. Among them, 2,234 (38%) patients with multimorbidity had a CCI ≥ 3, and 3,693 (62%) had CCI < 3. Postoperatively, 588/5,927 (10%) patients died within 1 year. After adjusting for covariates, multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that the cumulative duration of BIS < 40 was not significantly associated with 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99 to 1.15; P = 0.08); this association remained stable among patients with multimorbidity (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.16).

MéTHODE: Nous avons mené une étude de cohorte rétrospective auprès de 5927 personnes âgées (≥ 65 ans) qui ont bénéficié d’une chirurgie non cardiaque non urgente sous anesthésie générale avec surveillance du BIS entre février 2015 et février 2022. Nous avons utilisé des modèles à risque proportionnel de Cox univariables et multivariables pour explorer les associations entre la durée cumulée de valeurs de BIS < 40 et la mortalité postopératoire à 1 an. Nous avons réalisé des analyses exploratoires de sous-groupe et d’interaction afin de déterminer si une association avec le devenir différait chez les personnes atteintes de multimorbidité telle qu’évaluée par l'Indice de comorbidité de Charlson (CCI). RéSULTATS: Nous avons inclus 5927 personnes bénéficiant d’une chirurgie non cardiaque non urgente, avec un âge moyen (écart type [ET]) de 71 (5) ans. Parmi celles-ci, 2234 (38 %) individus atteints de multimorbidité avait un CCI ≥ 3, et 3693 (62 %) avaient un CCI < 3. En période postopératoire, 588/5927 (10 %) personnes sont décédées dans un délai d’un an.

40279280,The Effect of Electroencephalographic Trajectory During Anesthesia Emergence on the Indices Monitoring the Hypnotic Component.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2026,"Obert DP, Taetow R, Kratzer S, von Dincklage F, García PS, Schneider G, Kreuzer M","Postoperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) are frequent and serious complications that cause an enormous social and economic burden. A previous study demonstrated that certain electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns during emergence from general anesthesia are associated with a higher risk for PND. Compared to patients demonstrating the most favorable trajectory ( Traj Ref : delta-dominant slow-wave anesthesia (ddSWA)→spindle-dominant SWA (sdSWA)→non-SWA (nSWA)→wake), patients presenting Traj Abrupt (ddSWA→wake) had 4-fold increased odds to develop PND and patients with Traj High (nSWA→wake) had 8-fold increased odds of developing PND. We hypothesized that commonly used neuromonitoring devices (state entropy [SE], quantium consciousness index [qCON], bispectral index [BIS], and Patient State Index [PSI]) can differentiate between the various trajectories.
From the original database of the study by Hesse et al, we analyzed 59 EEGs from patients emerging from general anesthesia. They were selected according to their trajectory. We included 19 patients who had shown the most favorable trajectory ( Traj Ref ), 20 who had demonstrated Traj Abrupt , and 20 who had followed Traj High . To evaluate the performance of the neuromonitoring devices, we replayed the patients' EEGs to the monitors using an EEG player. We compared the index values for the 3 different trajectories ( TrajRef , TrajAbrupt , and Traj High ) generated by the different monitoring devices, respectively. Additionally, we evaluated the correlation between the monitoring devices.
SE and PSI were able to resolve significant differences between Traj Ref and Traj Abrupt during a major part of emergence. Traj Ref showed an almost linear increase of index values, whereas Traj Abrupt led to an episode of low index values followed by a sudden increase. However, when comparing Traj Ref vs Traj High , qCON, PSI, and BIS were the indices showing significant differences, especially at the beginning of emergence. Patients representing Traj Ref patterns had significantly lower index values than those depicting TrajHigh . Due to the TrajHigh cases starting in nSWA, their indices were already high at the start of emergence.
Our analysis revealed that the course of the different indices reflects spectral EEG patterns during the emergence from general anesthesia. Considering certain emergence trajectories associated with a higher risk of developing PND, our approach might enable the anesthetist to identify patients particularly susceptible to PND by observing the course of index values before admission to the postanesthesia care unit.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40279280/

To optimize intraoperative analgesic titration, several monitoring devices have been developed, each targeting specific physiologic variables. However, existing devices primarily focus on isolated components of the nociceptive response, such as autonomic or cortical activity, without integrating these perspectives comprehensively. Our aim was to compare the performance of different nociception monitors in response to standardized tetanic stimulation and to investigate the correlation between these monitors' responses and varying concentrations of remifentanil.
In this study, we evaluated and compared the responses of the Nociception Level index (NOL), Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI), Pupillary Reflex Dilation (PRD) and both raw and processed electroencephalogram (EEG) under varying concentrations of propofol and remifentanil. Standardized tetanic stimuli were administered to patients under general anesthesia with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. EEG, PRD, NOL, ANI, heart rate (HR), Bispectral index (BIS), and CONOX monitor indices (qCON and qNOX) were concomitantly recorded.
ANI, BIS, HR, NOL, PRD, and qNOX significantly changed after noxious stimulation. In our dataset, PRD had the strongest correlation with varying remifentanil concentrations, while ANI, NOL, and qNOX did not show significant correlations with remifentanil concentrations. Following a noxious stimulus, the raw EEG in patients with low PRD exhibited a significant increase in power in the high EEG frequencies around 25 Hz and decreased power in frequencies corresponding to the alpha range (8-12 Hz) in the power spectral density.
PRD, HR, and BIS correlated with varying levels of remifentanil, with PRD exhibiting the strongest correlation. When CE remifentanil are low, noxious stimuli are more likely to dilate the pupil and be detected in the EEG. Considering the complexity of the nociceptive response, integrating multimodal neurophysiologic monitoring with pharmacological data may improve the anesthesiologist's ability to assess on the nociception-antinociception balance. However, further studies are needed to validate these findings and address the study's limitations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40220354/

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether use of a BIS monitor to guide sevoflurane administration might reduce the average end tidal sevoflurane concentration used in children 4-18 years of age.
Participants in three age groups (4-8, 9-12, and 13-18 years) were randomized to either the BIS guided group or the control group. Use of sevoflurane as the primary maintenance anesthetic was the only requirement in both arms. In the BIS guided group, sevoflurane was titrated to achieve a target BIS value of 45-60 during the maintenance period. In the control arm, clinicians were blinded to the BIS value. Primary outcome was mean end-tidal sevoflurane concentration during maintenance phase of anesthesia. Secondary assessments included time to discharge and the readiness and quality of recovery as assessed by the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale, the modified Aldrete Score, and the Wong-Baker FACES scale. An intention-to-treat analysis was used to analyze and compare groups.
A total of 180 participants were randomized. Following randomization, 10 participants did not undergo any study procedures, leaving 84 participants in the BIS guided group and 86 participants in the control group. Across all age groups, the average end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was less in the BIS guided group compared to control (4-8 years: 2.2% ± 0.3% vs. 2.4% ± 0.4%, -0.3% [-0.4%, -0.1%]; 9-12 years: 1.7% ± 0.5% vs. 2.1% ± 0.6%, -0.4% [-0.7%, -0.1%]; 13-18 years: 1.6% ± 0.4% vs. 1.9% ± 0.5%, -0.3% [-0.5%, -0.1%]). No differences in recovery outcomes between treatment groups were observed.
In pediatric participants, the BIS guided group reported a lower average end-tidal sevoflurane concentration compared to control, though no significant differences in recovery profile were noted.

However, their reliability in children under 2 years of age remains questionable. During anesthesia maintenance in this age group, processed EEG indices frequently exhibit unexpectedly elevated values that exceed the intended target range.
This study aimed to identify EEG spectral parameters associated with false positive elevations in processed EEG indices and investigate their differences from true positive elevations during emergence.
This prospective observational study included 50 children aged 4-24 months undergoing general anesthesia. Bispectral index (BIS), patient state index (PSi), and raw EEG were continuously recorded throughout anesthesia. False positive was defined as elevated processed EEG indices when end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was maintained at 0.7-1.3 minimum alveolar concentration, with heart rate and mean blood pressure between 80% and 120% of baseline values. We analyzed EEG power spectra and band power values during periods of false positives and compared them with those of true positives during emergence. Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05 was considered significant.
False positives in processed EEG indices were observed in 35 (70%) of the children during anesthesia maintenance, occupying 28% of the maintenance phase. These false positives were associated with decreased power in delta (269-174 dB) and theta (115-97 dB) bands, but widespread increases in alpha and beta bands, resulting in elevated spectral edge frequency (19-22 Hz). Notably, EEG band power during false positives significantly differed from those observed during emergence (delta: 52 dB, theta: 38 dB) (all p < 0.001).

We examine the variability in bispectral index (BIS) scores associated with disconnected conscious and unconscious states as confirmed by a novel serial awakening paradigm.
Seventy adult participants, given propofol or dexmedetomidine, had a cumulative 1381 electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings across two centres. Participants were awakened periodically, and their recent conscious experience interrogated by structured questioning. BIS were reconstructed from EEG using openibis, and the distribution of BIS scores were compared using linear mixed effects modelling. The predictive capacity of BIS across states of consciousness was also examined.
Reconstructed BIS scores correlated significantly with blood concentrations of propofol and dexmedetomidine (all P<0.001). However, while the average BIS was different between baseline wakefulness (mean BIS=95.1 [standard deviation=3.5]); connected consciousness with drug present (84.0 [10.9]); disconnected consciousness (70.0 [16.9]); and unconsciousness (68.1 [16.1]), the interquartile range of these states (3.6, 15.1, 23.3 and 26.8, respectively) indicated high degrees of overlap and individual variability. Connected consciousness could be differentiated from either disconnected consciousness or unconsciousness with 86% accuracy (i.e. 14% error rate), and disconnected consciousness differentiated from unconsciousness with 74% accuracy.
These results agree with previous studies that BIS scores fail to reliably differentiate between states of consciousness, exacerbated by segregating connected, disconnected, and unconscious states. To develop a method that reliably identifies the conscious state of an individual (not an average), work is needed to establish the causal mechanisms of disconnection and unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39665912/

Patients in the ciprofol group (group C) received an intravenous injection of ciprofol (0.3 mg/kg, n=57), while the propofol group (group P) received an intravenous injection of propofol (1.5 mg/kg, n=58). The primary outcome was the incidence of hypotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by > 30% from baseline or MAP< 65 mmHg). Secondary outcomes included induction success rate (bispectral index (BIS) value ≤60 and Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (MOAA/S) score ≤1), injection pain, number of drug additions, time to BIS 60, time to eyelash reflex disappearance, blood pressure changes, incidence of hypertension, tachycardia and BIS values before and after administration.
The incidence of induced hypotension was 26.3% (15/57) in group C and 48.3% (28/58) in group P (OR=0.383, 95% CI:175-0.837, P =0.015). Group C had significantly lower injection pain incidence (5.3% vs 20.7%, OR=0.213, 95% CI: 0.057-0.801, p=0.014). Both groups had a 100% induction success rate, with no significant difference in the number of additional doses. Post-intubation hypertension and tachycardia incidence were not significantly different. Group C showed less blood pressure decrease during induction and a deeper anesthesia level.
Compared to propofol, ciprofol reduces the incidence of induced hypotension in older adults and maintains more stable blood pressure during induction. Additionally, ciprofol reduces injection pain and provides a good depth of anesthesia, making it a safe and effective option for anesthesia induction in older adults.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between the effect-site concentration of ketamine (CeK) and 2 electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived parameters, the BIS and spectral edge frequency (SEF 95 ), after the administration of a ketamine bolus. Secondary aims included investigating the BIS and SEF 95 variations with time and changes in the surgical pleth index (SPI).
We conducted an observational, prospective, single-center study analyzing intraoperative data from 14 adult female patients undergoing breast oncologic surgery. During stable propofol-remifentanil target-controlled infusion (TCI) anesthesia, a ketamine analgesic bolus was delivered with the target CeK set to 1 μg.mL -1 (Domino model) corresponding to a dose of 0.57 mg.kg -1 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.56-0.57 mg.kg -1 ). Once the CeK reached a value of 1 μg.mL -1 , the target CeK was set to 0 μg.mL -1 . We determined the median BIS, SEF 95 , and SPI trends with time and as a function of the modeled CeK.
BIS and SEF 95 showed no significant change from when ketamine was administered to when CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , but a significant increase was observed at lower CeKs. The maximum BIS was reached at 16.0 minutes [10.2-22.7 minutes] after CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , at CeK=0.22 μg.mL -1 [0.12-0.41 μg.mL -1 ]. The peak SEF 95 value was observed at 10.0 minutes [8.62-14.1 minutes] after CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , at CeK=0.43 μg.mL -1 [0.25-0.50 μg.mL -1 ]. No significant association was found between CeK and the registered SPI values.
Our results show that BIS and SEF 95 , but not SPI, follow a CeK-dependent trend after administering a ketamine bolus. Interestingly, their peak values were not reached at CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , but after several minutes after the drug infusion at CeKs in the 0.2 to 0.5 μg.mL -1 range. This may be explained by the specific pharmacodynamics of ketamine and its varying effects at different concentrations, as well as by the time delay associated with the calculation of the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39485729/

In this prospective, randomized controlled trial, our aim was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of employing Index of Consciousness (IoC, IoC1 and IoC2) monitoring in predicting and mitigating circulatory stress induced by endotracheal intubation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients under general anesthesia (GA).
We enrolled one hundred and twenty patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy under GA and randomly allocated them to two groups: IoC monitoring guidance (Group T, n = 60) and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring guidance (Group C, n = 60). The primary endpoints included the heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the patients, as well as the rate of change (ROC) at specific time points during the endotracheal intubation period. Secondary outcomes encompassed the systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), cardiac output index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), ROC at specific time points, the incidence of adverse events (AEs), and the induction dosage of remifentanil and propofol during the endotracheal intubation period in both groups.
The mean (SD) HR at 1 min after intubation under IoC monitoring guidance was significantly lower than that under BIS monitoring guidance (76 (16) beats/min vs. 82 (16) beats/min, P = 0.049, respectively). Similarly, the mean (SD) MAP at 1 min after intubation under IoC monitoring guidance was lower than that under BIS monitoring guidance (90 (20) mmHg vs. 98 (19) mmHg, P = 0.031, respectively). At each time point from 1 to 5 min after intubation, the number of cases with HR ROC of less than 10% in Group T was significantly higher than in Group C (P < 0.05). Furthermore, between 1 and 3 min and at 5 min post-intubation, the number of cases with HR ROC between 20 to 30% or 40% in Group T was significantly lower than that in Group C (P < 0.05). At 1 min post-intubation, the number of cases with MAP ROC of less than 10% in Group T was significantly higher than that in Group C (P < 0.05), and the number of cases with MAP ROC between 10 to 20% in Group T was significantly lower than that in Group C (P < 0.01). Patients in Group T exhibited superior hemodynamic stability during the peri-endotracheal intubation period compared to those in Group C. There were no significant differences in the frequencies of AEs between the two groups (P > 0.05).
This promising monitoring technique has the potential to predict the circulatory stress response, thereby reducing the incidence of adverse reactions during the peri-endotracheal intubation period. This technology holds promise for optimizing anesthesia management.

Predicting and proactively managing hypotension can reduce its incidence. Previously, hypotension prediction algorithms using artificial intelligence were developed for invasive arterial blood pressure monitors. This study tested whether routine non-invasive monitors could also predict intraoperative hypotension using deep learning algorithms.
An open-source database of non-cardiac surgery patients ( https://vitadb.net/dataset ) was used to develop the deep learning algorithm. The algorithm was validated using external data obtained from a tertiary Korean hospital. Intraoperative hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg. The input data included five monitors: non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiography, photoplethysmography, capnography, and bispectral index. The primary outcome was the performance of the deep learning model as assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
Data from 4754 and 421 patients were used for algorithm development and external validation, respectively. The fully connected model of Multi-head Attention architecture and the Globally Attentive Locally Recurrent model with Focal Loss function were able to predict intraoperative hypotension 5 min before its occurrence. The AUROC of the algorithm was 0.917 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.915-0.918) for the original data and 0.833 (95% CI, 0.830-0.836) for the external validation data. Attention map, which quantified the contributions of each monitor, showed that our algorithm utilized data from each monitor with weights ranging from 8 to 22% for determining hypotension.
A deep learning model utilizing multi-channel non-invasive monitors could predict intraoperative hypotension with high accuracy. Future prospective studies are needed to determine whether this model can assist clinicians in preventing hypotension in patients undergoing surgery with non-invasive monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39158783/

Tertiary teaching hospital.
Adult patients undergoing isolated CABG.
Patients were randomly allocated to received either remimazolam (n = 50) or propofol (n = 50) for anesthetic induction. The remimazolam group received an initial infusion at 6 mg/kg/h, which was later adjusted to 1-2 mg/kg/h to maintain a bispectral index of 40-60 after loss of consciousness. In the propofol group, a 1.5 mg/kg bolus of propofol was administered, followed by 1-1.5% sevoflurane inhalation as needed to achieve the target bispectral index.
The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) below the baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) during the first 10 min after anesthetic induction. Secondary outcomes included the AUC for MAP <65 mmHg and the requirement for vasopressors.
The remimazolam group demonstrated a significantly lower AUC under the baseline MAP compared to the propofol group (mean [SD], 169.8 [101.0] mmHg·min vs. 220.6 [102.4] mmHg·min; mean difference [95% confidence interval], 50.8 [10.4-91.2] mmHg·min; P = 0.014).

However, these analyses were potentially confounded by co-administered drugs, in particular opioids and benzodiazepines. Thus, the goal of this prospective study was to characterize the influence of age and weight on the onset of hypnotic effects from propofol, reflected by the time to peak of propofol effect-site concentration in the absence of additional drugs.
A total of 46 healthy children aged 2-12 years presenting for elective surgery were included in our observational cohort study. Solely propofol was administered via a target-controlled infusion pump programmed with the Paedfusor pharmacokinetic model. The BIS and infusion pump data were recorded. The effect of an induction ""bolus"" was recorded having stopped the pump once a propofol plasma target concentration of 7 μg.mL
Time to peak of propofol effect-site concentration had a difference (p-value <.01) for age and weight, that is 84 [74, 96] (median [IQR] secs for children aged 2-6 years vs. 99 [91, 113] secs for children aged 8-12 years and 82 [71, 95] secs for weight 11-25 kg vs. 99 [91, 114] secs for weight 30-63 kg). The plasma effect-site equilibration rate constant for propofol had a heterogeneous distribution with a median of 2.36 (IQR: 2.05-2.93; range: 0.83-7.31) per minute but showed a weight-dependent effect in patients with weight below 45 kg.
In children, the age and weight have an influence on time to peak effect of propofol. In the absence of opioids and benzodiazepines, time to peak effect was approximately 20% longer in children aged 8-12 years as compared to younger children. Such clinically relevant age and weight effects are an important consideration in the individualized titration of propofol dosing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39082130/

Can BIS-guided deep sedation (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale [RASS] score, -4 or -5) reduce sedative dosage and increase delirium-free and coma-free (DFCF) days?
A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary mixed ICU, enrolling patients requiring deep sedation for > 8 h. Patients were assigned randomly to either the clinical assessment (CA) or BIS groups (BIS range, 40-60). Both groups used a BIS sensor, whereas the CA group's screen remained covered. After deep sedation, BIS sensors were removed, and delirium was assessed twice daily by researchers masked to the randomization. The primary outcome was the number of DFCF days within 14 days after deep sedation. Additionally, we compared doses of sedative drugs and BIS values during deep sedation.
Ninety-nine patients were included in the study. We found no significant difference in DFCF days (P = .1) between CA and BIS arms, but propofol doses were significantly lower in the BIS group (CA group, 1.77 mg/kg/h [95% CI, 1.60-1.93] vs BIS group, 1.44 mg/kg/h [95% CI, 1.04-1.83]; P = .03).

This cross-sectional survey on the use of DoA monitors in Norway used a web-based questionnaire distributed to anesthesia personnel in all hospitals in Norway. Participation was voluntary and anonymized, and the web form could not track IP sources or respondents' locations.
Three hundred and ninety-one nurse anesthetists (n = 324) and anesthesiologists (n = 67) responded.

Seventeen patients completed the study. The lowest BIS value in the remimazolam regimen was significantly higher than that in the propofol regimen (p = 0.001). The MMRM analysis of the BIS values revealed significant differences between the regimens at each time point (p < 0.001). The intraoperative diastolic blood pressure and heart rate changes were smaller, the recovery was faster, and there were fewer adverse reactions and less injection pain, but a greater incidence of intraoperative body movement and hiccups, in the remimazolam regimen.

This has sparked further interest into the exploration and evaluation of methods to achieve an optimal cerebrovascular reactivity measure, where the individual patient is exposed to the lowest insult burden of impaired cerebrovascular reactivity. Recent literature has documented, in neural injury populations, the presence of a potential optimal sedation level in neurocritical care, based on the relationship between cerebrovascular reactivity and quantitative depth of sedation (using bispectral index (BIS)) - termed BISopt. The presence of this measure outside of neural injury patients has yet to be proven.

We demonstrate the presence of BISopt in the general anesthesia population (96% of patients), and its absence in awake controls, providing preliminary validation of its existence outside of neural injury populations. Furthermore, we found BIS to be sufficiently separate from overall systemic blood pressure, this indicates that they impact different pathophysiological phenomena to mediate cerebrovascular reactivity.

This is an ongoing debate since more than 25 years, representing a scientific, cultural as well as geographical divide in the anesthesia community. The Pro side argues that total intravenous anesthesia causes less postoperative nausea and higher patient satisfaction than anesthesia using volatile anesthetics. Target-controlled infusion (TCI) of anesthetic agents allows for better titration of intravenous anesthesia using pharmacokinetic models. Processed EEG monitors, such as bispectral index monitoring, allows for better assessing the effect of TCI anesthesia than solely assessment of clinical parameters, such as ECG or blood pressure. The combination of TCI propofol and objective depth of anesthesia monitoring allows creating a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile for each patient. Finally, anesthesia using volatile anesthetics poses health risks for healthcare professionals and contributes to greenhouse effect. The Con side argues that for procedures accompanied with ischemia and reperfusion injury of an organ or tissue and for patients suffering from a severe inflammation' the use of volatile anesthetics might well have its advantages above propofol. In times of sudden shortage of drugs, volatile anesthetics can overcome the restriction in the operating theater or even on the intensive care unit, which is another advantage. Volatile anesthetics can be used for induction of anesthesia when IV access is impossible, end-tidal measurements of volatile anesthetic concentration allows confirmation that patients receive anesthetics. Taking environmental considerations into account, both propofol and volatile anesthetics bear certain harm to the environment, be it as waste product or as greenhouse gases. The authors therefore suggest to carefully considering advantages and disadvantages for each patient in its according environment. A well-balanced choice based on the available literature is recommended. The authors recommend careful consideration of advantages and disadvantages of each technique when tailoring an anesthetic to meet patient needs. Where appropriate, anesthesia providers are encouraged to account for unique features of anesthetic drug behavior, patient-reported and observed postoperative outcomes, and economic and environmental considerations when choosing any of the 2 described techniques.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37590801/

Variational mode decomposition (VMD) searches for IMFs by optimizing the bandwidth to a narrow band with the [Formula: see text] norm while preserving the online estimated central frequency. In this study, we applied VMD to the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during general anesthesia. Using a bispectral index monitor, EEGs were recorded from 10 adult surgical patients (the median age: 47.0, and the percentile range: 27.0-59.3 years) who were anesthetized with sevoflurane. We created an application named EEG Mode Decompositor, which decomposes the recorded EEG into IMFs and displays the Hilbert spectrogram. Over the 30-min recovery from general anesthesia, the median (25-75 percentile range) bispectral index increased from 47.1 (42.2-50.4) to 97.4 (96.5-97.6), and the central frequencies of IMF-1 showed a significant change from 0.4 (0.2-0.5) Hz to 0.2 (0.1-0.3) Hz. IMF-2, IMF-3, IMF-4, IMF-5, and IMF-6 increased significantly from 1.4 (1.2-1.6) Hz to 7.5 (1.5-9.3) Hz, 6.7 (4.1-7.6) Hz to 19.4 (6.9-20.0) Hz, 10.9 (8.8-11.4) Hz to 26.4 (24.2-27.2) Hz, 13.4 (11.3-16.6) Hz to 35.6 (34.9-36.1) Hz, and 12.4 (9.7-18.1) Hz to 43.2 (42.9-43.4) Hz, respectively.

By comparison, the electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrogram enables the visualization of the brain response during anesthesia and may prevent unnecessary anesthetic consumption.
This retrospective study included 140 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy who received total intravenous anesthesia using a combination of propofol and dexmedetomidine infusions. Patients were equally matched to the spectrogram group (maintaining the robust EEG alpha power during surgery) or the index group (maintaining the BIS score between 40 and 60 during surgery) based on the propensity score of age and surgical type. The primary outcome was the propofol dose. Secondary outcome was the postoperative neurological profile.
Patients in the spectrogram group received significantly less propofol (1585 ± 581 vs. 2314 ± 810 mg, P < 0.001). Fewer patients in the spectrogram group exhibited delayed emergence (1.4% vs. 11.4%, P = 0.033). The postoperative delirium profile was similar between the groups (profile P = 0.227).

In this study, we evaluated the values of bispectral index (BIS) and patient state index (PSI) during sevoflurane anesthesia in children. The ability/accuracy of BIS and PSI to predict the maintenance and recovery state of anesthesia was evaluated based on prediction probability (Pk) values and the secondary outcomes were agreement and correlation of 2 monitors. Fifty children (3-12 years old) were enrolled and the patients received sevoflurane anesthesia with remifentanil followed by propofol administration. Before the induction of anesthesia, BIS and PSI sensors were simultaneously placed on the forehead, and data were collected until the end of anesthesia. Maintenance state was defined as the period following intubation until the cessation of sevoflurane, while recovery state was defined as the period following the cessation of sevoflurane until awake. Pk, agreement or correlation of BIS and PSI in different anesthesia state were calculated. Anesthesia reduced mean BIS and PSI values. Pk of BIS (95% confidential interval [CI]: 0.78-0.91) and PSI (95% CI: 0.82-0.91) for anesthesia were 0.85 and 0.87, respectively. Agreement was 0.79 for recovery state and 0.73 for maintenance state. Pk values were comparable for BIS and PSI. Agreement between BIS and PSI measurements in the same state was relatively good.

However, these monitors are vulnerable to artefacts. In addition to the processed number, the raw frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) can be displayed as a curve on the same monitor. Anaesthesia practitioners can learn to interpret the EEG in a short tutorial and may be quicker and more accurate thanBIS in assessing anaesthesia depth by recognising EEG patterns. We hypothesise that quality of recovery (QoR) in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery is better, if propofol is titrated by anaesthesia practitioners able to interpret the EEG.
This is a multicentre, double-blind (patients and outcome assessors) randomised controlled trial taking place in four Swiss hospitals. Patients aged 18 years or older undergoing laparoscopic procedures with general anaesthesia using propofol and anaesthesia practitioners with more than 2 years experience will be eligible. The primary study outcome is the difference in QoR 24 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes are propofol consumption, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and postoperative delirium.QoR and propofol consumption are compared between both groups using a two-sample t-test. Fisher's exact test is used to compare the incidences of PONV and delirium. A total of 200 anaesthesia practitioners (and 200 patients) are required to have an 80% chance of detecting the minimum relevant difference for the QoR-15 as significant at the 5% level assuming a SD of 20.

This technology might be a useful adjunct to clinical observation when titrating sedative medications for palliative care patients. However, the use of BIS in palliative care generally, and in the UK in particular, is under-researched. A key area is this technology's acceptability for palliative care service users. Ahead of trialling BIS in practice, and in order to ascertain whether such a trial would be reasonable, we conducted a study to explore UK palliative care patients' and relatives' perceptions of the technology, including whether they thought its use in palliative care practice would be acceptable.
A qualitative exploration was undertaken. Participants were recruited through a UK hospice. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were conducted with separate groups of palliative care patients, relatives of current patients, and bereaved relatives. We explored their views on acceptability of using BIS with palliative care patients, and analysed their responses following the five key stages of the Framework method.
We recruited 25 participants. There were ten current hospice patients in three focus groups, four relatives of current patients in one focus group and one individual interview, and eleven bereaved relatives in three focus groups and two individual interviews. Our study participants considered BIS acceptable for monitoring palliative care patients' consciousness levels, and that it might be of use in end-of-life care, provided that it was additional to (rather than a replacement of) usual care, and patients and/or family members were involved in decisions about its use. Participants also noted that BIS, while possibly obtrusive, is not invasive, with some seeing it as equivalent to wearable technological devices such as activity watches.
Participants considered BIS technology might be of benefit to palliative care as a non-intrusive means of assisting clinical assessment and decision-making at the end of life, and concluded that it would therefore be acceptable to trial the technology with patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35610644/

To better understand the variation in response of pEEG to these agents, we also compared several EEG derived parameters relevant to pEEG monitoring during emergence. Twenty-four participants scheduled for lithotripsy were randomized to receive xenon or sevoflurane anesthesia. Participants were monitored with the BIS and had simultaneous raw EEG collected. BIS index values were compared at three key emergence timepoints: first response, eyes open and removal of airway. Two sets of EEG derived parameters, three related to the BIS: relative beta ratio, SynchFastSlow and SynchFastSlow biocoherence, and two unrelated to the BIS: spectral edge frequency and the composite cortical state, were calculated for comparison. BIS index values were significantly lower in the xenon group than the sevoflurane group at each emergence timepoint. The relative beta ratio parameter increased significantly during emergence in the sevoflurane group but not in the xenon group. The spectral edge frequency and composite cortical state parameters increased significantly in both groups during emergence. The BIS index is lower at equivalent stages of behavioural response during emergence from xenon anesthesia when compared to sevoflurane anesthesia, most likely due to differences in how these two agents influence the relative beta ratio.

We reviewed electronic medical records of patients with VT who underwent RFCA by general anesthesia from January 2014 to March 2019. According to intraoperative VT induction, they were divided into two groups: non-inducible group (group N) and inducible group (group I). We constructed several multivariable regression models, in which covariates included patient characteristics, comorbidities, protopathy and bispectral index (BIS) value.
One hundred one patients were analyzed. Twenty-nine patients (28.7%) experienced VT no induction, and 26 patients (25.7%) relapsed within 1 year. Compared with group I, the proportion of patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in group N were higher (P < 0.05), and the recurrence rate of VT was significantly higher (51.7% vs 15.3%) (P < 0.05).

Adequacy of the surgical space condition may affect the anesthetists' decision regarding titration of depth of anesthesia. We investigated whether deep neuromuscular blockade reduces the propofol requirement under bispectral index monitoring compared to moderate neuromuscular blockade.
Adult patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery were randomly allocated to a moderate or deep group. A train-of-four count of 1-2 in the moderate group, and a post-tetanic count of 1-2 in the deep group, were maintained by continuous infusion of rocuronium. The induction and maintenance of anesthesia were achieved by target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. The dose of propofol was adjusted to maintain the bispectral index in the range of 40-50. The remifentanil dose was titrated to maintain the systolic blood pressure to within 20% of the ward values.
A total of 82 patients were included in the analyses. The mean±SD dose of propofol was 7.54 ± 1.66 and 7.42 ± 1.01 mg·kg-1·h-1 in the moderate and deep groups, respectively (P = .104). The mean±SD dose of remifentanil was 4.84 ± 1.74 and 4.79 ± 1.77 μg kg-1 h-1 in the moderate and deep groups, respectively (P = .688).

We conducted a prospective observational study of children monitored with a BIS system that received a continuous infusion of vecuronium. We analysed data on clinical, diagnostic and haemodynamic variables, sedatives, analgesics, muscle relaxants, and BIS parameters. We compared BIS parameters before the use of a muscle relaxant, during its administration, before its discontinuation and for the 24h following the end of the infusion.
The analysis included 35 patients (median age, 30 months). The most common diagnosis was heart disease (85%). The most frequent indication for initiation of NMB was low cardiac output (45%), followed by adaptation to mechanical ventilation (20%). Neuromuscular blockade did not produce a significant change in BIS values. We found a decrease was observed in electromyography (EMG) values at 6h (34.9±9.4 vs 31.2±7; P=.008) and 12h after initiation of NMB (34.9±9.4 vs 28.6±4.8; P =.006).

The BIS numerical value, signal quality index, electromyography, suppression ratio, and color density spectral array were continuously recorded. In patients with electroencephalography-confirmed seizures, the mean value and trend (slope of linear regression) of bilateral BIS monitor parameters were analyzed from 1 minute before to 1 minute after seizure onset.
Of 48 patients included in the study, 21 (43.8%) had at least 1 seizure. BIS numerical value was not able to detect focal or focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Considering all seizures, the only significant differences between recordings 1 minute before and 1 minute after seizure onset were a decrease in the signal quality index slope from 1 hemisphere (0.039±0.297 vs. -0.085±0.321, respectively; P =0.029) and in the mean signal quality index recorded from both hemispheres (left hemisphere: 65.775±30.599 vs. 61.032±26.285; P =0.016 and right hemisphere: 63.244±31.985 vs. 59.837±27.360; 0.029); these differences were not maintained after Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons. In seizures occurring during sleep, there was a change in the electromyography slope of 1 hemisphere before and after seizure onset (-0.141±0.176 vs. 0.162±0.140, respectively; P =0.038). There were variable responses in BIS parameters in the 3 patients who developed focal nonconvulsive seizure clusters.

33975095,The influence of age on EEG-based anaesthesia indices.,Journal of clinical anesthesia,2021,"Obert DP, Schweizer C, Zinn S, Kratzer S, Hight D, Sleigh J, Schneider G, García PS, Kreuzer M","In the upcoming years there will be a growing number of elderly patients requiring general anaesthesia. As age is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD) the incidence of POD will increase concordantly. One approach to reduce the risk of POD would be to avoid excessively high doses of anaesthetics by using neuromonitoring to guide anaesthesia titration. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of patient's age on various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based anaesthesia indices.
We conducted an analysis of previously published data by replaying single electrode EEG episodes of maintenance of general anaesthesia from 180 patients (18-90 years; ASA I-IV) into the five different commercially available monitoring systems and evaluated their indices. We included the State/Response Entropy, Narcotrend, qCON/qNOX, bispectral index (BIS), and Treaton MGA-06. For a non-commercial comparison, we extracted the spectral edge frequency (SEF) from the BIS. To evaluate the influence of the age we generated linear regression models. We also assessed the correlation between the various indices.
During anaesthetic maintenance the values of the SEF, State/Response Entropy, qCON/qNOX and BIS all significantly increased (0.05 Hz/0.19-0.26 index points per year) with the patient's age (p < 0.001); whereas the Narcotrend did not change significantly with age (0.06 index points per year; p = 0.28). The index values of the Treaton device significantly decreased with age (-0.09 index points per year; p < 0.001). These findings were independent of the administered dose of anaesthetics.
Almost all current neuromonitoring devices are influenced by age, with the potential to result in inappropriately high dosage of anaesthetics. Therefore, anaesthesiologists should be aware of this phenomenon, and the next generation of monitors should correct for these changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33975095/

Many studies have shown that surgical anesthesia may cause POCD, especially in elderly patients. This article aims to study the relationship between artificial intelligence-based general anesthetics and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This article first describes and classifies artificial intelligence, introduces its realization method, machine learning algorithms, and briefly introduces the basic principles of regression and classification methods in machine learning; then, the principles and techniques of general anesthetics are proposed. The pathogenesis of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is explained in detail. Finally, the effect of anesthetics on postoperative cognitive dysfunction is obtained from both inhaled anesthetics and intravenous anesthetics. The impact on postoperative cognitive function is explained. The experimental results in this article show that there is no statistically significant difference in the two groups of patients' age, gender ratio, body mass index, education level, preoperative comorbidities, and other general indicators. Through the use of EEG bispectral index monitors to monitor the depth of anesthesia and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, first, there was no obvious relationship between the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction at 1, 5, 10, and 50 days and discharge time. The comprehensive monitoring group can reduce the clinical dose of preventive medication and cis-atracurium and shorten the patient's recovery time, extubation time, and recovery time.

A number of studies have used such recordings for analysis, even though information about bandwidth and fidelity has not been provided by the manufacturers. In this study we consider these systems purely as EEG recording devices, and evaluate their suitability for quantitative analysis. Using a calibrated electronic testing system, we played an artificial test signal of known amplitude with frequency varying from 0.01 to 400 Hz into the BIS and Entropy EEG systems, and saved the recording in each of their supported recording modes. The amplitude of the recording at each frequency was then used to derive the frequency response curves, as well as the 3 dB and 0.5 dB points for each mode. There are important differences between the various BIS and Entropy recordings. The BIS 256 Hz and the Entropy 400 Hz recordings are broadly comparable, although Entropy has a slightly reduced response above 50 Hz and below 1 Hz. The BIS 128 Hz recording has a somewhat reduced bandwidth, due to its relatively low sampling rate. The Entropy 100 Hz recording in the Datex-Ohmeda S/5 monitor has a flawed implementation, leading to aliasing of signals over 50 Hz and potential distortion of the recording, while in the GE Carescape it has an uneven response and a narrowed bandwidth. Consequently, it is important to know which specific host monitor was used when an Entropy 100 Hz recording was made. In summary, the choice of recording device and host monitor may affect the results of some quantitative EEG analysis, and some previously published studies may need to be re-evaluated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33860876/

The BIS, BISpro, heart rate, target-concentration of propofol and Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score were recorded every 30 s in female patients scheduled for hysteroscopic surgery. Propofol anaesthesia was induced by an initial target-controlled concentration (1.0 μg/ml) followed by a stepwise increase (0.5 μg/ml) until the patient was unresponsive. Spearman's correlation coefficient and prediction probability were calculated for the association between sedation levels and the above parameters. The ability of investigated parameters to distinguish between OAA/S scores was analysed. Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare the agreement between BIS and BISpro. The BIS and BISpro cut-off values for lost response were also determined.
Out of 30 patients in total, a high correlation was found between BIS and BISpro, and both correlated well with OAA/S score. Only BIS was able to distinguish all investigated OAA/S states accurately, but the ability to predict OAA/S score 5 to loss of response was comparable between BIS and BISpro.

We used the bispectral index (BIS) to guide the regulation of end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (ETsevo). The mean ETsevo from 20 minutes after endotracheal intubation to 2 hours after the start of surgery was calculated for all patients. Differential sevoflurane requirements were identified according to ETsevo. The BIS, ETsevo, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, dose of sufentanil and cisatracurium, tracheal extubation time, incidence of intraoperative awareness, and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting were compared between patients with a low requirement for sevoflurane (group L) and patients with a high requirement for sevoflurane (group H).The mean ETsevo of the 390 patients was 1.55% ± 0.26%.

Literature suggests that current treatments administered in TBI care, in the intensive care unit (ICU), fail to greatly impact recorded cerebrovascular reactivity measures. In particular, the impact of sedation on cerebrovascular reactivity in traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unclear in vivo. The goal of this study was to preliminarily assess the relationship between objectively measured depth of sedation and cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI.
Within, we describe a case series of 5 adult TBI patients with TBI, during which objective high-frequency physiology for sedation depth, using bispectral index (BIS), and both intracranial pressure (ICP) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) were recorded. Pressure reactivity index (PRx) and RAP (a metric of cerebral compensatory reserve) were derived. Relationships between cerebrovascular reactivity and compensatory reserve monitoring with BIS metrics were explored using descriptive plots.
A total of 5 cases in our prospectively maintained database with high-frequency physiology for ICP, ABP, and BIS. Through error bar plotting, it can be seen that each patient displays a parabolic relationship between BIS and PRx. This suggests a potential ""optimal"" depth of sedation where cerebrovascular reactivity is the most intact.
This small series highlights the potential impact of depth of sedation on cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI. It suggests that there may be an individual optimal depth of sedation, so as to optimize cerebrovascular reactivity.

However, quantification of noxious stimuli that occur under general anaesthesia is a constant challenge for anaesthesiologists, and recently two new indices have been developed to assess intra-operative nociception.
The aim of this study was to quantify with new indices as well as with more classical clinical parameters the antinociceptive effect of N2O during general anaesthesia.
Prospective, open label, patient-blinded, observational and descriptive trial.
Single-centre academic hospital.
Forty American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status 1 to 3 patients undergoing general anaesthesia for elective abdominal surgery via laparotomy were recruited.
Intra-operative pain was assessed using a standardised electrical stimulation of the forearm (tetanic stimulation at 70 mA, 100 Hz for 30 s), at 0, 25 and 50% inhaled N2O/O2. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure, bispectral index, the analgesia nociception index and the nociception level (NOL) index were used to evaluate intra-operative nociception before and after each standardised tetanic stimulation.
There was a 16% reduction of the analgesia nociception index reaction, a 31% reduction of the NOL reaction and a 51% reduction of the HR reaction to a standardised electrical tetanic nociceptive stimulation during administration of 50% N2O. Administration of 50 or 25% inhaled N2O produced the same quality of antinociception based on HR and NOL index analyses. HR and the NOL index were the best parameters to identify the antinociceptive effect of intra-operatively administered N2O.
In anaesthetised patients, our study demonstrated clinically significant antinociceptive properties of N2O. Our results showed that low concentrations of N2O (25%) are as effective as higher concentrations (50%) to achieve a significant antinociceptive effect. These findings may help decrease negative effects of using higher concentrations of N2O, including its side effects and its environmental pollution.

Despite attempts to infer its algorithms by external observation, its operation has nevertheless remained undescribed, in contrast to the algorithms of other less commercially successful monitors of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity under anesthesia. With the expiration of certain key patents, the time is therefore ripe to examine the operation of the monitor on its own terms through careful dismantling, followed by extraction and examination of its internal software.
An A-2000 BIS Monitor (gunmetal blue case, amber monochrome display) was purchased on the secondary market. After identifying the major data processing and storage components, a set of free or inexpensive tools was used to retrieve and disassemble the monitor's onboard software. The software executes primarily on an ARMv7 microprocessor (Sharp/NXP LH77790B) and a digital signal processor (Texas Instruments TMS320C32). The device software can be retrieved directly from the monitor's hardware by using debugging interfaces that have remained in place from its original development.
Critical numerical parameters such as the spectral edge frequency (SEF), total power, and BIS values were retraced from external delivery at the device's serial port back to the point of their calculation in the extracted software. In doing so, the locations of the critical algorithms were determined. To demonstrate the validity of the technique, the algorithms for SEF and total power were disassembled, comprehensively annotated and compared to their theoretically ideal behaviors. A bug was identified in the device's implementation of the SEF algorithm, which can be provoked by a perfectly isoelectric EEG.
This article demonstrates that the electronic design of the A-2000 BIS Monitor does not pose any insuperable obstacles to retrieving its device software in hexadecimal machine code form directly from the motherboard. This software can be reverse engineered through disassembly and decompilation to reveal the methods by which the BIS monitor implements its algorithms, which ultimately must form the definitive statement of its function. Without further revealing any algorithms that might be considered trade secrets, the manufacturer of the BIS monitor should be encouraged to release the device software in its original format to place BIS-related academic literature on a firm theoretical foundation and to promote further academic development of EEG monitoring algorithms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33093360/

Relation between these sources should be time independent, that is, perfectly synchronized. In reality, various issues corrupt time independency, leading to asynchrony or, in other words, hysteresis. This asynchrony can lead to conflicting information, making effective drug dosing challenging. In this study, we tried to quantify and minimize the hysteresis between the Ceprop (calculated using the Schnider model for propofol) and EEG measured drug effect, using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM). Further, we measured the influence of EEG-based monitor choice, namely Bispectral index (BIS) versus qCON index (qCON) monitor, on propofol PD hysteresis.
We analyzed the PD data from 165 patients undergoing propofol-remifentanil anesthesia for outpatient surgery. Drugs were administered using target-controlled infusion (TCI) pumps. Pumps were programmed with Schnider model for propofol and Minto model for remifentanil. We constructed 2 PD models (direct models) relating the Schnider Ceprop to the measured BIS and qCON monitor values. We quantified the models' misspecification due to hysteresis, on an individual level, using the root mean squared errors (RMSEs). Subsequently, we optimized the PD models' predictions by adding a lag term to both models (lag-time PD models) and quantified the optimization using the RMSE.
There is a counterclockwise hysteresis between Ceprop and BIS/qCON values. Not accounting for this hysteresis results in a direct PD model with an effect-site concentration which produces 50% of the maximal drug effect (Ce50) of 6.24 and 8.62 µg/mL and RMSE (median and interquartile range [IQR]) of 9.38 (7.92-11.23) and 8.41(7.04-10.2) for BIS and qCON, respectively. Adding a modeled lag factor of 49 seconds to the BIS model and 53 seconds to the qCON model improved both models' prediction, resulting in similar Ce50 (3.66 and 3.62 µg/mL for BIS and qCON) and lower RMSE (median (IQR) of 7.87 (6.49-9.90) and 6.56 (5.28-8.57) for BIS and qCON.
There is a significant ""Ceprop versus EEG measured drug effect"" hysteresis. Not accounting for it leads to conflicting PD information and false high Ce50 for propofol in both monitors. Adding a lag term improved the PD model performance, improved the ""pump-monitor"" synchrony, and made the estimates of Ce50 for propofol more realistic and less monitor dependent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32925339/
32833715,"Relationship Between Propofol Target Concentrations, Bispectral Index, and Patient Covariates During Anesthesia.",Anesthesia and analgesia,2021,"Schnider TW, Minto CF, Egan TD, Filipovic M","Internationally, propofol is commonly titrated by target-controlled infusion (TCI) to maintain a processed electroencephalographic (EEG) parameter (eg, bispectral index [BIS]) within a specified range. The overall variability in propofol target effect-site concentrations (CeT) necessary to maintain adequate anesthesia in real-world conditions is poorly characterized, as are the patient demographic factors that contribute to this variability. This study explored these issues, hypothesizing that the variability in covariate-adjusted propofol target concentrations during BIS-controlled anesthesia would be substantial and that most of the remaining interpatient variability in drug response would be due to random effects, thus suggesting that the opportunity to improve on the Schnider model with further demographic data is limited.
With ethics committee approval and a waiver of informed consent, a deidentified, high-resolution, intraoperative database consisting of propofol target concentrations, BIS values, and vital signs from 13,239 patients was mined to identify patients who underwent general endotracheal anesthesia using propofol (titrated to BIS), fentanyl, remifentanil, and rocuronium that lasted at least 1 hour. The propofol target concentrations and BIS values 30 minutes after incision (CeT30 and BIS30) were considered representative of stable intraoperative conditions. The data were plotted and analyzed by descriptive statistics. Confidence intervals were computed using a bootstrap method. A linear model was fit to the data to test for correlation with factors of interest (eg, age and weight).
A total of 4584 patients met inclusion criteria and were entered into the analysis. Of the propofol target concentrations, 95% were between 1.5 and 3.5 µg·mL-1. Higher BIS30 values were correlated with higher propofol concentrations. Except for age, all the patient-related variables analyzed entered the regression model linearly. Only 10.2% of the variability in CeT30 was explained by the patient factors of age and weight combined.
Our hypothesis was confirmed. The variability in covariate-adjusted propofol CeT30 titrated to BIS in real-world conditions is considerable, and only a small portion of the remaining variability in drug response is explained by patient demographic factors. This finding may have important implications for the development of new pharmacokinetic (PK) models for propofol TCI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32833715/

The partial correlation coefficient prior to the loss of consciousness was 0.838 (P < .001), and 0.669 (P < .001) following the loss of consciousness. Intra-class correlation between the 2 indices was 0.889 (P < .001) and 0.791 (P < .001) prior and following the loss of consciousness, respectively.PLE exhibited a strong and predictable correlation with both BIS and OAA/S scores.

It consists of performing the thyroidectomy through its natural orifice, using three ports in the oral vestibular area and carrying out a careful dissection to the sternal notch and the edges of both sternocleidomastoid muscles. The objective of this article is to describe the different anesthetic implications that this surgical technique entails, given that the evidence published to date in the literature is very limited. It is considered essential to control the recurrent laryngeal nerve using an endotracheal tube with electromyography to ensure its identification and integrity, as well as the use of other monitors such as the TOF watch or the bispectral index to ensure adequate anesthetic depth and an optimal level of muscle relaxation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32622475/

Following informed consent baseline mini-mental status exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and geriatric depression scale (GDS) were obtained. Intraoperatively OAA/S, BIS, and propofol (timing and exact amounts) administered were recorded. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected for Alzheimer's (AD) biomarkers. Mean Ce level (AvgCe) during surgery was calculated using the area under the Ce measurement series from incision to closure, divided by surgical time. Average OAA/S (AvgOAA/S), and BIS (AvgBIS) were similarly calculated. Pearson correlations of AvgCe with AvgOAA/S and AvgBIS were calculated overall and by CDR. Nonparametric locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) fits of AvgOAA/S and AvgBIS on AvgCe were produced, stratified by CDR. Multivariable regression incorporating baseline cognitive measurements or AD biomarkers assessed AvgOAA/S or AvgBIS associations with AvgCe.
In 186 participants AvgBIS and AvgOAA/S correlated with AvgCe (Pearson ρ = - 0.72; p < 0.0001 and Pearson ρ = - 0.81; p < 0.0001, respectively), and remained unchanged across CDR levels. Association patterns of AvgOAA/S or AvgBIS on AvgCe guided by LOWESS fits and modeled through regression, were similar when stratified by CDR (p = 0.16). Multivariable modeling found no independent effect on AvgBIS or AvgOAA/S by MMSE, CDR, GDS, or AD biomarkers after accounting for AvgCe.

In addition, there is a shift of alpha activity from parieto-occipital to frontal zones, defined as anteriorization. Whilst monitoring LOC and anteriorization would be useful to improve propofol dosage and patient safety, the current devices for anesthetic depth monitoring are unable to detect these events. The aim of this study was to observe LOC and anteriorization during anesthesia induction with propofol by applying electrodes placed in the frontal and parietal areas. Bispectral index (BIS) and quantium consciousness index (qCON) monitors were simultaneously employed. BIS™ and qCON sensors were placed in the frontal and parieto-occipital regions of 10 alopecic patients who underwent anesthesia with propofol, alfentanil, and remifentanil. The initial biophase target of propofol was 2.5 mcg/mL which was gradually increased until reaching LOC. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to study differences in alpha power and qCON/BIS indices along the study; and Pk value to evaluate predictive capability of anteriorization of BIS, qCON, and alpha waves. Parietal BIS and qCON values became significantly higher than frontal values 15 min after loss of eye reflex. Anteriorization was observed with both monitors.

There are few options for pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of propofol for children under two years old. We performed an external validation of the Kim model for children under two years old to evaluate whether the model is applicable to this age group.
Twenty-four children were enrolled. After routine anesthetic induction, a continuous infusion of 2% propofol and remifentanil was commenced using the Kim model. The target effect-site concentration of propofol was set as 2, 3, 4, and 5 μg/mL, followed by arterial blood sampling after 10 min of each equilibrium. Population estimates of four parameters-pooled bias, inaccuracy, divergence, and wobble-were used to evaluate the performance of the Kim model.
A total of 95 plasma concentrations were used for evaluation of the Kim model. The population estimate (95% confidence interval) of bias was -0.96% (-8.45%, 6.54%) and that of inaccuracy was 21.0% (15.0%-27.0%) for the plasma concentration of propofol.
The pooled bias and inaccuracy of the pharmacokinetic predictions are clinically acceptable. Therefore, our external validation of the Kim model indicated that the model can be applicable to target-controlled infusion of propofol in children younger than 2 years, with the recommended use of actual bispectral index monitoring in clinical settings that remifentanil is present.

In this single-center, patient-and-evaluator-blinded, two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled, superiority study, 90 patients having noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the control group, anesthesia management was performed manually while in the closed-loop group, the titration of anesthesia, analgesia, fluids, and ventilation was performed by three independent controllers.

Secondary outcomes included a battery of neurocognitive tests completed at both 1 week and 3 months postsurgery as well as 30-day postsurgical outcomes.

In this study, we hypothesized that preoperative pregabalin reduces inhaled isoflurane requirements.
We investigated the effectiveness of preoperative oral pregabalin 150 mg in women undergoing elective open total abdominal hysterectomy under general anesthesia. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study was conducted in a university hospital. The study included 50 women (18-60 yrs.), ASA I or II, admitted for abdominal hysterectomy under general anesthesia. Exclusion criteria were allergy to pregabalin; calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic drugs, antidepressant drugs, any analgesics, sedatives, or oral hypoglycemic agents. Patients were randomized into two groups; Pregabalin group received oral pregabalin 150 mg and placebo group. Main outcome measures was inhaled isoflurane requirements to maintain hemodynamics ±20% of baseline and bispectral index of 40 - 60, measured using MAQUET Flow-I anesthetic machine. Secondary outcomes were attenuation of pressor response to intubation, postoperative pain, and first time for rescue analgesia, total analgesics and adverse effects.
Isoflurane consumption was significantly less in pregabalin group (7.80±1.27 mL h -1) versus (12.27±2.49 mL h-1) in the control group, (P=0.00). Better hemodynamic stability was in pregabalin group. First postoperative hour: the mean VAS Score was significantly higher in control group (7.10±1.20) compared to pregabalin group (4.50±1.70), P<0.001. More dizziness was in pregabalin group.

This study was performed to evaluate the performance of PLE for assessing the depth of sedation.
Thirty adult patients undergoing upper limb surgery with a brachial plexus block were administered propofol by target-controlled infusion. The depth of sedation was assessed using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale. The effect-site concentration (Ce) of propofol was initially started at 0.5 μg/ml and was increased in increments of 0.2 μg/ml until an OAA/S score of 1 was reached. Three minutes after the target Ce was reached, the PLE, bispectral index (BIS), and level of sedation were assessed. Correlations between the OAA/S score and PLE or BIS were determined. The prediction probabilities (Pk) of PLE and BIS were also analyzed.
The PLE values were closely correlated with the OAA/S scores (Spearman's Rho = 0.755; P < 0.001) to an extent comparable with the correlation between the BIS and OAA/S score (Spearman's Rho = 0.788; P < 0.001). The Pk values of PLE and BIS were 0.731 and 0.718, respectively.

The increase in entropy and BIS values is most likely caused by increased EMG activity and a higher level of consciousness. A strong EMG activity can increase entropy and BIS values because it is impossible to separate electroencephalography (EEG) from EMG, and this results from their overlapping power spectra. Thus, the entropy module may be more affected by EMG compared with the BIS module because it has more overlap with the power spectra of EEG and EMG. Several studies have suggested that EMG activity is most likely to increase, especially as it relates to the level of total intravenous anesthesia without a muscle relaxant or an insufficient analgesic level, which results in falsely increased entropy values. We present the case of a patient whose entropy values were falsely elevated by increased EMG activity resulting from light neuromuscular block or nociceptive stimuli during surgery even when undergoing desflurane anesthesia. This was closely related to the change in the neuromuscular block level and it was influenced by the degree of analgesia and the remifentanil infusion rate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31342813/

One possible reason is that the reverse of neuromuscular blockade affects electromyographic (EMG) signals of fascial muscle. Another reason is, the afferentation theory, the reverse of neuromuscular blockade relieves block signals generated in muscle stretch receptors from accessing the brain through afferent nerve pathways and induces arousal. Inaccurate BIS value may lead to overdose of drugs or the risk of intraoperative awareness. We compared changes in BIS and EMG values according to neuromuscular blockade reversal agents under steady-state desflurane anesthesia. A total of 65 patients were randomly allocated to receive either neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg, sugammadex 4 mg/kg, or pyridostigmine 0.25 mg/kg for neuromuscular blockade reversal under stable desflurane anesthesia, and 57 patients completed the study. The primary outcome was change in BIS and EMG values before and after administration of neuromuscular blockade reversal agents (between train-of-four [TOF] count 1-2 and TOF ratio 0.9).

Phase lag entropy (PLE) reflects DOA by calculating diverse connectivity from temporal patterns of phase relationships. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of PLE and bispectral index (BIS) monitors for assessing DOA during anesthesia induction, nerve integrity monitoring (NIM), and anesthesia emergence.
Thirty-five patients undergoing elective thyroid surgery with recurrent laryngeal nerve NIM received propofol and remifentanil via target-controlled infusion. After applying PLE and BIS monitors, propofol infusion was initiated at a calculated effect site concentration (Ce) of 2 μg/mL and then increased in 1-μg/mL Ce increments. After propofol Ce reached 5 μ/mL, a remifentanil infusion was begun, and anesthesia induction was considered complete. During NIM, PLE and BIS values were compared at a specific time points from platysma muscle exposure to subcutaneous tissue closure. PLE and BIS values were recorded continuously from preanesthetic state to full recovery of orientation; bias and limits of agreement between monitors were calculated.
PLE and BIS values decreased progressively with increasing propofol Ce during anesthetic induction and increased by stages during emergence. The prediction probabilities of PLE and BIS for detecting propofol Ce changes were 0.750 and 0.756, respectively, during induction and 0.749 and 0.746, respectively, during emergence. No aberrant PLE or BIS values occurred during NIM. Correlation coefficients for BIS and PLE were 0.98 and 0.92 during induction and emergence, respectively. PLE values were significantly higher than BIS values at full recovery of orientation. Estimated bias between monitors was -4.16 ± 8.7, and 95% limits of agreement were -21.21 to 12.89.
PLE is a reasonable alternative to BIS for evaluating consciousness and DOA during general anesthesia and during NIM.

In 163 patients, propofol was administered using a CL system (BIS target [BISTARGET] between 40 and 50). Initial CeREMI targets between 2 and 7.5 ng/mL were selected as deemed clinically required. Performance parameters during induction were the time required to initially cross the target BIS, the time required to reach the maximal drug effect after induction (TPEAK, BIS) and the corresponding BIS at this moment, and the time required to regain the target BIS at the end of induction. Performance during maintenance was defined as the percentage of case time with target BIS ± 10 from target and the amount of performance error (PE) between the observed and target BIS values and its derived median PE (MDPE) as a measure of control bias, median absolute PE (MDAPE) as a measure of control inaccuracy, divergence as a measure of the time-related trend of the measured BIS values relative to the target BIS values, and wobble as a measure of intrasubject variability in prediction error. The secondary end point was the hemodynamic stability of the patient during CL control.
The applied CL system induced and maintained anesthesia within clinically accepted ranges. The percentage of case time [mean (standard deviation [SD]) across all study participants] with BIS ± 10 from the target was 82% (14%). The mean (SD) population MDPE and MDAPE were -6.6% (5.5%) and 11.2% (5.5%), respectively. A negative divergence [-0.001 (0.004)] and acceptable wobble [9.7% (4.0%)] were found. The correlation between the system PE and CeREMI was low and only influenced by a CeREMI <2.8 ng/mL. Hemodynamic stability stayed within the clinically acceptable range.
The applied CL system for propofol administration has an acceptable performance in the CeREMI range of 2.8-7.5 ng/mL during the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. There was no evidence of a strong association between CeREM and the CL performance. This study also shows that when the CeREMI is <2.8 ng/mL, it might be more challenging to prevent arousal during propofol anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31107260/

MATERIAL AND METHODS In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled adult spontaneous ICH patients after surgical hematoma evacuation who did not recover consciousness on the first postoperative day. After patient enrollment, the BIS was continuously monitored for 12 hours, and the motor response on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS-M) was evaluated. The patients were followed up for 30 days and divided into a consciousness recovery group and a nonrecovery group. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to investigate the predictive values of the BIS, GCS-M and ICH score on the consciousness recovery. The area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated. During the 12-hour monitoring period, the peak BIS value after GCS-M stimulation was used for ROC analysis. RESULTS Of the 55 enrolled patients, 19 patients recovered consciousness, and 36 patients did not. The BIS value of the consciousness recovery group was significantly higher than that of the nonrecovery group (P<0.001). For consciousness recovery prediction, the AUC (95%CI) of the BIS values after external stimulation was 0.97 (0.91-1.00), which was superior to the GCS-M (0.75 [0.59-0.91]) and ICH score (0.57 [0.41-0.73]).

The challenge of anesthesia is to maintain a calm, comfortable, and cooperative patient during the mapping phase. Response surface models (RSMs) are multidrug modeling algorithms. In this pharmacodynamic study, we investigate the first use of RSM with bispectral index (BIS) to predict patient's response to name calling (RNC) and wakefulness (complete neurological tests) during AC.
The study is performed in two phases. We prospectively enrolled 40 patients who received video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) using propofol and fentanyl as the modeling group. Effect-site concentrations (Ce) and BIS values were recorded and a RSM is built from the data set. We verified the RSM retrospectively in AC patients, designated as the validation group. Corresponding BIS values were analyzed for RNC and wakefulness.
A total of 155 data sets of propofol Ce, fentanyl Ce, and BIS pairs were available for modeling. The range of propofol and fentanyl Ce were 0 to 9.95 μg/mL and 0 to 3.69 ng/mL, respectively. Observed BIS ranged from 21 to 98. The model identified an additive interaction between propofol and an opioid. RNC at BIS 64 is predicted by the model and 70 is required for wakefulness.
RSM built from VATS patients is verified with a separate group of AC patient. The BIS target advised for RSM-predicted wakefulness is 70. The model illustrates the timeline to wakefulness during AC under propofol and an opioid.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BIS with clinical signs for titration of sedation depth during endoscopy were screened and identified if they reported one of the following outcome measures: intraprocedual safety (hemodynamic stability and cardiorespiratory complications such as hypoxia, hypertension/hypotension, and bradycardia/tachycardia), procedure duration, recovery time and patient/endoscopist's satisfaction.
Twelve studies with 13 RCTs recruiting 1372 patients were identified with great inter-trial heterogeneity. Meta-analysis found that BIS monitoring of sedation depth was associated with lower incidences of intraprocedural hypoxia (P=0.009) compared with clinical signs which was not confirmed by TSA. Meta-analysis and TSA found that the endoscopic procedure duration (P=0.143), recovery time (P=0.083), satisfaction scores from both the cases (P=0.085) and endoscopists (P=0.125) and the incidences of hypertension/ hypotension (P=0.639) or heart rates (P=0.201) were similar between BIS and control group.
More high-quality large-sampled RCTs are needed to confirm whether BIS monitoring for endoscopy sedation helps reduce intraprocedural hypoxia. BIS monitoring fails to shorten procedure duration, promote recovery or boost satisfaction among patients and endoscopists.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30621373/

However, its effect on intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IOM) during brain tumor surgery remains controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of DEX on IOM during brain tumor surgery.
Seventy-eight consecutive patients (DEX group, n = 40; control group, n = 38), who underwent brain tumor surgery with IOM, were retrospectively reviewed. The outcomes included the predictability, laterality of alterations, and stimulation parameters of transcranial motor evoked potentials (tcMEPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs).
The predictability of tcMEPs for postoperative motor outcomes showed a higher false-positive rate in the DEX group than in the control group (27.5% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.047). Bilateral alterations were observed only in the DEX group (31.3%; P = 0.053). Compared with the control group, the DEX group required significantly higher intensity (377.5 ± 48.0 vs. 347.1 ± 30.0 mV; P = 0.001) and repetition rate (6.0 ± 0.2 vs. 5.7 ± 0.5 pulse/train; P = 0.001) of transcranial electric stimulation to evoke adequate tcMEPs. The SSEP results were comparable between both groups. In the DEX group, false-positive tcMEPs changes occurred 222.2 ± 70.5 minutes (range, 95-342 minutes) after the induction of anesthesia. In addition, the patients who were administered DEX under bispectral index monitoring (n = 12) showed a significantly higher false-positive rate than shown by the control group (50.5% vs. 5.3%; P = 0.003).
This study showed that DEX had significant effects on tcMEPs during IOM in brain tumor surgery. Because the high false-positive rate could decrease the accuracy of IOM, outcomes after using DEX should be cautiously interpreted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30496923/

To face the delay in the hypnosis control, we have proposed a proportional-integral (PI) controller with a Smith predictor (PI+Smith). We have evaluated the feasibility of this closed-loop control for propofol administration and compared the performance with manual administration guided by the Bispectral Index (BIS).
Fifty-seven adult patients under TIVA with propofol and remifentanil were randomly assigned to a PI+Smith or a manual control (MC) group. The BIS target was set to 50. The performance was compared through the global score (GS), median performance error (MDPE), median absolute performance error (MDAPE), offset and Wobble.
A total of 29 patients in the MC and 25 in the PI+Smith groups completed this study. Performance was significantly better in the PI+Smith group: global score was 25 (19 to 37) for PI+Smith versus 44 (32 to 57) for MC (P<0.001); MDPE was -0.9 (-5.6 to 2) for PI+Smith versus -11 (-16 to -4.3) for MC (P<0.001); MDAPE was 10.8 (8.8 to 14.3) for PI+Smith versus 17 (12.8 to 19.2) for MC (P<0.001); offset was -0.6 (-3.2 to 0.06) for PI+Smith versus -3.7 (-7.0 to -0.8) for MC (P=0.01). The percentage time of BIS within the 40-60 range during the maintenance phase was higher in the PI+Smith group 80.8 (68.7 to 87.9) than in the MC group 59.1 (53.4 to 72.5) (P<0.001).
The use of a specific mechanism in the PI controller to deal with the delay outperformed satisfactorily manual practice.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of BIS monitoring during surgery for resection of colon carcinoma in elderly patients using the Attention Network Test (ANT) to study alerting, orienting, and executive functions, and the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). MATERIAL AND METHODS Eighty-one patients (65-75 years) underwent radical surgery for colon carcinoma with general intravenous anesthesia, propofol (6-8 mg/kg/h), vecuronium (0.03-0.05 mg/kg/min), and remifentanil (0.1-0.2 μg/kg/min). The BIS group (n=41) underwent adjustment of anesthesia to maintain a BIS value between 40-60; the non-BIS group (N=40) underwent standard intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring. Primary endpoints were alerting, orienting, and executive functions assessed pre-operatively and on postoperative days 1 and 5 using the ANT; the secondary endpoint was delirium during the first five postoperative days, assessed using the CAM. RESULTS Propofol and remifentanil doses were significantly lower in the BIS group compared with the non-BIS group (P<0.001). Alerting, orienting, and executive functions showed no differences between the two groups pre-operatively but were impaired in both groups on postoperative day 1 compared with pre-operative levels (P<0.001). On postoperative day 5, alerting (P=0.607) and orienting (P=0.851) functions recovered in the BIS group but remained impaired in the non-BIS group (P<0.001). Delirium was significantly lower in the BIS group compared with the non-BIS group (17.5% vs. 27.5%) (P<0.001).

Bispectral index (BIS) is a relatively new technique, based on the analysis of the electroencephalographic signal, which provides a good approximation to the level of consciousness, having already been validated in anesthesia.
The objective of the study was to evaluate the utility of BIS in the assessment of the intensity of hypercapnic encephalopathy in ECOPD patients.
A total of ten ECOPD patients were included, and the level of brain activity was assessed using BIS and different scales: Glasgow Coma Scale, Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS), and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. The evaluation was performed both in the acute phase and 3 months after discharge.
BIS was recorded for a total of about 600 minutes. During ECOPD, BIS values ranged from 58.8 (95% CI: 48.6-69) for RSS score of 4 to 92.2 (95% CI: 90.1-94.3) for RSS score of 2. A significant correlation was observed between values obtained with BIS and those from the three scales, although the best fit was for RSS, followed by Glasgow and Richmond (

Fifteen men aged >60 years (mean, 70 years) were selected. Propofol target-controlled infusion was performed under EEG bispectral index monitoring. The propofol target effect-site concentration, blood pressure, heart rate, and distributions and powers of the EEG spectrum were recorded in an awake state and under anesthesia. The EEG included seven bands: delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (4.0-7.0 Hz), alpha-1 (7.5-9.5 Hz), alpha-2 (10-12 Hz), beta-1 (13-23 Hz), beta-2 (24-34 Hz), and gamma (35-45 Hz).
From an awake state to anesthesia, the brain topographic map showed that the energies of delta, theta, alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta-1 were concentrated in the frontoparietal site, and the power increased significantly. The energy distribution of beta-2 was significantly decreased and the power significantly reduced. The energy distribution of gamma in the temporal lobe was also markedly decreased and the power significantly reduced.

Few hospitals in Japan have any PACU beds and instead have the anesthesiologists recover their patients in the operating room. We compared postoperative recovery times between a hospital with (University of Iowa) and without (Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital) a PACU.
This historical cohort study included 16 successive patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery with endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia, at each of the hospitals, and with the hours from OR entrance until the last surgical dressing applied ≥ two hours. Postoperative recovery times, defined as the end of surgery until leaving for the surgical ward, were compared between the hospitals.
The median [interquartile range] of recovery times was 112 [94-140] min at the University of Iowa and 22 [18-29] min at the Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital. Every studied patient at the University of Iowa had a longer recovery time than every such patient at Shin-yurigaoka General Hospital (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, P < 0.001). The ratio of the mean recovery times was 4.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.05 to 5.91; P < 0.001) and remained comparable after controlling for surgical duration (5.33; 95% CI, 3.66 to 7.76; P < 0.001). The anesthetics used in the Iowa hospital were a volatile agent, hydromorphone, ketorolac, and neostigmine compared with the Japanese hospital where bispectral index monitoring and target-controlled infusions of propofol, remifentanil, acetaminophen, and sugammadex were used.
This knowledge can be generally applied in situations at hospitals with regular PACU use when there are such large disruptions to PACU capacity that it is known before a case begins that the anesthesiologist likely will need to recover the patient (i.e., when there will not be an available PACU bed and/or nurse).

Seventy patients, 40 years of age or older, undergoing abdominal surgery expected to last three to five hours were randomly assigned to the DES group (n = 35) or the control group (n = 35). Patients in the DES group were maintained with desflurane anesthesia and received BIS monitoring and warming. Patients in the control group were given non-desflurane anesthesia for maintenance, and the usage of BIS monitoring and warming were not mandatory and determined by anesthesia care providers. Early postoperative recovery times were recorded.
The times to extubation (8.8 ± 8.5 vs 14.7 ± 13.7 min, P = 0.035), eye opening (8.4 ± 8.6 vs 14.4 ± 13.4 min, P = 0.028), responds on command (8.2 ± 8.5 vs 14.4 ± 13.0 min, P = 0.022), and the ACT (23.8 ± 11.4 vs 32.7 ± 15.4 min, P = 0.009) were significantly less in the DES group than that in the control group. The postanesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay, incidence of prolonged extubation, and surgeon and anesthesiologist satisfaction were similar in two groups. Also, the result of multivariable linear regressions showed that patients who were younger, female, lower BMI and non-DES anesthesia regimen resulted in prolonged extubation.
Desflurane anesthesia combined with BIS monitoring and warming is associated with early postoperative recovery in lengthy abdominal surgery.

Several studies have evaluated the potential association between bispectral index (BIS) and intraoperative awareness, however, the results obtained were controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to further assess the association between the BIS monitoring and the incidence of intraoperative awareness. A comprehensive search was conducted to identify all eligible studies from the online literature databases published prior to Feb. 2017. A total of five studies with 17 432 cases and 16 749 controls were included. An odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to examine the strength of the association. The results showed that in the overall analysis, the association between the BIS monitoring and the incidence of intraoperative awareness was not significant (OR=0.58, 95% CI= 0.22-1.58, P=0.29). A stratified analysis by comparing different anesthesia methods revealed that BIS monitoring group showed a lower incidence of intraoperative awareness in patients with intravenous anesthesia when compared with non-BIS monitoring group (OR=0.20, 95% CI=0.08-0.49, P=0.0004), whereas there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of intraoperative awareness between BIS and non-BIS monitoring groups in patients with inhalation anesthesia (OR=1.13, 95% CI=0.56-2.26, P=0.73).

Seventy-five patients, 1-18 years of age (stratified for age; 1-3, 3-6, 6-18 years, for subgroup analyses), were included in this prospective observational study. The aepEX and the bispectral index (BIS) were recorded simultaneously, the latter serving as a reference. The ability of the aepEX to detect different levels of consciousness, defined according to the University of Michigan Sedation Scale, investigated using prediction probability (Pk), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, served as the primary outcome parameter. As a secondary outcome parameter, the relationship between end-tidal desflurane and the aepEX and BIS values were calculated by fitting in a nonlinear regression model.
The Pk values for the aepEX and the BIS were, respectively, .68 (95% CI, 0.53-0.82) and .85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.96; P = .02). The aepEX and the BIS had an area under the ROC curve of, respectively, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.80-0.95) and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68-0.84; P = .04). The maximized sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 81% (95% CI, 61%-93%) and 86% (95% CI, 74%-94%) for the aepEX at a cutoff value of >52, and 69% (95% CI, 56%-81%) and 70% (95% CI, 57%-81%) for the BIS at a cutoff value of >65. The age-corrected end-tidal desflurane concentration associated with an index value of 50 (EC50) was 0.59 minimum alveolar concentration (interquartile range: 0.38-0.85) and 0.58 minimum alveolar concentration (interquartile range: 0.41-0.70) for, respectively, the aepEX and BIS (P = .69).

However, the distinct EEG dynamic characteristics at comparable sedation levels have not been well studied, resulting in potential interpretation errors in EEG monitoring during sedation. We aimed to analyze the EEG dynamics of dexmedetomidine and propofol at comparable sedation levels and to explore EEG changes with increased sedation levels for each agent. We measured the Bispectral Index (BIS) and 20-channel EEG under dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation from wakefulness, moderate sedation, and deep sedation to recovery in healthy volunteers (n = 10) in a randomized, 2-day, crossover study. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels. Despite similar changes in increased delta oscillations, multiple differences in the EEG spatiotemporal dynamics were observed between these two agents. During moderate sedation, both dexmedetomidine and propofol induced increased spindle power; however, dexmedetomidine decreased the global alpha/beta/gamma power, whereas propofol decreased the alpha power in the occipital area and increased the global spindle/beta/gamma power. During deep sedation, dexmedetomidine was associated with increased fronto-central spindle power and decreased global alpha/beta/gamma power, but propofol was associated with increased theta/alpha/spindle/beta power, which was maximized in the frontal area. The transition of topographic alpha/spindle/beta power distribution from moderate sedation to deep sedation completely differed between these two agents. Our study demonstrated that there was a distinct hierarchy of EEG changes with increased sedation depths by propofol and dexmedetomidine. Differences in EEG dynamics at the same sedation level might account for differences in the BIS value and reflect the different sedation mechanisms.

Patients who were manually administered propofol guided by BIS (n = 120) compared to those who were given propofol by weight (n = 115) did not differ concerning the incidence of hypotension (44% vs. 45%; p = 0.87). Study groups were also similar regarding the maximal drop in MAP compared to baseline (33% vs. 30%) and the proportion of hypotensive events related to all measurements (17% vs. 19%). Final propofol induction doses in BIS group and NON-BIS group were similar (1.93 mg/kg vs. 2 mg/kg). There was no linear correlation between BIS and the drop in MAP at all times (r < 0.2 for all) except for a weak one at 6 min (r = 0.221).
Results of our study suggest that a BIS-guided compared to a weight-adjusted manual administration of propofol for induction of general anesthesia in non-geriatric patients will not lower the incidence and degree of arterial hypotension.

We aimed to test the reliability and validity of the critical-care pain observation tool (CPOT) and the bispectral index (BIS) for pain detection in critically brain-injured patients.This prospective observational study was conducted in a neurosurgical intensive care unit in a University-Affiliated Hospital. Adult brain-injured patients undergoing mechanical ventilation were enrolled. Nociceptive (endotracheal suctioning) and non-nociceptive (gentle touching) procedures were performed in a random crossover fashion. Before and immediately after the procedure, CPOT was evaluated by 2 residents and 2 chief nurses, and BIS was documented. The ability to self-report pain was also assessed.

Quantitative reduction of propofol and quality of depth-of-anesthesia (primary objectives), intraoperative hemodynamics, incidence of postoperative adverse events (sedation, analgesia, nausea, and vomiting), and intraoperative awareness recall (secondary objectives) were analyzed.
There was a statistically significant lowering of propofol requirement (by 15%) in the dexmedetomidine group for induction of anesthesia (dexmedetomidine group: mean ± standard deviation 0.91 ± 0.26 mg/kg; nondexmedetomidine group: 1.07 ± 0.23 mg/kg, mean difference: 0.163, 95% CI, 0.04-0.28; P = .01) and maintenance of GA (dexmedetomidine group: 3.25 ± 0.97 mg/kg/h; nondexmedetomidine group: 4.57 ± 1.21 mg/kg/h, mean difference: 1.32, 95% CI, 0.78-1.85; P < .001). The median performance error of BIS control, a measure of bias, was significantly lower in dexmedetomidine group (1% [-5.8%, 8%]) versus nondexmedetomidine group (8% [2%, 12%]; P = .002). No difference was found for anesthesia depth consistency parameters, including percentage of time BIS within ±10 of target (dexmedetomidine group: 79.5 [72.5, 85.3]; nondexmedetomidine group: 81 [68, 88]; P = .534), median absolute performance error (dexmedetomidine group: 12% [10%, 14%]; nondexmedetomidine group: 12% [10%, 14%]; P = .777), wobble (dexmedetomidine group: 10% [8%, 10%]; nondexmedetomidine group: 8% [6%, 10%]; P = .080), and global score (dexmedetomidine group: 25.2 [23.1, 35.8]; nondexmedetomidine group: 24.7 [20, 38.1]; P = .387). Similarly, there was no difference between the groups for percentage of time intraoperative heart rate and mean arterial pressure remained within 20% of baseline. However, addition of dexmedetomidine to CLADS propofol increased the incidence of significant bradycardia (dexmedetomidine group: 14 [41.1%]; nondexmedetomidine group: 3 [9.1%]; P = .004), hypotension (dexmedetomidine group: 9 [26.5%]; nondexmedetomidine group: 2 [6.1%]; P = .045), and early postoperative sedation.
The addition of dexmedetomidine to propofol administered by CLADS was associated with a consistent depth of anesthesia along with a significant decrease in propofol requirements, albeit with an incidence of hemodynamic depression and early postoperative sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29787410/

Published comparative studies have used propofol or sevoflurane. However, studies using desflurane have not been reported yet. Different volatile anesthetics have different electroencephalography signatures. The performance of CSI may be different in desflurane anesthesia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare CSI and BIS during desflurane anesthesia.
Thirty-three patients were recruited. Desflurane and remifentanil were used to maintain general anesthesia. BIS and CSI were recorded simultaneously every minute. End-tidal concentration of desflurane was maintained at 4% from the beginning of surgery for 5 minutes. Pairwise data of CSI and BIS were obtained five times at one-minute intervals. This process was repeated in the order of 6%, 8%, and 10%.
BIS and CSI were negatively correlated with the end-tidal concentration of desflurane with a similar degree of correlation (correlation coefficient BIS: -0.847, CSI: -0.844). The relationship between CSI and BIS had a good linearity with a slope close to 1 (R2 = 0.905, slope = 1.01). For the relationship between CSI and BIS at each end-tidal concentration of desflurane, CSI and BIS showed good linearity in 4% and 10% (R2 = 0.559, 0.540). However, the linearity and slope were decreased in 6% and 8% (R2 = 0.163, 0.014).
CSI showed an equivalent degree of overall performance compared to BIS in desflurane anesthesia. Accounting for previous literature, CSI can be used as a good substitute for BIS regardless of the kind of anesthetics used.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29739183/

However, BIS readings can be subject to interference from many factors during surgery, and other parameters such as blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) can provide more stable indicators. However, anesthesiologist still consider BIS as a primary measure to determine if the patient is correctly anaesthetized while relaying on the other physiological parameters to monitor and ensure the patient's status is maintained. The automatic control of administering anesthesia using intelligent control systems has been the subject of recent research in order to alleviate the burden on the anesthetist to manually adjust drug dosage in response physiological changes for sustaining DOA. A system proposed for the automatic control of anesthesia based on type-2 Self Organizing Fuzzy Logic Controllers (T2-SOFLCs) has been shown to be effective in the control of DOA under simulated scenarios while contending with uncertainties due to signal noise and dynamic changes in pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) effects of the drug on the body. This study considers both BIS and BP as part of an adaptive automatic control scheme, which can adjust to the monitoring of either parameter in response to changes in the availability and reliability of BIS signals during surgery. The simulation of different control schemes using BIS data obtained during real surgical procedures to emulate noise and interference factors have been conducted. The use of either or both combined parameters for controlling the delivery Propofol to maintain safe target set points for DOA are evaluated. The results show that combing BIS and BP based on the proposed adaptive control scheme can ensure the target set points and the correct amount of drug in the body is maintained even with the intermittent loss of BIS signal that could otherwise disrupt an automated control system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29654373/

Material and Methods Ninety patients scheduled for elective caesarean section under general anaesthesia were included and randomly divided into three anaesthesia groups: 2 mg/kg propofol (control group); 2 mg/kg propofol and 1 µg/kg dexmedetomidine (dexmedetomidine group); and 2 mg/kg propofol and 1 µg/kg remifentanil (remifentanil group). All patients received routine monitoring, and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were recorded. The bispectral index and the isolated forearm technique were used to determine the depth of anaesthesia. Results Bispectral index values at skin and uterine incisions and at delivery were similar among the groups. The number of patients who responded positively to the isolated arm technique during the induction period was also similar. One-minute Apgar scores in the control group were significantly lower and 5-minute Apgar scores significantly higher than those in the other groups. Conclusion The effects of remifentanil and dexmedetomidine added to propofol on maternal awareness, neonatal Apgar scores, and bispectral index values were similar compared with propofol alone.

29524200,Prevalence of discordant elevations of state entropy and bispectral index in patients at amnestic sevoflurane concentrations: a historical cohort study.,Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,2018,"Epstein RH, Maga JM, Mahla ME, Schwenk ES, Bloom MJ","Processed electroencephalogram (EEG) monitors help assess the hypnotic state during general anesthesia or sedation. Maintaining the bispectral index (BIS) or state entropy (SE) between 40 and 60 has been recommended to mitigate anesthesia awareness. Nonetheless, SEs > 70 were frequently observed at end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations unlikely to allow awareness. We sought to determine the prevalence of elevated discordant measurements during BIS and SE monitoring.
Electronic data collected over 11 months at two academic hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. At the hospital using SE, all cases were included with patients ≥ 18 yr and sevoflurane administered for at least 30 min during surgery. A cohort of cases propensity matched by age and American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status were selected from the hospital using BIS. Elevated discordant EEG indices were defined as values > 70 occurring during stable end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations > 1.5%. The odds ratio (OR) based on the probability of a case having at least one elevated discordant SE or BIS lasting ≥ two minutes (primary endpoint) was calculated.
At each hospital, 3,690 cases were studied. The mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) incidence of cases with at least one interval of an elevated discordant EEG index lasting at least two minutes was 3.6% (2.8% to 4.4%) for SE compared with 0.24% (0.17% to 0.27%) for BIS (pooled OR, 17.0; 95% CI, 8.3 to 34.7; P < 0.001).
The prevalence of an elevated discordant EEG index is much greater with SE than with BIS. Elevated index values occurring at anesthetic concentrations well above the awareness threshold need to be assessed to determine if they indicate an inadequate depth of anesthesia requiring treatment or if they simply reflect the underlying monitoring algorithm.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29524200/

Optimizing sedation practice may reduce mortality, improve patient comfort and reduce cost. Current practice is to use scales or scores to assess depth of sedation based on clinical criteria such as consciousness, understanding and response to commands. However these are perceived as subjective assessment tools. Bispectral index (BIS) monitors, which are based on the processing of electroencephalographic signals, may overcome the restraints of the sedation scales and provide a more reliable and consistent guidance for the titration of sedation depth.The benefits of BIS monitoring of patients under general anaesthesia for surgical procedures have already been confirmed by another Cochrane review. By undertaking a well-conducted systematic review our aim was to find out if BIS monitoring improves outcomes in mechanically ventilated adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
To assess the effects of BIS monitoring compared with clinical sedation assessment on ICU length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, any cause mortality, risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), risk of adverse events (e.g. self-extubation, unplanned disconnection of indwelling catheters), hospital LOS, amount of sedative agents used, cost, longer-term functional outcomes and quality of life as reported by authors for mechanically ventilated adults in the ICU.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ProQuest, OpenGrey and SciSearch up to May 2017 and checked references citation searching and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We searched trial registries, which included clinicaltrials.gov and controlled-trials.com.
We included all randomized controlled trials comparing BIS versus clinical assessment (CA) for the management of sedation in mechanically ventilated critically ill adults.
We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures. We undertook analysis using Revman 5.3 software.
We identified 4245 possible studies from the initial search. Of those studies, four studies (256 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One more study is awaiting classification. Studies were, conducted in single-centre surgical and mixed medical-surgical ICUs. BIS monitor was used to assess the level of sedation in the intervention arm in all the studies. In the control arm, the sedation assessment tools for CA included the Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS), Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) or subjective CA utilizing traditional clinical signs (heart rate, blood pressure, conscious level and pupillary size). Only one study was classified as low risk of bias, the other three studies were classified as high risk.There was no evidence of a difference in one study (N = 50) that measured ICU LOS (Median (Interquartile Range IQR) 8 (4 to 14) in the CA group; 12 (6 to 18) in the BIS group; low-quality evidence).There was little or no effect on the duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -0.02 days (95% CI -0.13 to 0.09; 2 studies; N = 155; I

Nineteen patients scheduled for on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting under hypothermic conditions (n=10) or the equivalent off-pump surgery (n=9) were anesthetized with sufentanil and propofol target-controlled infusion (2 μg/mL) during surgery. The propofol concentration was then reduced to 1 μg/mL, and a pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics analysis using the maximum-effect-sigmoid model obtained by plotting the bispectral index values against the free propofol plasma levels was performed.
Significant increases (two- to five-fold) in the free propofol plasma levels were observed in the patients subjected to coronary artery bypass grafting under hypothermic conditions. The pharmacokinetics of propofol varied according to the free drug levels in the hypothermic on-pump group versus the off-pump group. After hypothermic coronary artery bypass was initiated, the distribution volume increased, and the distribution half-life was prolonged.

The aim of this study was to define the association of Bispectral Index (BIS) to the depth of sedation and airway obstruction events.
Forty-seven patients between 14-21 years old, who were candidates for 3rd molar teeth extraction, were enrolled in this study. Patients received a total of 4 mg midazolam, 100 microgram fentanyl followed by titrated incremental propofol in 10 mg. The Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS) was used to assess the depth of sedation. Each patient was attached to BIS monitor, while clinicians were not involved in the data collection process. Apnea, airway obstruction, O2 saturation, timing and interventions for controlling the situation were recorded. All data was synchronized with BIS data monitoring.
The results show that 97.5% of cases were ASA 1 and 2, with average age of 17.3 years (±1.4) and a median BMI of 26.1. By using linear regression, for every unit decrease of median RASS (less than zero), there was 1.78 decrease in mean BIS Score (P=0.045, 95% CI: 0.08-3.47). The mean BIS Index (over 1 minute) with airway obstruction was 64 (±10.2), which was significantly lower than the BIS during non-airway obstruction (77±11.6), (P<0.001). By using logistic regression analysis, for every on unit increase in BIS Index, there is 24% decrease in odds in having airway obstruction (P=0.0009, 95% CI: 0.65-8.94).

The aim is to adjust the drug dose to the real patient needs using heuristic knowledge provided by clinicians. A two-level computer decision system is proposed. The idea is to release the clinician from routine tasks so that he can focus on other variables of the patient.
The controller uses the Bispectral Index (BIS) to assess the hypnotic state of the patient. Fuzzy controller was included in a closed-loop system to reach the BIS target and reject disturbances. BIS was measured using a BIS VISTA monitor, a device capable of calculating the hypnosis level of the patient through EEG information. An infusion pump with propofol 1% is used to supply the drug to the patient. The inputs to the fuzzy inference system are BIS error and BIS rate. The output is infusion rate increment. The mapping of the input information and the appropriate output is given by a rule-base based on knowledge of clinicians.
To evaluate the performance of the fuzzy closed-loop system proposed, an observational study was carried out. Eighty one patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery were randomly distributed in 2 groups: one group using a fuzzy logic based closed-loop system (FCL) to automate the administration of propofol (42 cases); the second group using manual delivering of the drug (39 cases).

Yet, types of sedation assessment tools and sedation levels that are suitable for sedation treatment have not been investigated.
To investigate the influence of different sedation levels guided by the Bispectral Index (BIS) on the therapeutic effects for severe TBI.
According to inclusion, exclusion, and rejection criteria, 35 patients were prospectively included and divided into Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), BIS(I), and BIS(II) groups. The RASS group was controlled the level of sedation to within -2 or -3, and the BIS(I) and (II) groups within the range of 40-50 and 50-60, respectively. In addition to clinical data, RASS, BIS, and intracranial pressure (ICP) values were collected. RASS and ICP variability were introduced to investigate the different of sedative control effect with or without BIS monitor, and the control effect of ICP between different sedation levels. Statistical analysis was performed to estimate the effectiveness of different sedation levels guided by BIS in sedation treatment within 72 hours.
There were no significant differences in demographics among the 3 groups. RASS variability of the BIS(I) and (II) groups was significantly lower than that of the RASS group (P < 0.05), and in the BIS(I) group it was insignificantly lower than in the BIS(II) group.

Motor tracts were electrically stimulated and identified by a handheld brain-mapping probe, the NY Tract Finder (NYTF). Sixteen-gauge plastic tubes were mounted onto the NYTF and inserted in the estimated direction of the motor tract with reference to navigational information. Only the NYTF was removed, leaving the plastic tubes in their places, immediately after muscle motor evoked potentials were recorded at the minimum stimulation current. Motor tracts were electrically identified in all cases. Three-dimensional information on the position of motor tracts was given by plastic tubes that were neurophysiologically placed. Tips of tubes showed the resection limit during tumor removal. Safe tumor resection with an arbitrary safety margin can be performed by adjusting the length of the plastic tubes. The motor tract positioning method enabled the 3D recognition of the motor tract by surgeons and provided for safe resection of tumors. Tumor resections were performed safely before damaging motor tracts, without any postoperative neurological deterioration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29171804/

In addition, the dysregulation of GABA could be involved in the etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). In this study, we aimed to determine whether MDD has any effect on anesthetic requirement measured by Bispectral Index (BIS).
This study was designed as a prospective, observational study, registered ANZCTR (ACTRN 12616001295437), with institutional review board approval and written informed consent. Inpatients who were planned to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy as an elective surgery, were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into two groups, based on the results of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) which was assessed the 21-item self-administered scale measuring various symptoms of depression. If the BDI score was under 10, it was accepted as control group. Patients were consulted to the psychiatrist if the BDI score was 17 or more. Patients who were diagnosed as MDD by the psychiatrist, were classified as MDD group. Anesthesia was standardized, and delivered sevoflurane concentration was adjusted according to BIS value in both groups. Parameters of the study were heart rate, non-invasive arterial blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, BIS, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane at 5-minute intervals during the operation.
End-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was found to be lower in MDD group during the maintenance phase of anesthesia. Mean end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane were significantly lower in MDD group (1.28±0.15) than control group (1.52±0.22) (P<0.0001). BIS values were lower at 5- and 10-minute intervals in MDD group in comparison with control group. BIS values were similar at other time intervals in both groups during surgery.
MDD might result in decreased end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane. Further study is required to identify the relationship between MDD and anesthetics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28984090/

28946920,Role of bispectral index monitoring and burst suppression in prognostication following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review protocol.,Systematic reviews,2017,"Eveson L, Vizcaychipi M, Patil S","Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is associated with significant mortality or may have a poor neurological outcome. Various community-training programmes have improved practices like bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation using automated external defibrillator (AED). Post-resuscitation care has also changed significantly in the millennium. Interventions like targeted temperature management (TTM), avoidance of hyperoxia and emergency cardiac catheterisation have given patients a chance of a better neurological outcome. Despite these timely interventions, it is still very difficult to predict neurological outcome. The European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ERC-ESICM) published guidance in 2015 with a strong recommendation to delay prognostication for at least 72 h and with an emphasis to adapt a multimodal approach, which includes neurological examination, biomarkers, electroencephalogram (EEG) and radiological tests. These interventions not only have cost attached to them, but the unpredictability has a significant emotional impact on family members. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring device acts on the principle of EEG and converts the waveform into an absolute number and also measures the burst suppression. We hypothesize that patients who have a low BIS value and high burst suppression within 24 h of presentation will have a poor neurological outcome. The primary objective of this review is to look at BIS monitor as a tool, which could help bring forward the timing of prognostication.
Electronic databases will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials and prospective or retrospective cohort studies with no language restrictions. The search will be supplemented with grey literature searches of thesis, dissertations and hand searching of relevant journals. Two independent reviewers will screen, select and perform analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) method. The selected studies will be analysed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Meta-analysis will be performed if suitable.
This review will synthesize the evidence on the use of BIS monitors within 24 h of achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and may help in early prognostication.

However, clinical assessment of brain-death occurence is difficult in post-cardiac arrest patients, sedated, paralyzed, under mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH). Our objective was to assess the usefulness of Bispectral-Index (BIS) monitoring at bedside for an early detection of brain-death occurrence in refractory cardiac arrest patients treated by E-CPR.
This prospective study was performed in an intensive care unit of an university hospital. Forty-six patients suffering from refractory cardiac arrest treated by E-CPR were included. BIS was continuously recorded during ICU hospitalization. Clinical brain-death was confirmed when appropriate by EEG and/or cerebral CT angiography.
Twenty-nine patients evolved into brain-death and had average BIS values under MTH and after rewarming (temperature ≥35°C) of 4 (0-47) and 0 (0-82), respectively. Among these, 11 (38%) entered into a procedure of organs donation. Among the 17 non-brain-dead patients, the average BIS values at admission and after rewarming were 39 (0-65) and 59 (22-82), respectively. Two patients had on admission a BIS value equal to zero and evolved to a poor prognostic (CPC 4) and died after care limitations. BIS values were significantly different between patients who developed brain death and those who did not.

In this case, bispectral index (BIS) monitoring, a specific electroencephalogram-derived monitoring, can be used to find the optimal seizure induction time during anesthesia to elicit adequate seizures. A measurement of seizure adequacy in electroencephalogram is the postictal suppression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of seizure induction time on the degree of postictal suppression by comparing BIS versus no-BIS monitoring in MST and ECT.
Twenty patients with treatment-resistant depression were randomly assigned to either MST or ECT. Each patient underwent 3 treatments with the determination of seizure induction time by defined prestimulation BIS (BIS condition) and 3 treatments with determination of seizure induction time by controlled clinical trial protocol (no-BIS condition). Statistical analysis was calculated by repeated-measures analysis of variance.
The degree of postictal suppression was more pronounced in both MST and ECT, with BIS monitoring. In this connection, no differences between MST and ECT were found. Seizure induction time was significantly later in the BIS condition (181.3 ± 6 seconds) compared with the no-BIS condition (114.3 ± 12 seconds) (P < 0.001).
Adequacy of seizures, in the form of the degree of postictal suppression, was superior by determining the seizure induction time with BIS in both MST and ECT.

However, the effect of chronic opioid exposure on minimum alveolar concentration of inhalation agents remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the concentration of sevoflurane necessary to maintain a bispectral index (BIS) <50 (SEVOBIS50) in patients with chronic opioid use compared with those naïve to opioid use.
We included chronic opioid users who received a stable dose of oral morphine of at least 60 mg/d according to the morphine equivalent daily dose for at least 4 weeks and opioid-naïve patients. General anesthesia that included thiopental, vecuronium, and sevoflurane in oxygen was administered to all patients. Anesthesia was maintained using predetermined end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations. Fifteen minutes after achieving the determined end-tidal sevoflurane concentration through closed circuit anesthesia, BIS was measured for 1 minute in both groups. SEVOBIS50 was determined using Dixon's up-down method and probit analysis.
Nineteen and 18 patients from the chronic opioid and control groups, respectively, were included in the final analysis. SEVOBIS50values for the chronic opioid and control patients were 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.11) and 1.18 (95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.40), respectively (P = .0346).

Relevant clinical studies on human subjects involving choice of anaesthetic, ventilation and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring in the ECT setting were considered. The references of relevant studies were likewise considered.
Propofol yields the shortest seizures, etomidate and ketamine the longest. Etomidate and ketamine+propofol 1 : 1 seems to yield the seizures with best quality. Seizure quality is improved when induction of ECT is delayed until the effect of the anaesthetic has waned - possibly monitored with BIS values. Manual hyperventilation with 100% O2 may increase the pO2/pCO2-ratio, which may be correlated with better seizure quality.
Etomidate or a 1 : 1 ketamine and propofol combination may be the best method to achieve general anaesthesia in the ECT setting. There is a need for large randomised prospective studies comparing the effect of methohexital, thiopental, propofol, ketamine, propofol+ketamine 1 : 1 and etomidate in the ECT treatment of major depressed patients.

To investigate the degree of change in the BIS in patients receiving anesthesia with suxamethonium, we performed a prospective observational study of 63 participants who underwent closed reduction for nasal bone fracture. Anesthesia was induced by the total intravenous administration of anesthetics and 1.5 mg kg of suxamethonium was injected intravenously upon achieving BIS between 45 and 55. Intubation was performed after fasciculation. Electromyograms and BIS values were recorded from the induction of suxamethonium until 15 minutes after intubation.

The BIS value immediately after fasciculation (69.3 ± 10.6) was significantly higher than the cutoff BIS value of 60 (P < .001). Although fasciculation after the intravenous injection of suxamethonium resulted in the prompt increase of the BIS to values over 60, none of the participants was awake during surgery.

Traditionally, this procedure has been done under general anesthesia, but more recently local anesthesia and sedation have become popular. This research assessed the effectiveness of transfemoral TAVI under bispectral index (BIS)-guided sedation.
In this single-center retrospective control analysis, clinical data, including demographic characteristics, echocardiography, periprocedural data, and main complications, were collected and assessed in 113 patients undergoing TAVI through the femoral artery under general anesthesia (GA group, n=36) and under BIS-guided sedation (SED group, n=77).
The demographic characteristics and echocardiographic parameters between the two groups were similar (P>0.05). Two (2.6%) of patients were moved from BIS-guided sedation to general anesthesia for surgical reasons. Procedures were significantly shorter in the SED group than in the GA group ((127.10±44.43) min vs. (165.90±71.62) min, P=0.004).

28236863,Postoperative surveillance in neurosurgical patients - usefulness of neurological assessment scores and bispectral index.,Brazilian journal of anesthesiology (Elsevier),2017,"Herrero S, Carrero E, Valero R, Rios J, Fábregas N","We examined the additive effect of the Ramsay scale, Canadian Neurological Scale (CNS), Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC), and Bispectral Index (BIS) to see whether along with the assessment of pupils and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) it improved early detection of postoperative neurological complications.
We designed a prospective observational study of two elective neurosurgery groups of patients: craniotomies (CG) and non-craniotomies (NCG). We analyze the concordance and the odds ratio (OR) of altered neurological scales and BIS in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) for postoperative neurological complications. We compared the isolated assessment of pupils and GCS (pupils-GCS) with all the neurologic assessment scales and BIS (scales-BIS).
In the CG (n=70), 16 patients (22.9%) had neurological complications in PACU. The scales-BIS registered more alterations than the pupils-GCS (31.4% vs. 20%; p<0.001), were more sensitive (94% vs. 50%) and allowed a more precise estimate for neurological complications in PACU (p=0.002; OR=7.15, 95% CI=2.1-24.7 vs. p=0.002; OR=9.5, 95% CI=2.3-39.4). In the NCG (n=46), there were no neurological complications in PACU. The scales-BIS showed alterations in 18 cases (39.1%) versus 1 (2.2%) with the pupils-GCS (p<0.001). Altered CNS on PACU admission increased the risk of neurological complications in the ward (p=0.048; OR=7.28, 95% CI=1.021-52.006).
Applied together, the assessment of pupils, GCS, Ramsay scale, CNS, Nu-DESC and BIS improved early detection of postoperative neurological complications in PACU after elective craniotomies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28236863/

We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) and SE trend data, using the Entropy Module from 21 patients who underwent elective bronchoscopy with target-controlled infusion of propofol. EEG data were replayed to BIS and qCON with an EEG player. We calculated the Spearman correlation to evaluate similarities in index trend behavior and estimated the general index agreement of displaying the same anesthetic level, i.e., wakefulness, sedation and anesthesia. We used coughing episodes and the bronchoscope placement to investigate the index for possible arousal reactions.
We found a high to very high correlation of the indices' trend during the procedure. Furthermore, qCON was significantly lower than BIS and SE. All indices increased significantly after bronchoscope placement and coughing. The agreement of BIS/SE was 68% and around 50% for BIS/qCON and qCON/SE. The median duration of disagreement by >10 points was 39 s for BIS/SE and around 75 s for qCON with BIS and SE.
The results indicate a high probability of similar index performance between SE, BIS and qCON with the caveat of a different index scaling for qCON. These results can help the user of these monitoring devices to translate findings from one index to the other.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28177205/

Finally, 135 healthy children (3-12 years) scheduled for minor elective surgery were studied. Without premedication, anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium 5 mg/kg. Patients were randomized into 2 groups (control vs experimental) and then by virtue of rocuronium injection time, patients in the experimental group were allocated into 2 groups, as follows: in the control group (group C; n = 45), rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was administered at the loss of eyelash reflex; in the 1st experimental group, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was administered when BIS fell to less than 40 (group T; n = 45); however, if BIS did not fall below 40 after thiopental sodium administration, manual ventilation was provided with oxygen 6 L/minute using sevoflurane 8% and then rocuronium was administered when BIS fell below 40 (the 2nd experimental group, group S; n = 45). Rocuronium-induced WM was evaluated using a 4-point scale (no movement; movement/withdrawal involving the arm only; generalized response, with movement/withdrawal of more than 1 extremity, but no requirement for restraint of the body; and generalized response which required restraint of the body and caused coughing or breath-holding).
No significant differences were found among the groups for patient characteristics including age, sex, height, and location of venous cannula. However, body weight, height, and body mass index in group S were all smaller than those in group T. The incidence of WM caused by rocuronium was 100% in group C, 95.6% in group T, and 80% in group S, and was significantly lower in group S than in group C. The grade of WM was 3.7 ± 0.6 in group C, 3.2 ± 0.9 in group T, and 2.6 ± 1.0 in group S. It was significantly lower in group T than in group C and significantly lower in group S than in groups C and T.
The confirmation of a deep hypnotic state with BIS values lower than 40 using BIS monitoring can reduce the grade of rocuronium-induced WMs during anesthesia induction using thiopental sodium or sevoflurane in children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28079825/

We hypothesized that propofol might have a subtle influence on sleep after thyroidectomy compared to sevoflurane. A randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial was conducted at the First Hospital of China Medical University from October 2014 to October 2015. One hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing thyroidectomy were enrolled and received sevoflurane (sevoflurane group) or propofol (propofol group) as anesthesia maintenance. Major assessments were made during the operation (different types of anesthetic management) and on the first postoperative night (sleep status). The primary outcome was postoperative sleep status, measured by the BIS-Vista monitor on the first night after surgery between propofol and sevoflurane groups. A total of 105 patients (79 women, 26 men; mean age 49 years; range 18-65 years) were included in the final study sample. All patients in both groups showed one of the five sleep patterns classified by this trial. The BIS-area under the curve was decreased, the sleep efficiency index was significantly increased, and the durations of postoperative sleep and sleep stage N3 were increased by 110.5 and 36.5 min per patient, respectively, in the propofol compared to the sevoflurane group.

We hypothesized that the bispectral index (BIS), a quantified electroencephalogram instrument, would accurately detect deep levels of sedation.
We prospectively enrolled 90 critically ill mechanically ventilated patients who were receiving sedation. The BIS was monitored for 24 hours and compared with the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) evaluated every 4 hours. Deep sedation was defined as a RASS of -3 to -5. Threshold values of baseline BIS (the lowest value before RASS assessment) and stimulated BIS (the highest value after standardized assessment) for detecting deep sedation were determined in a training set (45 patients, 262 RASS assessments). Diagnostic accuracy was then analyzed in a validation set (45 patients, 264 RASS assessments).
Deep sedation was only prescribed in 6 (6.7%) patients, but 76 patients (84.4%) had at least 1 episode of deep sedation. Thresholds for detecting deep sedation of 50 for baseline and 80 for stimulated BIS were identified, with respective areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.771 (95% confidence interval, 0.714-0.828) and 0.805 (0.752-0.857). The sensitivity and specificity of baseline BIS were 94.0% and 66.5% and of stimulated BIS were 91.0% and 66.5%.

The objective of this systematic review with meta-analysis is to evaluate the clinical impact of monitoring with the bispectral index parameter.
The search for evidence in scientific information sources was conducted during December 2013 to January 2015, the following primary databases: Medline/PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane, CINAHL, Ovid, SCOPUS and TESES. The criteria for inclusion in the study were randomized controlled trials, comparing general anesthesia monitored, with bispectral index parameter with anesthesia guided solely by clinical parameters, and patients aged over 18 years. The criteria for exclusion were studies involving anesthesia or sedation for diagnostic procedures, and intraoperative wake-up test for surgery of the spine.
The use of monitoring with the bispectral index has shown benefits reducing time to extubation, orientation in time and place, and discharge from both the operating room and post anesthetic care unit. The risk of nausea and vomiting after surgery was reduced by 12% in patients monitored with bispectral index. Occurred a reduction of 3% in the risk of cognitive impairment postoperatively at 3 months postoperatively and 6% reduction in the risk of postoperative delirium in patients monitored with bispectral index. Furthermore, the risk of intraoperative memory has been reduced by 1%.
Clinically, anesthesia monitoring with the BIS can be justified because it allows advantages from reducing the recovery time after waking, mainly by reducing the administration of general anesthetics as well as the risk of adverse events.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28017174/

However, it can be difficult to record reliable MEPs from the muscles of the lower extremities during surgery in patients with preoperative weakness due to spinal cord compression. In this study, motor function of patients' lower extremities and their association with intraoperative MEP recording were compared.
Patients undergoing thoracic spinal cord tumor resection were studied. Patients' motor function was checked immediately before the surgical procedure. MEP responses were recorded from the tibialis anterior and foot muscles, and the hand muscles were used as control. Electrical current with train of eight pulses, 200 to 500 V was delivered through 2 corkscrews placed at C3' and C4' sites. Anesthesia was maintained by total intravenous anesthesia using a combination of propofol and remifentanil after induction with intravenous propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium. Rocuronium was not repeated. Bispectral Index was maintained between 40 to 50.
From 178 lower limbs of 89 patients, myogenic MEPs could be recorded from 100% (105/105) of the patients with 5 of 5 motor strength in lower extremity; 90% (36/40) from the patients with 4/5 motor strength; only 25% (5/20) with 3/5; and 12.5% (1/8) with 2/5 motor strength; none (0/5) were able to be recorded if the motor strength was 1/5.
The ability to record myogenic MEPs is closely associated with the patient's motor function. They are difficult to obtain if motor function is 3/5 motor strength in the lower extremity. They are almost impossible to record if motor function is worse than 3/5.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27851693/

In total, 180 pediatric patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II, who were scheduled for dental procedures of tooth extraction, filling, amputation, and root treatment.
Patients were categorized into 3 groups: music, isolation, and control. During the procedures, the patients in the music group listened to Vivaldi's The Four Seasons violin concertos by sound-isolating headphones, whereas the patients in the isolation group wore the headphones but did not listen to music. All patients were sedated by 0.1 mg/kg midazolam and 1 mg/kg propofol. During the procedure, an additional 0.5 mg/kg propofol was administered as required.
Bispectral index was used for quantifying the depth of sedation, and total dosage of the propofol was used for sedative requirements. The patients' heart rates, oxygen saturations, and Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale and bispectral index scores, which were monitored during the operation, were similar among the groups. In terms of the amount of propofol used, the groups were similar. Prolonged postoperative recovery cases were found to be significantly frequent in the control group, according to the recovery duration measurements (P = .004).
Listening to music or providing sound isolation during pediatric dental interventions did not alter the sedation level, amount of medication, and hemodynamic variables significantly.

Hence, anesthesia aims for an unconscious patient at the beginning and end of surgery but an awake and responsive patient in between. We investigated the plasma (Cplasma) and effect-site (Ceffect-site) propofol concentration as well as the related Bispectral Index (BIS) required for intraoperative return of consciousness and begin of neurological testing.
In 13 patients, arterial Cplasma were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography and Ceffect-site was estimated based on the Marsh and Schnider pharmacokinetic/dynamic (pk/pd) models. The BIS, Cplasma and Ceffect-site were compared during the intraoperative awakening period at designated time points such as return of consciousness and start of the Boston Naming Test (neurological test).
Return of consciousness occurred at a BIS of 77±7 (mean±SD) and a measured Cplasma of 1.2±0.4 μg/mL. The Marsh model predicted a significantly (P<0.001) higher Cplasma of 1.9±0.4 µg/mL as compared with the Schnider model (Cplasma=1.4±0.4 µg/mL) at return of consciousness. Neurological testing was possible as soon as the BIS had increased to 92±6 and measured Cplasma had decreased to 0.8±0.3 µg/mL. This translated into a time delay of 23±12 minutes between return of consciousness and begin of neurological testing. At begin of neurological testing, Cplasma according to Marsh (Cplasma=1.3±0.5 µg/mL) was significantly (P=0.002) higher as compared with the Schnider model (Cplasma=1.0±0.4 µg/mL).
To perform intraoperative neurological testing, patients are required to be fully awake with plasma propofol concentrations as low as 0.8 µg/mL.

Monitoring by means of the bispectral index (BIS) has shown its utility in reducing the use of drugs and their adverse events in general anesthesia, but evidence in prolonged sedation is insufficient.
Our objective was to evaluate BIS in patients undergoing endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS).
A randomized cohort study of 90 patients with mediastinal lymph node involvement and/or lung or mediastinal lesions for whom EBUS was indicated, comparing the modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale clinical evaluation (n = 45) versus the BIS evaluation (n = 45) of sedation with propofol-remifentanil, was conducted in order to evaluate the clinical parameters, doses used, adverse events, and tolerance of the procedure.
We found a shorter waking time and a significantly lower dose of total propofol in the BIS group. Significantly fewer overall adverse events were recorded in the BIS group and included desaturation, hypotension, and bradypnea. Tolerance was better in the BIS group. No significant differences were found in terms of cough, memory of the procedure, or the level of difficulty of EBUS on the part of the pulmonologists.
BIS monitoring of sedation in EBUS makes it possible to reduce the dosage of propofol, thereby shortening the waking time and reducing adverse events.

We determined the effects of different dexmedetomidine doses on the median effective concentration (EC50) of propofol and bispectral index (BIS) values during anesthesia induction.
This randomized, prospective, case-control clinical trial involved 120 patients (56 women; physical status, American Society of Anesthesiologists grades I or II) scheduled to undergo surgery requiring general anesthesia from July 15th, 2014 to June 15th, 2015. The patients were divided into groups of 30 and received dexmedetomidine (0.5 µg/kg, group L; 0.75 µg/kg, group M; 1 µg/kg, group H) with propofol for loss of consciousness or propofol only (control group, group C). EC50, BIS, hemodynamics, and side effects were assessed.
The EC50 of propofol was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine groups than in group C, and decreased with increasing dexmedetomidine dose (p < 0.05). BIS values significantly decreased after 2 min of dexmedetomidine infusion in all dexmedetomidine groups; the values at 8 and 10 min were lower in the dexmedetomidine groups than in group C. The heart rate was lower in the dexmedetomidine groups than in group C. The incidence of bradycardia at loss of consciousness increased with increasing dexmedetomidine dose.
Dexmedetomidine significantly and dose-dependently reduced the EC50 of propofol and BIS values during anesthesia induction. A loading dexmedetomidine dose of 0.5 µg/kg significantly reduced the EC50 of propofol and BIS value, and was associated with a lower incidence of bradycardia than higher doses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27460746/

The clinical benefits of intraoperative monitoring with cerebral oximetry [near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and brain tissue oxygenation monitoring (brptiO2)] and depth of anaesthesia with bispectral index (BIS) have recently been studied in surgical (carotid endarterectomy, cerebral arteriovenous malformations resection and brain tumour resections) and neuroradiological vascular procedures. BrptiO2/PaO2 ratio is much more reliable than absolute brptiO2 readings in detecting hypoxia in arteriovenous malformation resections. NIRS can help clinicians monitor those patients receiving endovascular treatment for acute ischaemic stroke and during carotid endarterectomy, but the value of applying cerebral oximetry in patients with cerebral vasospasm needs to be further evaluated. Awake craniotomy demonstrated that because of considerable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interindividual variation, BIS titration is recommended. Thus, the presence of a frontal brain tumour did not affect ipsilateral BIS values.
Recent studies provide interesting evidence of intraoperative monitoring of NIRS, brptiO2 and BIS. The brptiO2/PaO2 ratio is much more reliable than an absolute brptiO2 reading; NIRS helps clinicians to monitor patients who are undergoing endovascular treatment, and BIS guides the titration of anaesthesia during awake craniotomy; its values are not affected by the presence of a frontal brain tumour.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27367415/
27325591,Correlation Between Bispectral Index and Electrocorticographic Features During Epilepsy Surgery.,Clinical EEG and neuroscience,2017,"Ramírez MIG, Rodríguez-Arias LR, Santiago AO, Pizano AL, Zamora RL, Gregorio RV, Trenado C, Sánchez HMG, San-Juan D","Surgical resection guided by intraoperative electrocorticography (iECoG) has been in clinical use for many decades. The use of the bispectral index (BIS) for monitoring depth of anesthesia during different types of surgery, including epilepsy surgery, is increasing nowadays. The BIS is an EEG-derived variable indicating cortical electrical activity. However, the correlation between the BIS score and the iECoG score, with the purpose of optimizing the quality and time of the iECoG recordings in epilepsy surgery is unknown. The goal of this study was to evaluate the correlation between BIS values and iECoG parameters during the epilepsy surgery under anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl. This is a prospective study that included patients with epilepsy who underwent epilepsy surgery guided by BIS and iECoG (September 2008 to October 2013). Clinical, physiological, and sociodemographic characteristics are shown. We correlated the iECoG parameters (presence of burst suppressions [BS], suppression time [seconds], background frequency [Hz], and type of iECoG score by Mathern et al) with BIS values. We included 28 patients, 15/28 (53.5%) female, general mean age of 30.5 years (range 13-56 years). Patients underwent epilepsy surgery: 22/28 (79%) temporal and 6/28 (21%) extratemporal. We found a nonlinear polynomial cubic relationship between the mentioned variables noting that a BIS range of 40 to 60 gave the following results: iECoG BS periods <5 seconds, background frequency 10 to 17 Hz, and iECoG score 2 characterized by lack of >20-Hz background frequencies. No BS were observed with a BIS > 60. In conclusion BIS values and iECoG parameters during the epilepsy surgery under anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl have a nonlinear correlation. BS patterns were not found with a BIS > 60. These findings show that BIS is a nonlinear multidimensional measure, which possesses high variability with the iECoG parameters. BS patterns are not found with BIS > 60.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27325591/

The objective of this systematic review was to determine whether using a depth of anaesthesia monitoring device improves the safety and efficacy of sedation.
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Electronic databases (CENTRAL; Medline; CINAHL) were searched up to May 2015.
Randomised controlled trials that compared use of a depth of anaesthesia monitoring device to a control group who received standard monitoring during procedural sedation and analgesia were included. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment (Cochrane risk of bias tool) were performed by two reviewers. Safety outcomes were hypoxaemia, hypotension and adverse events. Efficacy outcomes were amount of sedation used, duration of sedation recovery and rate of incomplete procedures.
A total of 16 trials (2138 participants) were included. Evidence ratings were downgraded to either low or moderate quality due to study limitations and imprecision. Meta-analysis of 8 trials (766 participants) found no difference in hypoxaemia (RR 0.87; 95% CI=0.67-1.12). No statistically significant difference in hypotension was observed in meta-analysis of 8 trials (RR 0.96; 95% CI=0.54-1.7; 942 participants). Mean dose of propofol was 51mg lower for participants randomised to depth of anaesthesia monitoring (95% CI=-88.7 to -13.3mg) in meta-analysis of results from four trials conducted with 434 participants who underwent interventional endoscopy procedures with propofol infusions to maintain sedation. The difference in recovery time between depth of anaesthesia and standard monitoring groups was not clinically significant (standardised mean difference -0.41; 95% CI=-0.8 to -0.02; I
Depth of anaesthesia monitoring did impact sedation titration during interventional procedures with propofol infusions. For this reason, it seems reasonable for anaesthetists to utilise a depth of anaesthesia monitoring device for select populations of patients if it is decided that limiting the amount of sedation would be beneficial for the individual patient. However, there is no need to invest in purchasing extra equipment or training staff who are not familiar with this technology (e.g. nurses who do not routinely use a depth of anaesthesia monitoring device during general anaesthesia) because there is no high quality evidence suggestive of clear clinical benefits for patient safety or sedation efficacy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27236824/

Sedation level can be measured with EEG monitoring with the bispectral index (BIS) monitor.
To determine the feasibility and validity of BIS monitoring in terminally ill patients.
In this prospective study, BIS registrations were performed in unconscious end-of-life patients admitted to a palliative care center. Validated scores were used to measure level of sedation (Ramsay score), pain (Numeric Rating Scale or Rotterdam Elderly Pain Observations Scale), delirium (Delirium Observation Screening score), and overall comfort (Numeric Rating Scale). Validity and sensitivity to change of BIS values were considered, and the effects of medication and the time till death on BIS values were evaluated in a linear mixed model analysis.
Fifty-eight patients were included for analysis. BIS monitoring was acceptable to patients, relatives, and medical staff. BIS values were moderately correlated with Ramsay scores (0.46) but were highly variable for deeply sedated patients. BIS values changed significantly before and after a midazolam dose (P < 0.001). Midazolam treatment resulted on average in a statistically significant reduction of the BIS values (-4.5, 95% CI -7.0 to -2.0), whereas morphine and haloperidol did not.
This is one of the first validation studies in which BIS monitoring in end-of-life patients is described. BIS monitoring is feasible in unconscious terminally ill patients.

We hypothesized that, compared with dexmedetomidine, midazolam might have a subtle influence on sleep quality after surgery following elective transurethral prostatic resection (TURP) in elderly male patients.
A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted at the First Hospital of China Medical University from July 2014 to January 2015. One hundred eleven patients undergoing TURP were enrolled and received intravenous saline infusion (control group), dexmedetomidine (dexmedetomidine group), or midazolam (midazolam group) for sedation during the spinal anesthesia procedure. The intraoperative sedative state and postoperative sleep quality were evaluated using a Bispectral Index (BIS)-Vista monitor. The primary outcome was postoperative sleep quality, as measured by the BIS-Vista monitor on the first night after surgery.
The intraoperative BIS area under the curve value was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group (54.1%) compared with those in the other 2 groups (control group, 94.1%; midazolam group, 77.2%).The postoperative BIS area under the curve value was highest in the dexmedetomidine group at 88.7%. The BIS sleep efficiency index showed a significant 33.1% increase in the midazolam group compared with the dexmedetomidine group.

We retrospectively collected intraoperative data on 55,210 surgical cases at a tertiary care hospital. Variables collected included: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, anesthesia provider type and level of training, use of inhalational anesthetics versus total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), utilization of nitrous oxide, utilization of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade, emergency status of surgery, airway type, case duration, and surgical subspecialty. A univariate logistic regression model was fitted. Subsequently, a multivariate logistic regression model was applied. Covariates utilized for the model included age, anesthesia provider level, and length of case. Factors associated with BIS use included increased age, greater ASA physical status, extremes of BMI, use of TIVA, use of a long-acting paralytic agent, use of an endotracheal tube (ETT), emergency surgery, increasing length of case, and certain surgical services.

The prospective randomised single blind study was done in children between 2 and 9 years of ASA I and II and they were randomly allocated to Group P (proseal laryngeal mask airway insertion) and Group TI (tracheal intubation). No sedative premedication was given. Induction was done with 8% sevoflurane and then predetermined concentration was maintained for 10 min. Airway was secured either by proseal laryngeal mask airway or endotracheal tube without using muscle relaxant. End tidal sevoflurane concentration, MAC, BIS, and other vital parameters were monitored every minute till insertion of an airway device. Insertion conditions were observed.

The pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and drug interactions of the combination are well understood, but the use of a combined PK and PD model to control target-controlled infusion pumps has not been investigated. In this study, we prospectively tested the accuracy of a PD target-controlled infusion algorithm for propofol and remifentanil using a response surface model of their combined effects on Bispectral Index (BIS).
Effect-site, target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil were given using an algorithm based on standard PK models linked to a PD response surface model of their combined effects on BIS. The combination of a targeted BIS value and adjustable ratio of propofol to remifentanil was used to adjust infusion rates. The standard model performance measures of median performance error (bias) and median absolute performance error (inaccuracy), expressed as percentages, were used to assess accuracy of the infusions in a convenience sample of 50 adult patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. The influence of age and weight on the performance of the model was also assessed.
Patients had a mean (range) age of 48 (19-73) years, weight of 80 (45-169) kg, and body mass index of 28 (19-45) kg/m. The overall model had a bias of 8% (SD 24%) and inaccuracy of 25% (SD 13%). Performance was least accurate during the early induction phase of anesthesia. There was no significant bias in BIS predictions with increasing age (P = 0.44) or weight (P = 0.56).

Anesthesia techniques that minimize anesthetic requirements and their effects may be beneficial. Esmolol, a short acting hyperselective β-adrenergic blocker is effective in blunting adrenergic response to several perioperative stimuli and so it might interfere in the effect of the anesthetic drugs on the brain. This study was designed to investigate the effect of esmolol on the consumption of propofol and sevoflurane in patients undergoing craniotomy.
Forty-two patients that underwent craniotomy for aneurysm clipping or tumour dissection were randomly divided in two groups (four subgroups). Anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl and a single dose of cis-atracurium, followed by continuous infusion of remifentanil and either propofol or sevoflurane. Patients in the esmolol group received 500 mcg/kg of esmolol bolus 10 min before induction of anesthesia, followed by additional 200 mcg/kg/min of esmolol. Monitoring of the depth of anesthesia was also performed using the Bispectral Index-BIS and cardiac output. The inspired concentration of sevoflurane and the infusion rate of propofol were adjusted in order to maintain a BIS value between 40-50. Intraoperative emergence was detected by the elevation of BIS value, HR or MAP.
The initial and the intraoperative doses of propofol and sevoflurane were 18-50 mcg/kg/min and 0.2-0.5 MAC respectively in the esmolol group, whereas in the control group they where 100-150 mcg/kg/ and 0.9-2.0 MAC respectively (p = 0.000 for both groups). All procedures were anesthesiologically uneventful with no episodes of intraoperative emerge.
Esmolol is effective not only in attenuating intraoperative hemodynamic changes related to sympathetic overdrive but also in minimizing significant propofol and sevoflurane requirements without compromising the hemodynamic status.

Polysomnography (PSG) is considered the gold standard test to monitor sleep objectively, but some practical and technical constraints exist due to environmental and patient considerations. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is commonly used in clinical practice for guiding anesthetic administration and provides an index based on relationships between EEG components. Due to similarities in EEG synchronization between anesthesia and sleep, several studies have assessed BIS as a sleep monitor with contradictory results. The aim of this study was to evaluate objectively both the feasibility and reliability of BIS for sleep monitoring through a robust methodology, which included full PSG recordings at a baseline situation and after 40 h of sleep deprivation. Results confirmed that the BIS index was highly correlated with the hypnogram (0.89 ± 0.02), showing a progressive decrease as sleep deepened, and an increase during REM sleep (awake: 91.77 ± 8.42; stage N1: 83.95 ± 11.05; stage N2: 71.71 ± 11.99; stage N3: 42.41 ± 9.14; REM: 80.11 ± 8.73). Mean and median BIS values were lower in the post-deprivation night than in the baseline night, showing statistical differences for the slow wave sleep (baseline: 42.41 ± 9.14 vs. post-deprivation: 39.49 ± 10.27; p = 0.02). BIS scores were able to discriminate properly between deep (N3) and light (N1, N2) sleep. BIS values during REM overlapped those of other sleep stages, although EMG activity provided by the BIS monitor could help to identify REM sleep if needed. In conclusion, BIS monitors could provide a useful measure of sleep depth in especially particular situations such as intensive care units, and they could be used as an alternative for sleep monitoring in order to reduce PSG-derived costs and to increase capacity in ambulatory care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26578097/

Using PubMed as the principal source, this review included published studies in all languages comparing mortality in patients with low- and high-processed electro-encephalo-graphic index values.
All published studies used the bispectral index (BIS) monitor to measure anesthetic depth. The majority of the published observational studies were post hoc analyses of studies undertaken for other purposes. Most of these studies report a statistically significant association between deep general anesthesia (i.e., BIS values < 45) and death. Some studies also suggest an association between deep general anesthesia and myocardial infarction or postoperative cognitive decline. The combination of low BIS values and low delivered anesthetic concentrations (thus defining increased anesthetic sensitivity) may identify patients at particularly high risk. One of the three available randomized controlled trials reports worse outcomes in the BIS = 50 group compared with the BIS > 80 group, and two report no difference in mortality between the BIS = 35 and BIS = 50-55 groups.
The available evidence on anesthetic depth and long-term survival is inconclusive. Randomized controlled trials with carefully controlled arterial blood pressure are required.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26378002/

We randomly assigned 80 patients undergoing elective escharectomy (<1 week) to BIS (A) and control (B) groups. All patients received remifentanil and propofol as intravenous TCI anesthesia. Clinical data were recorded at different time points. The time from drug withdrawal to eye opening upon the patient hearing his/her name called and upon reaching an Aldrete score of 9 points was also recorded. During anesthesia maintenance, the target concentrations of remifentanil and propofol in group A were significantly lower than that in group B (2.12 ± 0.35 vs 2.50 ± 0.21 ng/mL and 2.54 ± 0.22 vs 2.86 ± 0.31 μg/mL, respectively; P < 0.01).

Sixty patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery were prospectively randomized to receive GA with desflurane alone (group C) or in combination with a preoperative ISB by either bupivacaine 0.25 % (group B) 40 ml or levobupivacaine 0.25 % (group L) 40 ml. BIS scores or respiratory and hemodynamic parameters during the operation, recovery characteristics, consumed doses of desflurane and pain intensities were evaluated.
The eye opening time was 4.0 ± 2.5 minutes for group B, 4.6 ± 2.4 minutes for group L, and 6.2 ± 2.1 minutes for group C (p < 0.05). Group B and group L saved 36 % and 25 % desflurane per unit time respectively when compared with group C (p < 0.001and p < 0.05) while the mean pain scores and analgesic requirements the first day after surgery were higher in group C (p < 0.05).
Because of lower desflurane consumption, a superior recovery profile, and a high degree of patient acceptance, general anaesthesia in combination with interscalene block may be preferred in arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

26174308,Response of bispectral index to neuromuscular block in awake volunteers.,British journal of anaesthesia,2015,"Schuller PJ, Newell S, Strickland PA, Barry JJ","The bispectral index (BIS) monitor is a quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) device that is widely used to assess the hypnotic component of anaesthesia, especially when neuromuscular blocking drugs are used. It has been shown that the BIS is sensitive to changes in electromyogram (EMG) activity in anaesthetized patients. A single study using an earlier version of the BIS showed that decreased EMG activity caused the BIS to decrease even in awake subjects, to levels that suggested deep sedation and anaesthesia.
We administered suxamethonium and rocuronium to 10 volunteers who were fully awake, to determine whether the BIS decreased in response to neuromuscular block alone. An isolated forearm technique was used for communication during the experiment. Two versions of the BIS monitor were used, both of which are in current use. Sugammadex was used to antagonise the neuromuscular block attributable to rocuronium.
The BIS decreased after the onset of neuromuscular block in both monitors, to values as low as 44 and 47, and did not return to pre-test levels until after the return of movement. The BIS showed a two-stage decrease, with an immediate reduction to values around 80, and then several minutes later, a sharp decrease to lower values. In some subjects, there were periods where the BIS was <60 for several minutes. The response was similar for both suxamethonium and rocuronium. Neither monitor was consistently superior in reporting the true state of awareness.
These results suggest that the BIS monitor requires muscle activity, in addition to an awake EEG, in order to generate values indicating that the subject is awake. Consequently, BIS may be an unreliable indicator of awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking drugs.

Previously, no attempt had been made to discover which EEG characteristics cause discrepancies between BIS and Entropy. We compared BIS and Entropy values, and analysed the changes in the raw EEG signal during surgical anaesthesia with sevoflurane.
In this prospective, open-label study, 65 patients receiving general anaesthesia with sevoflurane were enrolled. BIS, Entropy and multichannel digital EEG were recorded. Concurrent BIS and State Entropy (SE) values were selected. Whenever BIS and SE values showed ≥10-unit disagreement for ≥60 s, the raw EEG signal was analysed both in time and frequency domain.
A ≥10-unit disagreement ≥60 s was detected 428 times in 51 patients. These 428 episodes accounted for 5158 (11%) out of 45 918 analysed index pairs. During EEG burst suppression, SE was higher than BIS in 35 out of 49 episodes. During delta-theta dominance, BIS was higher than SE in 141 out of 157 episodes. During alpha or beta activity, SE was higher than BIS in all 49 episodes. During electrocautery, both BIS and SE changed, sometimes in the opposite direction, but returned to baseline values after electrocautery. Electromyography caused index disagreement four times (BIS > SE).
Certain specific EEG patterns, and artifacts, are associated with discrepancies between BIS and SE. Time and frequency domain analyses of the original EEG improve the interpretation of studies involving BIS, Entropy and other EEG-based indices.

We describe a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of arterial and venous concentrations of AZD3043 and the pharmacodynamic effects on bispectral index (BIS) in healthy volunteers.
Arterial and venous plasma concentrations of AZD3043 and BIS were measured in 2 clinical studies in 125 healthy volunteers, where AZD3043 was given as a 1-minute bolus (1-6 mg/kg), a 30-minute infusion (1-81 mg/kg/h), or 0.8 + 10, 1 + 15, 3 + 30, and 4 + 40 (mg/kg bolus + mg/kg/h infusion for 30 minutes). Population PK/pharmacodynamic analysis was performed with NONMEM.
A recirculatory model, comprising a series of 5 compartments for the transit of drug between venous and arterial plasma, 2 peripheral distribution compartments, and 1 compartment for the nondistributive transit of drug from arterial to venous plasma, described the PK of AZD3043. Systemic clearance was high (2.2 L/min; 95% confidence interval, 2.12-2.25), and apparent volumes of distribution were low, leading to a short elimination half-life. The apparent volumes of distribution of the arterial and peripheral compartments increased with increasing administered dose, giving a total apparent volume of distribution of 15 L after the lowest dose and 37 L after the greatest dose. A sigmoid maximum effect (Emax) model with an EC50 of 15.6 µg/mL and a γ of 1.7 described the relationship between AZD3043 effect-site concentrations and BIS. The between-subject variability in EC50 was 37%. An effect compartment model, with a half-life of the equilibration rate constant ke0 of 1.1 min, described the delay in effect in relation to the arterial plasma concentrations.
AZD3043 had a high clearance and a low apparent volume of distribution, leading to a short half-life. However, the apparent volume of distribution was dose dependent (P < 0.001), leading to an increased half-life with increasing dose. The distribution to the effect site was fast and together with the short plasma half-life led to a fast onset and offset of effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26097984/

However, seizure quality can be affected by the depth of anesthesia and choice of anesthetic agent. The purpose of this study was to describe a general anesthetic technique for ECT by using laryngeal mask, bispectral index (BIS), and muscle relaxant monitoring.
Twenty-one patients, between ages 18 and 70 years (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III), who underwent a total of 89 sessions of ECT were examined in a retrospective study. Anesthesia was induced by use of propofol (1.0 mg/kg) followed by cisatracurium (0.2 mg/kg). The BIS, train-of-four, and end-tidal carbon dioxide were all monitored continuously. A laryngeal mask airway was used to maintain and protect the airway during the procedure. Electroconvulsive therapy stimuli were applied bilaterally when the train-of-four was assessed as being zero and BIS scores were 70. All patients then received 5 μg sufentanil and 2 mg midazolam, while titrated to maintain the BIS value at 40 to 50, before the muscle relaxation exhibited complete recovery.
The mean duration of treatment process takes approximately 82.5 minutes. Mean (SD) seizure length was 58.8 (28.3) seconds, with 4.5% incidence of restimulation per treatment. Incidence of awareness was 0%. No patients exhibited delirium, nausea, vomiting, or myalgia in the postseizure phase.

In this prospective observational study, 21 anaesthetic registrars self-regulated alcohol consumption over a 3-h period. Expired alcohol concentration (breathalyser) and BIS measurements were performed hourly for 4 h. A venous blood alcohol sample was taken at the conclusion of the study period.
The main outcome measures were the correlation between blood alcohol and brain function as measured by BIS and the change in BIS from baseline (∆BIS) at 4 h. The median number of standard drinks consumed was 9.1 (IQR 7.7-12.3), range 5.4-17.

Small clinical trials of anesthetic depth have demonstrated increased delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients who were relatively deeply anesthetized, but have been inadequately powered to study mortality. A large-scale randomized study is required to determine whether causality exists.
The primary hypothesis of our study is that ""light"" anesthesia, defined as a BIS target of 50, will reduce all-cause mortality within 1 year of surgery in comparison with ""deep"" anesthesia, defined as a BIS target of 35, in patients aged ≥60 years presenting for major surgery under general anesthesia. The trial is an international multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind (patients and investigators) prospective, intention-to-treat, safety and efficacy study. The relative reduction in mortality in the light anesthesia group is expected to be 20%, giving an absolute risk reduction from 10% to 8%. Power analysis using a = 0.049 and b = 0.2 indicates that 3250 patients are required in each group.
The study is underway, and 1325 patients have been recruited in 40 centers in 5 countries. It is anticipated that the study will be completed in 3 years.

Although observation of pain behaviors (e.g., frowning) is recommended for pain assessment in nonverbal populations, they are attenuated and sometimes even suppressed in patients with TBI receiving high doses of sedatives. This study explored the potential utility of the bilateral bispectral index system (BIS) for pain detection in critically ill adults with TBI and altered level of consciousness.
Using a repeated measure within-subject design, participants (N = 25) were observed for 1 minute before (baseline), during, and 15 minutes after two procedures: (a) noninvasive blood pressure (nonnociceptive) and (b) turning (nociceptive). At each assessment, BIS indexes (0-100) of the right (R) and left (L) hemispheres and pain behaviors were documented.
Compared with baseline, significant median increases (p ≤ .05) in BIS-R (+4.93%) and BIS-L (+8.43%) and in the frequency of pain behaviors (+3.00) were observed during turning but not noninvasive blood pressure. Interestingly, increases in BIS-R were more pronounced in participants with left-sided TBI (+17.23%, p = .021) than those with right-sided TBI (+3.01%). BIS-R fluctuations in participants with left-sided TBI were also positively correlated (r(s) = .986, p ≤ .001) with the frequency of pain behaviors observed during turning.
Overall, only increases in BIS-R were correlated with participants' pain behaviors and in those with left-sided TBI exclusively. Although further research is needed, our findings support the potential use of the bilateral BIS for pain detection in nonverbal patients with TBI who cannot behaviorally respond to pain, but only when they have a left-sided injury.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25943998/

The present trial was aimed at evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of Bispectral Index (BIS)-guided closed-loop anesthesia delivery system (CLADS) in comparison with manual control across multiple centers in India.
Adult patients scheduled for major surgical procedures of an expected duration of 1 to 3 hours were randomized across 6 sites into 2 groups: a CLADS group and a manual group. In the manual control group, propofol infusion was titrated manually by the attending anesthesiologist to a BIS of 50 during induction and maintenance. Analgesia was maintained with fentanyl infusion and nitrous oxide in both groups. In the CLADS group, both induction and maintenance of anesthesia were performed automatically using CLADS. The primary outcome measure was the performance of the system as assessed by the percentage of total anesthesia time BIS remained ±10 of target BIS. The secondary outcome measures were a percentage of anesthesia-time heart rate and mean arterial pressure within 25% of the baseline, median absolute performance error, wobble, and global score. Wobble indicates intraindividual variability in the control of BIS, and global score reflects the overall performance; lower values indicate superior performance for both parameters. The performance parameters of the system also were compared among the participating sites.
Two hundred forty-two patients were randomized. BIS was maintained within ±10 of target for significantly longer time in the CLADS group (81.4% ± 8.9 % of anesthesia duration) than in the manual group (55.34% ± 25%, P < 0.0001). The indices that assess performance were significantly better in the CLADS group than the manual group as follows: median absolute performance error was 10 (10, 12) (median [interquartile range]) in the CLADS group versus 18 (14, 24) in the manual group, P < 0.0001; wobble was 9 (8, 10) in CLADS group versus 10 (8, 14) in the manual group, P = 0.0009; and Global score, which reflects overall performance, was 24 (19, 30) in the CLADS group versus 51 (31, 99) in the manual group, P < 0.0001. The percentage of time heart rate was within 25% of the baseline was significantly greater in the CLADS group (heart rate of 95 [87, 99], median [interquartile range], in the CLADS group versus 90 [75, 98] in the manual group P = 0.0031). On comparison of data between the centers, the performance parameters did not differ significantly among the centers in the CLADS group (P = 0.94), but the parameters differed significantly among the centers in the manual group (P < 0.001).

A total of 34 consecutive patients who underwent DBE by the oral approach were enrolled. Patients were primarily sedated with a continuous infusion of propofol and adjusted in accordance with the BIS levels. The bolus infusion of pentazocine was performed when the propofol infusion was insufficient. The primary outcome measure of this study was to ensure the safety and efficacy of this sedation technique. The secondary purpose was to identify the characteristics of the patient who required the bolus infusion of pentazocine.
Five patients (14.7%) required a reduction in the dose of propofol. However, no patient experienced any serious adverse events. All patients (100%) and 80.6% (25/31) of endoscopists answered that the sedation protocol was 'excellent' or 'enough' for peroral DBE.

Prospective, randomised, open-label, clinical trial was performed on an intention to treat basis. It included 280 patients with ASA physical status i-iii, aged 18 to 80 years and weight range between 45 to 100kg, scheduled for surgery under general anaesthesia. They were randomized into 2 groups according to the pharmacokinetic model: Modified Marsh group and Schnider group. The haemodynamic changes that occurred during the induction and intubation were analysed. A propofol target controlled infusion was started to achieve and maintain a bispectral index value between 35 and 55. At minute 6, orotracheal intubation was performed and the study finished at minute 11. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and their product (HR×MAP) were measured and recorded every minute throughout the study. Every HR×MAP value was compared to its baseline value to determine the minimum value before intubation, the maximum value after intubation, the maximum variation after intubation, and its final value. The GRADIENTE (MIN, MAX) variable (primary endpoint of this study) analyses the difference between maximal and minimal values related to intubation. Propofol doses and calculated concentrations and any hypotensive events were also recorded.
No differences were found between groups regarding haemodynamic performance. GRADIENTE (MIN, MAX) values and the percentage of hypotensive events were: Modified Marsh group median 77.41% vs. Schnider group 84.86% (p= 0.821) and 17.3% vs. 12.8% (p = 0.292), respectively.
The study failed to demonstrate any haemodynamic difference between the 2 groups, even though the Modified Marsh group received a larger dose of propofol.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25600619/

A total of 40 consecutive patients (20 per group) undergoing brainstem surgery were randomly assigned to 2 groups receiving either 0.5 MAC sevoflurane or propofol at an effect-site concentration of 2.5 µg/mL for maintenance of anesthesia. Remifentanil was administered to both groups at a rate of 0.25 to 0.35 μg/kg/min along with cisatracurium (0.03 to 0.04 mg/kg/h). TceMEP recordings were carried out in the abductor pollicis brevis, abductor hallucis, and tibialis anterior muscles, whereas cortical SSEPs were measured with posterior tibial nerve stimulation. Amplitudes and latencies of TceMEPs and SSEPs were recorded at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the induction of anesthesia.
BIS values remained in the 45 to 60 range. Amplitudes of TceMEPs were significantly higher in the propofol group than those in the sevoflurane group (P<0.05, at all study time points in abductor pollicis brevis and abductor hallucis muscles and only 4 h after anesthetic induction for tibialis anterior muscle), whereas latencies were shorter in the propofol group than those in the sevoflurane group (P<0.05). No differences were observed in latency and amplitude while recording SSEPs between the 2 anesthetic techniques. None of the patients had TceMEPs and SSEPs amplitude or latency changes, exceeding our set limit.

Retrospective study approved By Committee For The Protection Of Human Subjects at University Of Texas Medical School at Houston.
University-affiliated children's hospital.
The records of pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia for electrophysiology procedures were analyzed. Electronic data collected included Bispectral Index (BIS) values, anesthetics (eg, opioids, expired concentration of inhaled anesthetics, muscle relaxants), hemodynamic values (ie, heart rate, invasive blood pressure), respiratory parameters [ie, tidal volume, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2)], and routine arterial blood gases. These parameters were analyzed 10 minutes prior to the start of the isoproterenol infusion (T-pre) and 10 minutes after isoproterenol had reduced the cardiac cycle length by 20% (T-infusion).
Of the 29 records that were screened, 22 met the above criteria (mean age 13 ± 5 yrs). BIS values increased by an average of 8 (33 ± 8 to 41 ± 10; P < 0.001) during the isoproterenol infusion. Statistically significant increases in ETCO2 (median 33 - 36 mmHg; P = 0.01), PaCO2 (35 - 38 mmHg; P = 0.002), and lactate (1.1 -1.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001) occurred with infusion of isoproterenol. Patients undergoing controlled mechanical ventilation showed an increase in ETCO2 (mean 34 ± 6 mmHg to 37 ± 5 mmHg; P = 0.001) whereas those breathing spontaneously had an increase in minute ventilation (average increase 111 ± 30 mL/kg).
Isoproterenol increases metabolic, respiratory, and BIS values in pediatric patients during general anesthesia. We recommend the use of BIS, close monitoring of ETCO2, and careful titration of anesthetics during isoproterenol infusion, especially when lighter planes of general anesthesia are requested for pediatric electrophysiologic procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25439399/

While sedation assessment is well established in critical care in general, there is only little data available relating to the special conditions during patient transport and their effect on patient sedation levels. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the feasibility and relationship of clinical sedation assessment (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS)) and objective physiological monitoring (bispectral index (BIS)) during patient transfers in our Mobile-ICU.
The levels of sedation of 30 pharmacologically sedated patients were evaluated at 12 to 17 distinct measurement points spread strategically over the course of a transfer by use of the RASS and BIS. To investigate the relation between the RASS and the BIS, Spearman's squared rank correlation coefficient (ρ(2)) and the Kendall's rank correlation coefficient (τ) were calculated. The diagnostic value of the BIS with respect to the RASS was investigated by its sensitivity and positive predictive value for possible patient awakening. Therefore, measurements were dichotomized considering a clinically sensible threshold of 80 for BIS-values and classifying RASS values being nonnegative.
Spearman's rank correlation resulted to ρ(2) = 0.431 (confidence interval (CI) = 0.341 to 0.513). The Kendall's correlation coefficient was calculated as τ = 0.522 (CI = 0.459 to 0.576). Awakening of patients (RASS ≥ 0) was detected by a BIS value of 80 and above with a sensitivity of 0.97 (CI = 0.89 to 1.00) and a positive predictive value of 0.59 (CI = 0.45 to 0.71).
Our study demonstrates that the BIS-Monitor can be used for the assessment of sedation levels in the intricate environment of a Mobile-ICU, especially when well-established clinical scores as the RASS are impracticable. The use of BIS is highly sensitive in the detection of unwanted awakening of patients during transfers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25418521/

Alternatively, deep sedation and analgesia may be required.
The aim of our study was to compare the Bispectral Index (BIS) and Comfort Score (CS) with respect to their clinical significance for sedation/analgesia in children undergoing open muscle biopsy.
Thirty pediatric patients subjected to open muscle biopsy for diagnosis of their underlying disease were prospectively enrolled. Sedation/analgesia was performed in all patients using remifentanil and propofol. The patients were simultaneously monitored using the CS and BIS.
All sedations and muscle biopsies were performed uneventfully. The CS and BIS were significantly correlated (R = 0.589; P < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.918 with a maximum cut-off point of BIS 70.5 (sensitivity 0.9; specificity 0.785) for adequate sedation. Sensitivity of 100% was achieved at BIS 60. Accordingly, all patients with BIS ≤60 had CS within the target range of 10-14. The BIS showed substantial intra- and interindividual variability (30 points and 58 points, respectively) during sedation, whereas CS varied only within close ranges during sedation. In 25 patients, sedatives were reduced according to low BIS values (<60). No unintended anesthesia awareness was noted during the study period.
Bispectral Index provides an additional helpful tool to guide sedation/analgesia in minor surgical procedures in children. BIS values ≤60 correlated with sufficient depth of sedation and prevented unintended awareness. Additionally, BIS measurement allowed for distinct regulation of depth of sedation without prolonged sedation/analgesia due to unintended overdose.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25279930/

Prospective, explorative clinical study included 20 patients, ASA physical status 1 or 2, at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden, from November 2012 to January 2013 scheduled for elective breast tumour surgery. A general anaesthesia was delivered with inhalation of oxygen, nitrous oxide and sevoflurane anaesthesia to a depth of 1.2 minimal alveolar concentration. Sevoflurane inspiratory and expiratory concentrations were measured. Bispectral index monitoring, PV as measured by pulse oximeter, heart rate and carbon dioxide were registered at before anaesthesia, 15 min after induction (at 1.2 minimal alveolar concentration), at end of surgery and at eye opening at the end of anaesthesia. PV values were lower before anaesthesia and at eye opening compared to at 15 min after induction and at end of surgery (P < 0.05). The reduction of PV between end of surgery and eye opening was 0.76.

Drugs such as thiopental, which have been prescribed for anesthesia required for ECT, are known as drugs with cognitive effects. This pilot randomized clinical trial tried to assess the feasibility of using a lower dose of thiopental in combination with remifentanil instead of a higher challenging dose of a single drug with cognitive side effects such as thiopental. We evaluated post-ECT cognitive impairment in patients who received remifentanil-thiopental compared with thiopental-placebo group.
One hundred twenty patients with psychiatric disorders between the ages of 18 and 60 years were enrolled. The patients were randomized into 2 groups who received either thiopental sodium (4 mg/kg) and remifentanil (1 μg/kg) or thiopental sodium (3 mg/kg, placebo). The psychiatric patients were examined using mini-mental state examination in terms of the cognitive deficits before ECT as well as 5 and 24 hours after ECT. Statistical analyses were done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16. Unpaired t test, χ2 test, and analysis of variance were used to determine the association of variables.
All the patients completed the trial. There were no reports of adverse effects. In terms of depth of anesthesia measured by bispectral index, no significant difference was observed. Regarding mini-mental state examination scores, the difference was not statistically significant.

Intraoperative anesthetic depth may impact recovery, but the impact of brain monitoring on time to extubation and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay after cardiac surgery has not been extensively studied. Our goal was to determine if BIS-guided anesthesia improves time to extubation compared to MAC-guided anesthesia in a cardiac surgery population.
In this secondary outcome analysis of a randomized controlled study, we analyzed 294 patients undergoing elective coronary bypass grafting, valve replacements, and bypass plus valve replacements at a single tertiary referral center between February 1, 2009 and April 30, 2010. We analyzed cardiac surgery patients that had been randomized to BIS-guided anesthesia alerts (n = 131) or MAC-guided anesthesia alerts (n = 163). The primary outcome measure was time to extubation in the BIS-guided and anesthetic concentration-guided groups. Secondary outcomes were length of stay in the ICU and total postoperative hospital length of stay.
Valid extubation time data were available for 247 of 294 patients. The median [IQR] time to extubation was 307 [215 to 771] minutes in the BIS group and 323 [196 to 730] minutes in the anesthetic concentration group (p = 0.61). The median [IQR] ICU length of stay was 54 [29 to 97] hours versus 70 [44 to 99] hours (p = 0.11). In terms of postoperative hospital length of stay, there was no difference between the groups with median [IQR] times of 6 [5-8] days (p = 0.69) in each group.
The use of intraoperative BIS monitoring during cardiac surgery did not change time to extubation, ICU length of stay or hospital length of stay. Data regarding BIS monitoring and recovery in an exclusively cardiac surgery population are consistent with recent effectiveness studies in the general surgical population.

Today, electroencephalogram-based monitors promise a more specific assessment of the brain function. To date, most approaches were focused on a ""head-to-head"" comparison of either electroencephalogram- or standard parameter-based monitoring. In the current study, a multimodal indicator based on a combination of both electro encephalographic and standard anesthesia monitoring parameters is defined for quantification of ""anesthesia depth.""
Two hundred sixty-three adult patients from six European centers undergoing surgery with general anesthesia were assigned to 1 of 10 anesthetic combinations according to standards of the enrolling hospital. The anesthesia multimodal index of consciousness was developed using a data-driven approach, which maps standard monitoring and electroencephalographic parameters into an output indicator that separates different levels of anesthesia from awake to electroencephalographic burst suppression. Obtained results were compared with either a combination of standard monitoring parameters or the electroencephalogram-based bispectral index.
The anesthesia multimodal index of consciousness showed prediction probability (P(K)) of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.97) to separate different levels of anesthesia (wakefulness to burst suppression), whereas the bispectral index had significantly lower PK of 0.80 (0.76 to 0.81) at corrected threshold P value of less than 0.05. At the transition between consciousness and unconsciousness, anesthesia multimodal index of consciousness yielded a PK of 0.88 (0.85 to 0.91).

The aEEG, Spectral Edge Frequency 90% (SEF90) and Bispectral Index™ (BIS) were investigated in a prospective study of children <2 years of age. After anesthetic induction, and caudal block administration, EEG data were collected simultaneously with BrainZ BRM2™ and BIS™ monitors. Using a randomized crossover design, children received up to three age adjusted concentrations of sevoflurane: 0.75, 1 and 1.25 MAC. After 15 min of stable anesthetic delivery EEG readings were obtained. Prediction Probability (Pk ) and correlation coefficients were calculated for each EEG parameter.
From 51 children 102 stable anesthetics concentrations were obtained. For all age groups Pk of aEEG to multiple of age adjusted MAC was <0.72 indicating a poor predictive power for aEEG. In contrast for the SEF90 and BIS there was evidence for better predictive properties in children aged between 6 months and 2 years, with a Pk >0.81.
The aEEG is unlikely to be a useful measure of anesthesia depth in young children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24612073/

The aim of this study was to analyze the physicochemical properties, pharmacodynamic effect, and pharmaceutical and clinical equivalence of the reference drug propofol as well as a similar formulation.
Sixteen volunteers were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, and paired study of Diprivan® and Propovan® formulations. Formulations were given as target-controlled infusion with target concentration of 3.0 μg.mL(-1) for 15 minutes. Variables studied were the area under the curve (AUC) of the bispectral index (BIS) graph regarding time, minimum BIS reached and time to reach it, and recovery time. The two formulations were sent to analysis of particle size of lipid emulsion, surface potential, and active principle quantification.
There was no difference between the formulations when comparing AUC, minimum BIS reached and time to reach it. The similar formulation recovery time was lower compared to the reference formulation (eight and 10 min, respectively, p = 0.014). Mean particle size of lipid emulsion, surface potential, and active ingredient quantification were similar for both formulations.
There was no clinically significant difference between the use of propofol, reference Diprivan®, and the similar Propovan® during infusion. However, the recovery time was longer with the reference drug. Although analysis of both formulations studied show similar results regarding its physicochemical characterization, further studies should be conducted to justify this difference.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24565090/

Eleven children between the ages of 1 month and 16 years requiring mechanical ventilation and sedation were simultaneously classified based on the bispectral index and the Comfort-B scale. Their behavior was recorded using digital photography, and the record was later evaluated by three independent evaluators. Agreement tests (Bland-Altman and Kappa) were then performed. The correlation between the two methods (Pearson correlation) was tested.
In total, 35 observations were performed on 11 patients. Based on the Kappa coefficient, the agreement among evaluators ranged from 0.56 to 0.75 (p<0.001). There was a positive and consistent association between the bispectral index and the Comfort-B scale [r=0.424 (p=0.011) to r=0.498 (p=0.002)].
Due to the strong correlation between the independent evaluators and the consistent correlation between the two methods, the results suggest that the Comfort-B scale is reproducible and useful in classifying the level of sedation in children requiring mechanical ventilation.

Recently, the surgical pleth index (SPI) derived by finger plethysmography was introduced to detect nociceptive stimulation during anaesthesia. While SPI guidance reduced the number of unwanted events during total i.v. anaesthesia (TIVA), the impact of SPI during volatile-based anaesthesia with intermittent opioid administration has not yet been elucidated.
Ninety-four patients were randomized into either SPI-guided analgesia or standard practice (Control). In both groups, anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane to keep bispectral index values between 40 and 60. In the SPI group, patients received a sufentanil bolus (10 μg) whenever SPI value increased above 50, whereas in the control group, sufentanil was administered according to standard clinical practice. The number of unwanted somatic events, haemodynamics, sufentanil consumption, and recovery times were recorded.
The incidence of intraoperative unwanted somatic events was comparable between the groups (P=0.89). No significant differences with respect to hypotensive or hypertensive events were found. The mean (95% confidence interval) sufentanil consumption was non-significantly (P=0.07) reduced in the SPI group, 0.64 (0.57-0.71) vs 0.78 (0.64-0.91) µg min(-1). Recovery times were comparable between the groups.
Sufentanil administration guided by SPI during sevoflurane anaesthesia is clinically feasible. In contrast to TIVA, it did not improve anaesthesia conduct with respect to unwanted somatic events, haemodynamic stability, sufentanil consumption, emergence time, or post-anaesthesia care unit care. Therefore, we conclude that anaesthesia regimen has an impact on beneficial effects by SPI guidance. Clinical trial registration NCT01525537.

In particular, variation of R-R peak interval (RRI) of electrocardiography appears regularly oscillatory in deeper levels of anaesthesia and less regular in lighter levels of anaesthesia. We proposed a new index, non-rhythmic-to-rhythmic ratio (NRR), to quantify this feature and investigated its potential to estimate depth of anaesthesia.
Thirty-one female patients were enrolled in this prospective study. The oscillatory pattern transition of RRI was visualised by the time-varying power spectrum and quantified by NRR. The prediction of anaesthetic events, including skin incision, first reaction of motor movement during emergence period, loss of consciousness (LOC) and return of consciousness (ROC) by NRR were evaluated by serial prediction probability (PK ) analysis; the ability to predict the decrease of effect-site sevoflurane concentration was also evaluated. The results were compared with Bispectral Index (BIS).
NRR well-predicted first reaction (PK  > 0.90) 30 s ahead, earlier than BIS and significantly better than HRV indices. NRR well-correlated with sevoflurane concentration, although its correlation was inferior to BIS, while HRV indices had no such correlation. BIS indicated LOC and ROC best.

The goal of the present study was to investigate whether the median (50%) effective effect-concentration (EC50) of propofol inducing loss of consciousness (LOC) varies between the luteal and the follicular phases of the menstrual cycle.
Twenty-two patients (follicular phase) and 20 patients (luteal phase) undergoing gynaecological procedures under general anaesthesia were enrolled on the study. Anaesthesia was conducted with a target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol. The initial target effect-site propofol concentration (Ceprop) was 3.5 µg ml(-1) and was adjusted stepwise by 0.5 µg ml(-1) at 4 min intervals by an up-down sequential method to reach LOC. Anaesthesia was maintained with a propofol TCI guided by the bispectral index. The correlation between female sex hormones and predicted Ceprop at the time of LOC was analysed and emergence time from anaesthesia was recorded.
Propofol EC50 to induce LOC was higher in patients in the follicular phase than those in the luteal phase (4.17 vs 3.58 µg ml(-1), P<0.05). Progesterone correlated significantly with Ceprop at LOC. Emergence time was also longer in the follicular group than in the luteal group (6.5 vs 5.0 min, P<0.05).
During general anaesthesia, patients in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle had a lower propofol EC50 for LOC and a shorter emergence time compared with those in the follicular phase. Differences in progesterone levels between menstrual phases may contribute to these anaesthetic effects.

The target concentration of remifentanil was kept constant throughout the operation, and the bispectral index indicated that propofol infusion was not required during the anhepatic and neohepatic phases of the operation. The measured plasma propofol concentrations during the neohepatic phase were far below the usual values that are used to maintain anesthesia. However, the bispectral index indicated a state of unconsciousness. The patient regained consciousness rapidly several minutes after administration of neostigmine and cessation of remifentanil infusion. The measured plasma propofol concentrations were similar before and after recovery of consciousness. The possible mechanisms for the maintenance of anesthesia at reduced propofol concentrations are multifactorial and may be related to reduced liver function as well as an interaction between propofol and remifentanil or the use of a neuromuscular relaxant to suppress somatic afferent activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24209988/

Thirty patients who underwent tonsillectomy under general anesthesia (GA) were included. Patients were assigned randomly to one of two groups: group 1 (n = 15) received propofol, group 2 (n = 15) sevoflurane as anesthetic agent. The sedation level was assessed by the bispectral index system. DPOAE measurements were performed before premedication (T 1), 5 min after premedication (T 2), 3 min after induction of general anesthesia (T 3) and every 10 min (T 4, T 5) thereafter until the end of surgery at about 23 min post-anesthetic induction, while sedation levels were obtained starting at the beginning until the end of anesthesia. After premedication, both blood oxygen saturation and heart rate decreased. Following induction of anesthesia systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased, while, as expected, the level of sedation increased. Analyzing the propofol and sevoflurane group separately, both groups showed comparable overall courses of DPOAE levels at higher frequencies (2.8 kHz p = 0.310, 4 kHz p = 0.193, 6 kHz p = 0.269, 8 kHz p = 0.223) and no changes of DPOAE levels compared with baseline values were observed. At T5 the 1 kHz DPOAE level increased in the propofol group and slightly decreased in the sevoflurane group (p < 0.001). While the 1.4 kHz DPOAE level in the propofol group did not change over time the 1.4 kHz DPOAE level decreased in the sevoflurane group (baseline to T 4 p = 0.045; Baseline to T 5 p = 0.004). While overall there were different courses between these two groups in the 2 kHz DPOAE level, in the post hoc analysis only a tendency in the change from baseline to T 4 could be observed (p = 0.082). These results indicate that while the amplitudes of certain DPOAEs were influenced by GA, the depth of anesthesia had no effect on this measure of cochlear function in clinical routine. Therefore, DPOAE measurements in sedation and during GA are useful but the effect of anesthetic agents on DPOAE levels needs to be taken into account when analyzing the test.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24150547/

Near-infrared spectroscopy has been described as a non-invasive, continuous method to monitor cerebral oxygen saturation. However, its impact on neurobehavioral outcome comparing different anesthesia regimens has been poorly described.
In this prospective, assessor-blinded study, 90 patients undergoing shoulder surgery in beach chair position following general (G-group, n=45) or regional anesthesia (R-group; n=45) were enrolled to assess the prevalence of cerebral desaturation events comparing anesthesia regimens and their impact on neurobehavioral and neurological outcome. Anesthesiologists were blinded to regional cerebral oxygen saturation values. Baseline data assessed the day before surgery included neurological and neurobehavioral tests, which were repeated the day after surgery. The baseline data for regional cerebral oxygen saturation/bispectral index and invasive blood pressure both at heart and auditory meatus levels were taken prior to anesthesia, 5 min after induction of anesthesia, 5 min after beach chair positioning, after skin incision and thereafter all 20 min until discharge.
Patients in the R-group showed significantly less cerebral desaturation events (p<0.001), drops in regional cerebral oxygen saturation values (p<0.001), significantly better neurobehavioral test results the day after surgery (p<0.001) and showed a greater hemodynamic stability in the beach chair position compared to patients in the G-group.

This prospective study included mechanically ventilated patients. BIS values were blindly recorded continuously. A Ramsay score was performed every 5 min. The main judgement criterion was the correlation between BIS values and the Ramsay score.
72 patients were included, mostly presenting with toxic coma (36%) or neurological coma (21%). The median (IQR) BIS value was 85 (84-86) when the Ramsay score was 3, 80 (76-84) when the Ramsay score was 4, 61 (55-80) when the Ramsay score was 5 and 45 (38-60) when the Ramsay score was 6.

Three minutes after propofol administration, the BIS values and Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scores were recorded.
There were no significant differences in the prediction probability of BIS for detecting LOC in the three groups. At the time of LOC, BIS50 values were 71.1 and 71.4 in the dexmedetomidine 0.5 and 1.0 µg kg-1 groups, respectively, which were significantly larger than the BIS50 of 63.2 in the control group.
The ability of BIS to predict LOC is not influenced by dexmedetomidine during propofol administration, but BIS values are enhanced at the time of LOC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23519436/

The Surgical pleth index (SPI), derived from photoplethysmography, was proposed as a surrogate measure of nociception. Recently, the analgesia nociception index (ANI) derived by heart rate (HR) variability was developed. The aim of the present study was to challenge the ability of ANI compared with SPI to detect standardized noxious stimulation during propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia.
After Ethics approval and informed consent, 25 patients were anaesthetized with propofol [bispectral index (BIS) 30-60]. A laryngeal mask (LMA) was inserted and remifentanil stepwise increased to effect-site concentrations (Ce(remi)) of 0, 2, and 4 ng ml(-1). At each step, tetanic stimulation (STIM) was applied. ANI, SPI, BIS, HR, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were obtained before and after LMA insertion and each STIM. Analysis was performed using Wilcoxon rank tests and calculation of prediction probabilities (P(K)).
ANI and SPI, but not BIS, HR, or MAP, were significantly (P<0.05) changed at all examined steps. ANI response to STIM was (median [IQR]) -24 [-12-35], -30 [-20 - -40] and -13 [-5 - -27] at 0, 2 and 4 ng ml(-1) Ce(remi). However, prediction of movement to STIM was not better than by chance, as P(K) values were 0.41 (0.08) for ANI and 0.62 (0.08) for SPI.
The two variables, ANI and SPI, enabled consistent reflection of stimulation during propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia. Nevertheless, ANI and SPI may improve detection but not prediction of a possible inadequate nociception-anti-nociception balance. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier.

The present study compared the changes of cAAI, AAI, and BIS in different sevoflurane concentration. Forty-five adult patients were anesthetized with sevoflurane in 50 % nitrous oxide. AAI (AEP version 1.4), cAAI (AEP version 1.6), and BIS (A-2000) were compared (each 15 patients in AAI, cAAI, and BIS groups) before induction, just before and after intubation, at 10 min since sevoflurane was set to 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 %, and after extubation. All three indices decreased significantly before intubation. The cAAI was significantly higher than the AAI at sevoflurane 1.0 and 1.5 %. The AAI and BIS were significantly lower at sevoflurane 2.0 % than those at sevoflurane 1.0 %, but the cAAI did not. The cAAI had the largest and AAI had the smallest inter-individual variation.

The purpose of this pilot study was to compare the cerebral physiologic effects of sedation with propofol versus dexmedetomidine in mechanically-ventilated, brain-injured patients. Using a randomised, crossover, unblinded clinical trial, we enrolled patients with severe brain injury (Glasgow Coma Score ≤8) from traumatic injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage or intracerebral haemorrhage undergoing multimodal monitoring (intracranial pressure, brain temperature, oximetry and microdialysis). Patients received an infusion of either propofol or dexmedetomidine for six hours and then a crossover for the subsequent six hours after sufficient washout/in. Clinical and physiological measurements were recorded hourly. In eight patients, (four traumatic injury, three subarachnoid haemorrhage and one intracerebral haemorrhage), the mean dose of propofol used was 25.5 µg/kg/minute while the mean dose of dexmedetomidine was 0.54 µg/kg/hour. All subjects were effectively sedated to a goal of Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale -2 and Bispectral Index of 50-70 throughout the study period. We did not observe any statistically significant differences between the groups in systemic or cerebral physiologic metrics. Though differences were noted in cerebral metabolic substrates (lactate/pyruvate ratio), none were statistically significant. In our pilot cohort, dexmedetomidine and propofol appear equally effective in sedating severely brain-injured patients and neither is associated with adverse physiological effects as measured by multimodal monitoring.

Movement of the patient or hemodynamic variations are usually considered as symptoms of insufficient analgesia. The measure of skin conductance (SC) allows an assessment of peripheral sympathetic activity. The analgesia-nociception index (ANI) provides an evaluation of the parasympathetic activity based on heart rate variability. These two non-invasive monitors might allow a better assessment of perioperative nociception.
Describe the profiles of SC and ANI after a standardized nociceptive stimulation, in anesthetized children, at different infusion rates of remifentanil.
For this pilot study, 12 children (8.4 ± 5 years) scheduled for middle-ear surgery were anesthetized with desflurane to maintain a bispectral index at 50. Remifentanil was used for analgesia, at an initial infusion rate of 0.2 μg·kg(-1) ·min(-1) . Remifentanil infusion rate was then decreased: Five steady-state periods of 10 min were obtained at 0.2, 0.16, 0.12, 0.08, and 0.04 μg·kg(-1) ·min(-1) . At the end of each period, a standardized tetanic stimulation was applied to the patient. Variations in heart rate, blood pressure, SC, and ANI were recorded before and after each stimulation.
After the stimulation, ANI was significantly decreased compared with prestimulation values for all remifentanil infusion rates. This decrease was greater at 0.04 μg·kg(-1) ·min(-1) than at the other infusion rates. SC, heart rate, and blood pressure were not modified by the stimulations, whatever the dose of remifentanil.

We wanted to examine these methods during noxious stimulation during general anaesthesia and if the responses were associated with variability in genes related to pain.
Sixty patients, given propofol to a BIS level of 40-50, were stimulated with standardised tetanic electrical stimuli during propofol infusion, plasma level of 3 μg/ml alone, or together with remifentanil target plasma level of 3 ng/ml or 10 ng/ml. The CSS, SC, BIS index and the variability of the BIS index were registered. The inter-individual variation in nociceptive responses was analysed for co-variation with genotypes of 89 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 23 candidate genes.
During tetanic stimuli, CSS and SC increased significantly and were attenuated with increasing level of remifentanil, different from the BIS index and the variation in the BIS index. Polymorphisms in the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), tachykinin 1 receptor (TACR1), dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3) and beta arrestin 2 (ARRB2) genes were associated with the co-variation in SC variables or CSS response or both during standardised nociceptive stimuli (P < 0.05). Because of no corrections for multiple testing, the genetic analyses are explorative, and associations must be tested in further studies.

Its combination with dexmedetomidine may have some advantages for patients. We studied the effects of different loading doses of dexmedetomidine on the bispectral index (BIS) under stepwise propofol TCI.
Forty patients were randomly assigned into groups D(1.0), D(0.5), D(0.25) and D(0), in which dexmedetomidine at 1.0, 0.5, 0.25 or 0 µg•kg(-1) was infused over 10 min followed by 0.5 µg•kg(-1)•h(-1) and stepwise propofol TCI, which was administered with target effect site concentration (Ce) at 0.5 µg•ml(-1), and increased until 2.5 µg•ml(-1) by 1.0 µg•ml(-1) after 5 min reaching target Ce. BIS, heart rate, MAP, pulse oxygen saturation, RR and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure were recorded before loading dose (T(0)), at 5 min (T(5 min)) and 10 min (T(10 min)) after starting infusion, after 5 min reaching Ce of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 µg•ml(-1) (T(p0.5), T(p1.5) and T(p2.5)).
BIS values in group D(1.0) were significantly lower compared with those in group D(0) since T(10 min) and those in groups D(0.5) and D(0.25) since T(p0.5). In group D(1.0), heart rate decreased significantly at T(5 min) and T(10 min), heart rate at T(10 min) was significantly lower compared with that in group D(0).

Brain function monitoring such as the bispectral index (BIS) facilitates anesthetic titration and has been shown to reduce anesthetic exposure. In a randomized controlled trial, we tested the effect of BIS monitoring on POCD in 921 elderly patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either BIS-guided anesthesia or routine care. The BIS group had anesthesia adjusted to maintain a BIS value between 40 and 60 during maintenance of anesthesia. Routine care group had BIS measured but not revealed to attending anesthesiologists. Anesthesia was adjusted according to traditional clinical signs and hemodynamic parameters. A neuropsychology battery of tests was administered before and at 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Results were compared with matched control patients who did not have surgery during the same period. Delirium was measured using the confusion assessment method criteria.
The median (interquartile range) BIS values during the maintenance period of anesthesia were significantly lower in the control group, 36 (31 to 49), compared with the BIS-guided group, 53 (48 to 57), P<0.001. BIS-guided anesthesia reduced propofol delivery by 21% and that for volatile anesthetics by 30%. There were fewer patients with delirium in the BIS group compared with routine care (15.6% vs. 24.1%, P=0.01). Although cognitive performance was similar between groups at 1 week after surgery, patients in the BIS group had a lower rate of POCD at 3 months compared with routine care (10.2% vs. 14.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.98; P=0.025).
BIS-guided anesthesia reduced anesthetic exposure and decreased the risk of POCD at 3 months after surgery.

In 34 patients anaesthetized with propofol using two doses of rocuronium (0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg), we studied whether the EMG arousal can be detected visually on the anaesthesia monitor. The Bispectral Index (BIS) and Entropy biosignals on the monitor were recorded with a video camera, and the one-channel EEG recorded by the Entropy strip was collected on a laptop computer. The recordings and the one-channel EEG were analyzed offline by two experts (anaesthesiologist and neurophysiologist), both with a long experience on anaesthesia-related EEG.
EMG arousal existed in 14/34 and 13/33 patients in the BIS and Entropy biosignals, respectively. The anaesthesiologist detected EMG on the monitor in 7/14 patients with BIS (sensitivity 50%) and in 4/13 patients with Entropy (31%).

The controller used a proportional-integral (PI) algorithm with the bispectral index (BIS) as the feedback signal. Our hypothesis was that a PI closed-loop control could be applied in clinical practice safely keeping the BIS within a pre-determined target range.
The adjustment of the PI parameters was based on simulation. The procedure had three steps: obtaining a patient model using data from 12 patients, designing and adjusting the controller in simulation, and fine tuning the PI parameters in a pilot study (10 patients). The resulting controller was tested in 24 American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) I-II patients. The controller directly decides the infusion rate of propofol, and no model is necessary in its online operation. The BIS target was set to 50. Remifentanil was used for analgesia.
We evaluated the efficiency and safety of the automatic feedback system. It worked properly in all the patients. The median performance error was -1.62, and the median absolute performance error was 11.03. Average propofol-normalized consumption was 5.3 ± 1.8 mg/kg/h. Mean percentage of BIS in the range 40-60 was 83%. Mean time to open eyes was 8 ± 4 min. Time to extubation was 9 ± 5 min. Hemodynamic adverse event or intraoperative awareness were not recorded.
The closed-loop system was able to maintain the BIS within an acceptable range of levels. The control of a propofol infusion guided by the BIS is feasible without hemodynamic instability in ASA I/II patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22834710/

Mechanically ventilated thirty patients who required sedation for any reason were enrolled to study. Patients who needed neuromuscular blockade, patients with known hearing and visual problems, neurological diseases, anoxic encephalopathy, mental retardation and who developed hemodynamic instability (mean arterial pressure below 60 mmHg) and hypoxemia (sPO2 below 90%) during follow-up were excluded. Starting before the initiation of sedation, first BIS scores then clinical sedation scales were evaluated. This procedure is repeated every 2 hours for 24 hours.
All of the four clinical scales were significantly correlated with BIS. BIS and clinical scale values, except Adaptation to Intensive Care Environment scale, showed significant changes compared to baseline after the initiation of sedation. Ramsay and Richmond scales showed the highest correlation with BIS (respectively, r = 0.758, r = 0.750). Adaptation to Intensive Care Environment revealed the lowest correlation (r = 0.565).

The normal response to high minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) fraction of anesthetics is hypotension and low Bispectral Index (BIS) scores. Low MAP and/or BIS at lower MAC fractions may represent anesthetic sensitivity. The authors sought to characterize the effect of the triple low state (low MAP and low BIS during a low MAC fraction) on duration of hospitalization and 30-day all-cause mortality.
Mean intraoperative MAP, BIS, and MAC were determined for 24,120 noncardiac surgery patients at the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio. The hazard ratios associated with combinations of MAP, BIS, and MAC values greater or less than a reference value were determined. The authors also evaluated the association between cumulative triple low minutes, and excess length-of-stay and 30-day mortality.
Means (±SD) defining the reference, low, and high states were 87 ± 5 mmHg (MAP), 46 ± 4 (BIS), and 0.56 ± 0.11 (MAC). Triple lows were associated with prolonged length of stay (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7). Thirty-day mortality was doubled in double low combinations and quadrupled in the triple low group. Triple low duration ≥60 min quadrupled 30-day mortality compared with ≤15 min. Excess length of stay increased progressively from ≤15 min to ≥60 min of triple low.
The occurrence of low MAP during low MAC fraction was a strong and highly significant predictor for mortality. When these occurrences were combined with low BIS, mortality risk was even greater. The values defining the triple low state were well within the range that many anesthesiologists tolerate routinely.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22546967/

Patients in group B were given acupuncture without electrical stimulation at acupuncture points GV24 and EX-HN3 (Yintang) for 6 h simultaneously, and patients in group C were given electroacupuncture to the same points as in group B.
Maintaining the BIS between 60 and 80, the hourly mean one dose of midazolam within the first 6 h after sedation in group C was 0.05 (±0.02 mg/kg per hour), which was significantly lower than both group A (0.08 ± 0.03 mg/kg per hour, p<0.001) and group B (0.07 ± 0.01 mg/kg per hour, p<0.021). The doses in groups A and B showed no significant difference. Between-group comparison analysis of hepatic and renal function and severe adverse reactions all showed no significant difference between the three groups.
Electroacupuncture appears to reduce markedly the dose of sedative drug required in critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation monitored by BIS, without any obvious severe adverse action, and larger studies to confirm the effect are justified.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22459647/

This information was used to establish an optimal BIS range for surgery in these patients and to calculate differences in drug consumption in both groups.
Consecutive patients undergoing implant surgery were studied and randomly assigned to two groups. Patients were sedated using intravenous propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam. The sedation level in group A was measured using the Ramsay scale. In group B, the Ramsay scale and the BIS were used together. Heart rate, blood pressure, and peripheral oxygen saturation were monitored in all patients. The levels of anxiety, satisfaction, and drug consumption were compared between groups.
Forty-three patients were included; 20 were placed in group A and 23 were included in group B. There were no differences in the hemodynamic and respiratory parameters monitored or in anxiety or satisfaction levels in both groups. In group B patients, the BIS values stabilized around 85; the Ramsay scale stabilized around 3 in both groups and remained at these levels until the end of the procedure. Drug consumption was significantly lower in the BIS group.
The optimal BIS value during intravenous sedation in sedated ambulatory patients in dental surgery should be within the 80 to 85 range. BIS monitoring allows for reduced consumption of propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22442778/

However, few studies have involved correlation of bispectral index with serum drug concentrations.
To assess the degree of correlation between bispectral index values, scores on the Sedation-Agitation Scale, and steady-state serum concentrations of lorazepam.
A prospective open-label study of patients in a surgical intensive care unit who were receiving mechanical ventilation and continuous infusions of lorazepam for more than 24 hours. Bispectral index was measured (BIS-XP, Aspect Medical, Norwood, Massachusetts) to assess patients' sedation. Sensors were applied and values recorded before and after stimulation (endotracheal suctioning). Concomitant plasma samples were obtained to measure lorazepam concentration and scores on the Sedation-Agitation Scale were recorded.
Sixteen patients were studied. Correlations between plasma concentrations of lorazepam and measurements of bispectral index for 1, 2, and 3 minutes before endotracheal stimulation were poor (0.21, 0.29, and 0.25, respectively). Correlation of peak values for bispectral index (after stimulation) with plasma concentrations of lorazepam was 0.29. Correlations of scores on the Sedation-Agitation Scale with the aforementioned values for bispectral index were similarly poor. Area under the curve for bispectral index values also correlated poorly with plasma concentration of lorazepam (0.19) and score on the Sedation-Agitation Scale (0.10).
The correlation between bispectral index and score on the Sedation-Agitation Scale was poor. Correlation between bispectral index and plasma concentration of lorazepam was modestly better, but insufficient for clinical utility.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22381986/

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of induction with high concentration sevoflurane and of nasotracheal intubation without muscle relaxant in infants with increased or decreased pulmonary blood flow (PBF) and undergoing surgery for congenital heart diseases.
Fifty-five infants aged 2 - 12 months, weighing 4.7 - 10.0 kg, and scheduled for congenital cardiac surgery were enrolled. Subjects were divided into those with increased (IPBF group, n = 29) and decreased (DPBF group, n = 26) pulmonary blood flow. All infants received inhalational induction with 8% sevoflurane in 100.0% oxygen at a gas flow rate of 6 L/min. Nasotracheal intubation was performed 4 minutes after induction. Sevoflurane vaporization was decreased to 4.0% for placement of a peripheral intravenous line and invasive hemodynamic monitors. Five minutes later, sedatives and muscle relaxant were administered and the vaporizer was adjusted to 2% for maintenance of anesthesia. Bispectral index (BIS) scores, circulatory parameters, satisfactory and successful intubation ratios, adverse reactions, and complications of intubation were recorded.
Times to loss of lash and pain reflexes were longer for the DPBF group (P < 0.01). Satisfactory intubation ratios were 93.1% and 61.5% for the IPBF and DPBF groups, respectively (P = 0.008). Successful intubation ratios were 96.6% and 76.9% for the IPBF and DPBF groups, respectively (P = 0.044). Following sevoflurane inhalation, blood pressures decreased significantly in the IPBF group but remained stable in the DPBF group. BIS scores declined to similar stable values, and a ""nadir BIS"" was recorded for both groups. No obvious adverse reactions or complications of intubation were noted perioperatively.
Induction with high concentration sevoflurane, although faster for infants with IPBF, is safe for infants with IPBF or DPBF. However, nasotracheal intubation without muscle relaxant after induction with high concentration sevoflurane is less successful and less satisfactory for infants with DPBF and should be used with caution in this patient group.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22340376/

In clinical practice, we have noticed a rise in the numerical values of bispectral index (BIS) and Entropy, two electroencephalogram (EEG) - based depth of anesthesia monitors, during the reversal of the NMB with sugammadex. The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study was to test this impression and to compare the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on the BIS and Entropy values during the reversal of the NMB.
Thirty patients undergoing gynecological operations were studied. Patients were anesthetized with target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil, and rocuronium was used to induce NMB. After operation, during light propofol-remifentanil anesthesia, NMB was antagonized with sugammadex or neostigmine. During the following 5 min, the numerical values of BIS, BIS electromyographic (BIS EMG) and Entropy were recorded on a laptop computer, as well as the biosignal recorded by the Entropy strip. The Entropy biosignal was studied off-line both in time and frequency domain to see if NMB reversal causes changes in EEG.
In some patients, administration of sugammadex or neostigmine caused a significant rise in the numerical values of BIS, BIS EMG and Entropy. This phenomenon was most likely caused by increased electromyographic (EMG) activity. The administration of sugammadex or neostigmine appeared to have only minimal effect on EEG.
The EMG contamination of EEG causes BIS and Entropy values to rise during reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB in light propofol-remifentanil anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22289106/

However, its clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) sedative effects are not yet described in children. The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to assess clinical and EEG effects of increasing intravenous (IV) doses of GHB in burn children requiring sedation for burn wound cares.
Thirty six children hospitalized in a burn care unit were included and randomly assigned into three groups (G) according to the single IV dose of GHB they received before burn wound care: 10 mg · kg(-1) in G10, 25 mg · kg(-1) in G25, or 50 mg · kg(-1) in G50. All patients received oral premedication (morphine and hydroxyzine) 30 min before GHB injection. Respiratory rate, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index (BIS) were continuously monitored. Depth of sedation was clinically assessed using Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS) Score, every 2 min until recovery (i.e., OAAS = 4).
Median age was 17.5 [12-34] months. Whatever the dose, BIS decreased after IV GHB. Nadir value of BIS was significantly lower in G25 and G50 than in G10, as was for OAAS score. Nadir values were reached after same delays in G25 and G50. Duration of sedation was dose-dependent.
Bispectral index decreased after GHB injection and was correlated with OAAS score. Deep sedation can be safely achieved with IV doses of 25 or 50 mg · kg(-1), but the last dose was associated with prolonged duration of clinical sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22151064/

In the present study, we evaluate the alternative AEP-based auditory-evoked potential index (aepEX) for the measurement of hypnotic depth in patients undergoing general anaesthesia with xenon.
Forty-two patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery were enrolled in this controlled, double-blinded, randomized, clinical study. Patients were randomized to receive either xenon (n=21) or sevoflurane anaesthesia (n=21). During anaesthesia, BIS values were recorded simultaneously with the aepEX monitoring. The anaesthetist performing the anaesthesia was blinded to the hypnotic depth monitors. After surgery, the incidence of recalls and awareness was evaluated.
Patients' characteristics such as gender, age, and weight did not differ between the groups. The aepEX and BIS values behaved similarly during anaesthesia. The comparison of aepEX values during xenon and sevoflurane anaesthesia revealed significantly lower aepEX values in the xenon group after 25 min [xenon: 32.9 (4.8) vs sevoflurane: 39.3 (9.0); P=0.008] and after 35 min [xenon: 31.4 (6.6) vs sevoflurane: 37.0 (6.8); P=0.012]. During anaesthesia, aepEX values correlated with the clinical evaluation of depth of anaesthesia (e.g. >20% changes of the baseline arterial pressure or heart rate, spontaneous breathing and/or intolerance of mechanical ventilation, coughing, abdominal pressing, sweating, eye tearing).
We found the aepEX monitor to provide index in the range of adequate depth of xenon anaesthesia, when combined with remifentanil infusion in intubated patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22139005/

The mean lowest blood pressure was lower in the study group. Logistic regression revealed male gender, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, and electrocautery were associated with hypoxemia, whereas lower propofol dose for induction was associated with hypotension in the study group.

Stimulant medication is often continued until the morning of surgery to optimize perioperative behavior. It is unknown whether such stimulant drug ingestion can affect cerebral arousal and alter depth of anesthesia. A clinically relevant alteration in measured depth of anesthesia could form the basis for an evidence-based recommendation that children taking stimulant medications require a change in the amount of anesthetic delivered or that they require routine monitoring of depth of anesthesia.
Thirty-four ASA 1 and 2 children aged between 5 and 16, presenting for elective day case surgery, were recruited. Seventeen had a diagnosis of ADHD and had taken stimulant medication on the day of surgery, and 17 were controls. A standard inhalational induction of anesthesia using air, oxygen, and sevoflurane by facemask was performed and maintained for 10 min at 1 MAC endtidal sevoflurane. During this time, no other stimulus was applied to the patient. Bispectral index (BIS) and other markers of depth of anesthesia were recorded after 10 min.
Children in both groups were of similar ages and weights. There were a higher percentage of boys in the stimulants group. Baseline physiological parameters were similar in both groups. After induction and equilibration for 10 min of anesthesia at 1 MAC endtidal sevoflurane, there was no significant difference in BIS or clinical markers of depth of anesthesia.
Children taking stimulant medication for ADHD, and who ingest medication on the day of surgery, do not appear to have altered BIS or depth of anesthesia at 1 MAC of sevoflurane.

The bispectral index (BIS) monitor incorporated hardware and software changes to eliminate artifacts, thus allowing BIS monitoring even in the presence of electrocautery. We evaluated the accuracy of BIS to measure anesthetic effect during electrocautery interference.
Anesthesia was induced and maintained with target-controlled infusions of propofol (3 μg/mL) and remifentanil (4 ng/mL). After baseline BIS recordings, ""simulated"" electrocautery interference was induced continuously for 20 minutes. Five minutes after the start of electrocautery, propofol infusion was increased to achieve an effect site concentration of 6 μg/mL. Patients remained undisturbed during the study. BIS values and signal quality index were recorded continuously.
During electrocautery, there was a significant decrease in signal quality index (mean difference: 16.9; 95% confidence intervals: 15.9-17.9; P<0.001). There was, however, no change in BIS value even after a step increase in propofol infusion from 3 to 6 μg/mL (P=0.93). In 22% of the patients there was a paradoxical increase in BIS values after doubling of propofol concentration. Following cessation of electrocautery, there was a prompt decrease in BIS (P<0.001), indicating a lack of response to the change in anesthetic depth during electrocautery.
Rejecting and filtering artifacts from electrocautery interference reduced the ability of BIS to respond to a change in anesthetic depth. BIS values during electrocautery should be interpreted with caution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21946766/

In rodent brain, bilirubin can enhance γ-aminobutyric acid A/glycinergic synaptic transmission. Etomidate is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic that induces sedation through γ-aminobutyric acid A receptors in the central nervous system. We tested the hypothesis that patients with obstructive jaundice have an altered sensitivity to etomidate.
The study design was a comparison of etomidate requirements to reach a Bispectral Index of 50 in patients with obstructive jaundice versus patients with chronic cholelithiasis and normal bilirubin levels. Etomidate was infused at 30 μg/kg/min until this end point was reached.
The etomidate requirement in the obstructive jaundice group was lower than that in the control group (150±46 μg/kg vs 206±74 μg/kg, P=0.007). The average decrease in etomidate requirement was 56 μg/kg (95% confidence interval: 16-96 μg/kg). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation between serum total bilirubin and etomidate requirement with Pearson r of -0.545, and 95% confidence interval for r value (-0.791 to -0.148).

A unilateral increase or decrease > 10% from baseline was defined as an 'asymmetry'. Asymmetry followed by movement after stimulation was defined as a 'clinically relevant asymmetry'. Asymmetry occurred in 39 out of 42 adults (93%) and in 20 out of 46 children (44%) during surgery and in 24 out of 42 adults (57%) and in 17 out of 46 children (37%) during recovery. Clinically relevant asymmetry was observed in 5 out of 42 adults (12%) and 6 out of 46 children (13%). The incidence of asymmetry was higher in adults during surgery (p = 0.0002).

We studied whether they can differentiate consciousness from unconsciousness during increasing doses of three different anaesthetic agents.
Thirty healthy male volunteers aged 19-30 yr were recruited and divided into three 10-volunteer groups to receive either dexmedetomidine, propofol, or sevoflurane in escalating concentrations at 10 min intervals until loss of consciousness (LOC) was reached. Consciousness was tested at 5 min intervals and after drug discontinuation at 1 min intervals by requesting the subjects to open their eyes. LOC was defined as unresponsiveness to the request and pre-LOC as the last meaningful response. The first meaningful response to the request after drug discontinuation was defined as regaining of consciousness (ROC). For the statistical analysis, pre-LOC and ROC values were pooled to represent the responsive state while LOC values represented the unresponsive state. Prediction probability (P(K)) was estimated with the jack-knife method.
The lowest mean values for BIS, SE, and RE were recorded at LOC with all three drugs. The P(K) values were low for dexmedetomidine (BIS 0.62, SE 0.58, RE 0.59), propofol (BIS 0.73, SE 0.72, RE 0.72), and sevoflurane (BIS 0.70, SE 0.52, RE 0.62).

Fifty-eight patients (18-65 years) with nephrolithiasis undergoing ESWL, having ASA physical status I or II and have normal hearing function tested by audiometry were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Patients were randomized and allocated into two groups: noise blocked group (earplugs inserted into both ears) and control group (earplugs not inserted). Sedation by target-controlled infusion was started with 1.2 mcg/mL of propofol and propofol target concentration was adjusted gradually by 0.2 mcg/ml every 5 minutes intraoperatively to achieve and maintain bispectral index (BIS) values within 75-80% until the procedure finished. Total amount of propofol (mg), BIS values (%), ambient noise level (dB) and patient satisfaction (1-5) were measured.

Some investigators use a population pharmacokinetic model from existing literature and minimize the pharmacodynamic objective function. The purpose of the study was to determine whether this method selects the best-performing pharmacokinetic model in a set and provides accurate estimates of pharmacodynamic parameters in models for bispectral index in children after propofol administration.
Twenty-eight children classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 who were given general anesthesia for dental treatment were studied. Anesthesia was given using target-controlled infusion of propofol based on the Kataria model. Propofol target plasma concentration was 7 μg/ml for 15 min, followed by 1 μg/ml for 15 min or until signs of awakening, followed by 5 μg/ml for 15 min. Venous blood samples were taken 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min after each change in target. A classic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was estimated, and the methodology of other studies was duplicated using pharmacokinetic models from the literature and (re-)estimating the pharmacodynamic models.
There is no clear relationship between pharmacokinetic precision and the pharmacodynamic objective function. Low pharmacodynamic objective function values are not associated with accurate estimation of the pharmacodynamic parameters when the pharmacokinetic model is taken from other sources.
Minimization of the pharmacodynamic objective function does not select the most accurate pharmacokinetic model. Using population pharmacokinetic models from the literature instead of the 'true' pharmacokinetic model can lead to better predictions of bispectral index while incorrectly estimating the pharmacodynamic parameters.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21555936/

The aim of this study was to compare onset time, hypnosis level and the haemodynamic response after thiopental vs. propofol for induction of anaesthesia. Our primary hypothesis was that in the elderly, thiopental had a shorter onset time than propofol, defined as time to bispectral index (BIS) <50.
In this randomized and double-blinded study, we included 78 patients. Patients were eligible, if they were scheduled for elective surgery with general anaesthesia and aged 60 or older. Patients received alfentanil 10 μg/kg and either thiopental 2.5 mg/kg or propofol 1.0 mg/kg, and depth of anaesthesia was determined with BIS the following 120 s along with clinical assessment of anaesthetic depth. The primary endpoint was the time from start of injection of the hypnotic to a BIS value below 50.
Time to BIS <50 was significantly shorter in patients receiving thiopental, where onset time was 52 s (median value) compared with 65 s in the propofol group (P=0.01). Mean arterial pressure decreased 25.6 mmHg in the propofol group and 15.6 mmHg in the thiopental group (P=0.003) within 120 s.

In this randomized double-blinded study, we evaluated the effects of preoperative caudal block on sevoflurane requirements in children with cerebral palsy (CP) undergoing lower limb surgery while bispectral index (BIS) values were maintained between 45 and 55.
52 children undergoing Achilles-tendon lengthening were randomized to receive combined general-caudal anesthesia (caudal group, n = 27) or general anesthesia alone (control group, n = 25). Caudal block was performed with a single dose of 0.7 ml·kg(-1) of 1.0% lidocaine containing epinephrine at 5 μg·ml(-1). The control group received no preoperative caudal block. The endtidal sevoflurane concentrations (ET(sev)) were adjusted every minute to maintain the BIS values between 45 and 55.
The ET(sev) required to maintain the BIS values were not significantly different between the control and caudal groups after induction of anesthesia [2.1 (0.2) vs 2.2 (0.4); P = 0.773]. However, significantly higher ET(sev) was observed in the control group before surgical incision [2.0 (0.2) vs 1.8 (0.3); P = 0.013] and during the first 20 min after surgical incision [2.2 (0.3) vs 1.4 (0.3); P < 0.001]. There was no significant difference in BIS values between the control and caudal groups throughout the study period (P > 0.05). In the caudal group, the caudal block was successful in 25 of 27 (92.6%) patients.

This substudy of the B-Unaware Trial tested whether cumulative duration of BIS values lower than 45, cumulative anesthetic dose, comorbidities, or intraoperative events were independently associated with postoperative mortality.
The authors studied 1,473 patients (mean ± SD age, 57.9 ± 14.4 yr; 749 men) who underwent noncardiac surgery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to determine whether perioperative factors were independently associated with all-cause mortality.
A total of 358 patients (24.3%) died during a follow-up of 3.2 ± 1.1 yr. There were statistically significant associations among various perioperative risk factors, including malignancy and intermediate-term mortality. BIS-monitored patients did not have lower mortality than unmonitored patients (24.9 vs. 23.7%; difference = 1.2%, 95% CI, -3.3 to 5.6%). Cumulative duration of BIS values less than 45 was not associated with mortality (multivariable hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.93-1.14). Increasing mean and cumulative end-tidal anesthetic concentrations were not associated with mortality. The multivariable Cox regression model showed a good discriminative ability (c-index = 0.795).
This study found no evidence that either cumulative BIS values below a threshold of 40 or 45 or cumulative inhalational anesthetic dose is injurious to patients. These results do not support the hypothesis that limiting depth of anesthesia either by titration to a specific BIS threshold or by limiting end-tidal volatile agent concentrations will decrease postoperative mortality.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21293252/

A similar dilutional effect on accompanying volatile anesthetic agent has not been evaluated and may impact the speed of emergence.
Twenty patients undergoing surgery were randomly assigned to receive an anesthetic maintenance gas mixture of sevoflurane adjusted to bispectral index, in air-oxygen (control group) versus a 2:1 mixture of nitrous oxide-oxygen (nitrous oxide group). After surgery, baseline arterial and tidal gas samples were taken. Patients were ventilated with oxygen, and arterial and tidal gas sampling was repeated at 2 and 5 min. Arterial sampling was repeated 30 min after surgery. Sevoflurane partial pressure was measured in blood by the double headspace equilibration technique and in tidal gas using a calibrated infrared gas analyzer. Time to eye opening and time extubation were recorded. The primary endpoint was the reduction in sevoflurane partial pressures in blood at 2 and 5 min.
Relative to baseline, arterial sevoflurane partial pressure was 39% higher at 5 min in the control group (P < 0.04) versus the nitrous oxide group. At 30 min the difference was not statistically significant. Time to eye opening (8.7 vs. 10.1 min) and time to extubation (11.0 vs.13.2 min) were shorter in the nitrous oxide group versus the control group (P < 0.04).

A questionnaire survey was conducted via the Internet. The survey was designed to obtain information regarding cases involving intraoperative awareness in 2008.
A total of 172 anesthesiologists answered the survey. The total number of reported anesthetic cases was 85,156. Twenty-four cases of definite or possible awareness were reported by 21 anesthesiologists, of which 14 were cases of definite awareness and ten of possible awareness. The incidence of awareness, including possible awareness, was 0.028%. Propofol was used in 21 cases, sevoflurane in two, and a high dose of fentanyl in one. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring was used in seven cases (29%). Sixteen patients (67%) were <50 years old, six (26%) were men, and 17 (74%) were women. As the type of surgery, three cases (13%) involved gynecological surgeries and seven (30%) involved cervicofacial surgeries. During surgery, the memory at postural change was preserved in two cases.
The most surprising finding of this study is that total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) was used in 21 of the 24 (88%) cases of definite and possible awareness. Although the incidence of intraoperative awareness was compatible with the previous studies, meticulous care should be taken when anesthesia is performed by TIVA for high-risk patients. The results of this survey should be verified, as well as further continuous survey and prospective study, because this study was performed by an anonymous questionnaire survey conducted over only 1-year period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21153846/

In this study, we evaluated different combinations of propofol and remifentanil, administered through a target-controlled infusion system, to estimate the optimal concentrations as well as the best way to control the sedative effects induced by the combinations of drugs in patients undergoing ultrasonographic endoscopy.
One hundred twenty patients undergoing ultrasonographic endoscopy were randomized to receive, by means of a target-controlled infusion system, a fixed effect-site concentration of either propofol or remifentanil of 8 different possible concentrations, allowing adjustment of the concentrations of the other drug. Predicted effect-site propofol (C(e)pro) and remifentanil (C(e)remi) concentrations, parameters derived from auditory evoked potential, autoregressive auditory evoked potential index (AAI/2) and electroencephalogram (bispectral index [BIS] and index of consciousness [IoC]) signals, as well as categorical scores of sedation (Ramsay Sedation Scale [RSS] score) in the presence or absence of nociceptive stimulation, were collected, recorded, and analyzed using an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System. The models described for the relationship between C(e)pro and C(e)remi versus AAI/2, BIS, and IoC were diagnosed for inaccuracy using median absolute performance error (MDAPE) and median root mean squared error (MDRMSE), and for bias using median performance error (MDPE). The models were validated in a prospective group of 68 new patients receiving different combinations of propofol and remifentanil. The predictive ability (P(k)) of AAI/2, BIS, and IoC with respect to the sedation level, RSS score, was also explored.
Data from 110 patients were analyzed in the training group. The resulting estimated models had an MDAPE of 32.87, 12.89, and 8.77; an MDRMSE of 17.01, 12.81, and 9.40; and an MDPE of -1.86, 3.97, and 2.21 for AAI/2, BIS, and IoC, respectively, in the absence of stimulation and similar values under stimulation. P(k) values were 0.82, 0.81, and 0.85 for AAI/2, BIS, and IoC, respectively. The model predicted the prospective validation data with an MDAPE of 34.81, 14.78, and 10.25; an MDRMSE of 16.81, 15.91, and 11.81; an MDPE of -8.37, 5.65, and -1.43; and P(k) values of 0.81, 0.8, and 0.8 for AAI/2, BIS, and IoC, respectively.

Midazolam is a benzodiazepine with hypnotic action most often used as pre-anesthetic medication and its drug interactions in patients with CP are unknown. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of midazolam as pre-anesthetic drug on the BIS of patients with CP undergoing chronic treatment with anticonvulsant agents.
Three groups of patients were assessed: CP without anticonvulsant treatment, CP undergoing treatment with anticonvulsant and a group with no disease and no medication use (control group). On the day before the surgery, with the patients conscious and in dorsal decubitus, the BIS monitor was placed and the basal BIS values were recorded. On the following day, 40 minutes before the surgery, the patients received 0.6 mg*kg(-1) of midazolam orally. Before the start of the anesthetic procedure, the same procedure for BIS recording was carried out after midazolam administration.

Regarding the mean BIS value after the midazolam administration, there was no difference between patients from the CG and those in the CP group that did not take anticonvulsant drugs, whereas the ones who took anticonvulsants exhibited a difference (p = 0.003). The possibility of decrease in the BIS after midazolam use increases according to the number of anticonvulsant drugs used by the patient.

In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 40 patients (65-75 years) undergoing elective noncardiac surgery were randomly assigned to balanced anaesthesia with either 53.2 +/- 0.8% xenon (n = 19) or 1.6 +/- 0.1% sevoflurane (n = 20) in minimum 30% oxygen and remifentanil titrated to clinical needs. Depth of anaesthesia was guided by end-tidal gas concentrations and clinical signs. The attending anaesthesiologist was blinded to the BIS values, which were recorded at 1 min rates during induction, at 5 min rates during maintenance and at 20 s rates during emergence. Emergence from anaesthesia was assessed by the times to open eyes, react on demand, extubation and orientation.
During induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, BIS values in the xenon group were comparable to sevoflurane and at the lower limit of the recommended range for deep anaesthesia. Emergence to full orientation was significantly faster from xenon than from sevoflurane. BIS values were significantly lower during emergence from xenon anaesthesia.
During xenon and sevoflurane anaesthesia in the elderly, BIS-values show sufficient concordance with clinical signs of anaesthetic depth. Since during clinically guided anaesthesia values were at the lower recommended limit, additional BIS monitoring may help reduce anaesthetic consumption and costs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20671557/

Forty pediatric patients, age 6.6 +/- 3.3 years, weight 24 +/- 9 kg, scheduled for surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia were enrolled. Two minutes after i.v. injection of 0.3 mcg.kg(-1) of sufentanil, general anesthesia was induced by an initial bolus of 3 mg.kg(-1) of propofol, followed by a continuous infusion titrated to achieve a stable BIS value of 50 +/- 5. Patients received either mivacurium 0.25 mg.kg(-1) (Group Miva) or NaCl 0.9% 0.12 ml.kg(-1) (Group Control). Mean BIS and CSI values per minute were compared between (Miva vs. Control) and within groups (Baseline vs 5 min. after study drug administration).
The observed changes in BIS and CSI values before and after administration of study drugs revealed no differences between the study groups. Mean baseline BIS and CSI values were lower than 5 min after study drug administration. There were no intergroup differences with respect to BIS and CSI values at any time point.
These data suggest that in pediatric patients anesthetized with propofol, administration of mivacurium has no impact on BIS and CSI values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20670234/

30 adult, ASA physical status III and IV patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and DHCA.
There were no study-specific interventions undertaken with the study patients.
After induction of anesthesia, propofol and sufentanil were used for maintenance. Duration until BIS values reached indices of 10, 20, and 30 after DHCA was measured. DeltaBIS was defined as the difference between BIS before the start of ECC and after DHCA at the same nasopharyngeal body temperature. Data are means + or - SD (ranges).
Duration of DHCA was 24 + or - 15 min (8-71 min). The deepest nasopharyngeal temperature was 20.1 + or - 2.7 degrees C at the end of DHCA. BIS reduction was 1.8/ degrees C. At the end of DHCA, BIS was 2 + or - 6 and at the end of ECC, BIS was 33 + or - 11. Duration until BIS reached a value of 10 (BIS10) was 23 + or - 21 min (0-83 min); until BIS reached 20 (BIS20): 36 + or - 36 min (0-140 min); and until BIS reached 30 (BIS30): 43 + or - 29 min (1-130 min). Regression analysis between duration of DHCA and BIS10 was R = 0.76; BIS20: R = 0.67; and BIS30: R = 0.54.

The effectiveness of the closed-loop system to maintain BIS close to a target of 45 was determined and compared with manual administration.
After Institutional Review Board approval and written consent, 40 patients undergoing major surgery in a tertiary university hospital were allocated to two groups using computer-generated block randomization. In the Closed-loop group (n = 20), closed-loop control was used to maintain anesthesia at a target BIS of 45, and in the Control group (n = 20), propofol was administered manually to maintain the same BIS target. To evaluate each technique's performance in maintaining a steady level of hypnosis, the BIS values obtained during the surgical procedure were stratified into four clinical performance categories relative to the target BIS: < or = 10%, 11-20%, 21-30%, or > 30% defined as excellent, good, poor, or inadequate control of hypnosis, respectively. The controller performance was compared using Varvel's controller performance indices. Data were compared using Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.05 showing statistical significance.

In addition, there are certain subjective tools such as the observer's assessment of alertness and sedation which are used. The correlation between BIS and the concentration of propofol in the brain, and the relationship between these subjective and objective tools in assessing sedation levels are the subject of this study.
Thirty healthy volunteers enrolled in this prospective observational study. They were sedated with a target controlled infusion of propofol with an initial target of 0.8 microg.mL(-1)and an increase in target to 0.2 microg.mL(-1) ten minutes after equilibration of the predicted and set target concentrations. In each sedation score, the Bispectral Index value and predicted effect site concentration of propofol were recorded and analyzed. Analysis of variance and significant differences between groups were analyzed by paired t-test. Correlations between Bispectral Index and effect site concentration of propofol at each sedation score and the relationship of BIS and effect site concentration of propofol to each sedation score were assessed and analyzed by nonparametric Spearman's rho.
The means of Bispectral Index and effect site concentration of propofol at each sedation score showed a significant difference with the following score. Additionally, Bispectral Index and effect site concentration of propofol showed a significant negative correlation in sedation scores 3 and 2 when inducing sedation. In other sedation scores or when reversing the sedation, no strong correlation was noted.
Both Bispectral Index and effect site concentration of propofol indicate a good estimate of sedation levels; however their correlations are significant and negative only at moderate and deep sedation levels, and during the induction of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20187667/

Anesthetic depth monitors assist anesthesiologists in providing appropriate levels of anesthesia. Index of consciousness monitoring is a recently introduced monitor in the array of anesthesia depth monitors. The objective of this study was to assess the interchangeability of bispectral index, which is already in clinical use and the recently introduced index of consciousness techniques. The other objective was to assess this interchangeability during normotension, hypotension and during pulseless state in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. This study is a prospective observational study, conducted in a tertiary referral hospital.
Fifteen cardiac surgical patients undergoing off pump and conventional coronary artery bypass under cardiopulmonary bypass participated in the study. Bispectral index and index of consciousness monitoring were carried out simultaneously during various stages of consciousness, and assessed for interchangeability. Bland Altman plotting and 'mountain plot' were used to assess the interchangeability. Eleven in the cohort underwent off pump and the rest (n = 4) conventional coronary artery bypass surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass. A set of 887 data were obtained during the study period. The data were classified as those obtained during normotension, hypotension and pulseless state during cardiopulmonary bypass.
732 sets of data were obtained during normotension, 84 during hypotension and 71 during cardiopulmonary bypass. Overall interchangeability was good, suggested by low bias (0.96), high precision (0.54), r value of 0.7 and P value of <0.0001. It was found that the data obtained during normotension was also interchangeable, suggested by low bias (0.8), high precision (0.54) and r value of 0.7. The data obtained during hypotension was not as highly interchangeable as during normotension-bias 0.4, precision 1.66 and r value of 0.7. The analysis of value during cardiopulmonary bypass suggested non interchangeability (bias 3.87, precision 3.05, r value 0.3 and P value = 0.0067.

Thirty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery receiving remifentanil-propofol anesthesia.
Surgery was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cardiac arrest in 15 patients, with CPB without cardiac arrest in 9 patients and without CPB in 6 patients.
RE, SE, BIS, burst suppression ratio (BSR), and frontal electromyography (f-EMG) were detected simultaneously. RE and SE compared favorably with BIS and their correlations were strong (r(2) = 0.6, r(2) = 0.55, respectively). The mean bias of RE and BIS was -1.8, but limits of agreement were high (+20.5/-24.1). RE and SE tended to be lower than the BIS values in the CPB subgroups. The detection of BSR was similar with RE and SE and the BIS. A strong correlation existed between BIS and f-EMG (r(2) = 0.62) in contrast to RE (r(2) = 0.45) and SE (r(2) =0.39). BIS monitoring was significantly more disturbed than RE and SE with 9.1% +/-10.9% and 0.1% +/- 0.2% of the total anesthesia time, respectively. Neither implicit nor explicit memory was shown.
RE and SE are comparable with the BIS but showed significantly less interference from f-EMG and superior resistance against artifacts. Thus, spectral entropy is more suitable than the BIS during propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in cardiac surgery patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19945300/

Our objective was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of BIS changes during carotid clamping in relation to shunted patients in awake CEA.
Eighty CEAs under cervical block were included. There were two patient groups: with clinical signs of cerebral ischemia (shunted patients) and without signs of cerebral ischemia (nonshunted patients). Data were based on bispectral index (BIS) values and neurological monitoring at different surgery time points, with special attention paid during carotid clamping. BIS values were compared between shunted and nonshunted patients. Sensitivity and specificity, along with positive and negative predictive values of a percentage BIS value decrease during carotid clamping from baseline BIS values, were calculated in both patient groups.
Shunting was performed in 11 patients with cerebral ischemia at carotid clamping. Mean BIS values were 82.82+/-11.98 in shunted patients and 92.31+/-5.42 in nonshunted patients at carotid clamping (p<0.001). Relative decreased BIS values in relation to basal BIS values were 13.57% in shunted patients and 3.68% in nonshunted patients (p<0.05). The percentage decrease in BIS was 14%, sensitivity was 81.8% (95% CI 49.9-96.8), and specificity was 89.7% (95% CI 79.3-95.4).
BIS monitoring during carotid clamping is an easy, noninvasive method which correlates with cerebral ischemia in patients undergoing CEA.

Depth of hypnosis was monitored using the bispectral index. Blood samples were collected from the induction of anesthesia up to 12 hours after the end of propofol infusion, at predetermined intervals. Plasma propofol concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by a non-compartmental propofol pharmacokinetic analysis. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, considering p<0.05 as significant.
After cardiopulmonary bypass, despite similar plasma propofol concentrations in both groups, bispectral index values were lower in the on-pump coronary artery bypass graft group.

Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass had shorter biological (1.82 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.67 +/- 1.15 h, p < 0.01) and terminal elimination (6.27 +/- 1.29 vs. 10.5h +/- 2.18, p < 0.01) half-life values, as well as higher total plasma clearance (28.36 +/- 11.40 vs.18.29 +/- 7.67 mL/kg/min, p = 0.03), compared to patients in the off-pump coronary artery bypass graft group.
Aside from the increased sensitivity of the brain to anesthetics after cardiopulmonary bypass, changes in propofol pharmacokinetics may contribute to its central nervous system effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19330248/
19143957,Depth of sedation using Cerebral State Index in infants undergoing spinal anesthesia.,Paediatric anaesthesia,2009,"Disma N, Tuo P, Astuto M, Davidson AJ","Infants are noted to frequently sleep during spinal anesthesia, with a concomitant fall in Bispectral Index. However, there are suggestions that EEG derived anesthesia depth monitors have inferior performance in infants. The aim of this study was to quantify the degree of sedation during spinal anesthesia in infants using another EEG derived measure of anesthesia effect--the Cerebral State Index (CSI).
Twelve infants, <52 weeks postconceptual menstrual age, scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair under spinal anesthesia were enrolled. Patients received a standard anesthetic protocol with a subarachnoid dose of 1 mg x kg(-1) of levobupivacaine 0.5%. No premedication, sedatives, opioids or anticholinergics were administrated during the perioperative period and patients were left undisturbed during the surgical time, without tactile stimulation or loud auditory stimuli. CSI score (0-100) and bust suppression (BS) (0-100%) were continuously recorded during the surgical time and then statistically re-evaluated.
In all patients the CSI fell during the procedure and there were significant levels of BS recorded by the CSI monitor. The BS occurred between 12 and 34 min after spinal anesthesia with the peak being at 30 min and mean onset time being 15 (2.6) min after spinal block. A statistical significant difference was found between the lowest mean CSI as well as the highest BS if compared with their baseline values. A negative correlation was found between CSI and BS.
The degree of burst suppression detected by the CSI in our study supports the hypothesis that infants may have discontinuous patterns of EEG during spinal anesthesia similar to those seen during emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, the limitations in the application of the adult algorithms to infant EEG may lead to an overestimation of the degree of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19143957/

Previous studies in children have suggested BIS performs well in older children, however these studies have used earlier versions of the BIS device. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of BIS over different age groups using the BIS paediatric Quattro sensor (Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA, U.S.A.). One hundred and eighty children between one and 13 years were enrolled. At a predetermined time during emergence from anaesthesia, wakefulness was assessed and BIS recorded. For analysis, children were divided into four groups (one to three, three to six, six to nine and nine to 13 years) and for each age group a receiver operating characteristic curve was generated. Areas under the curve were compared across age groups. Good quality BIS data was available in 161 children. The areas under the curves for each age group were: one to three years 0.80, three to six years 0.88, six to nine years 0.85 and nine to 13 years 0.95. Although the area was least in the youngest age group and greatest in the oldest age group, there was no evidence for a difference when tested with ANOVA (P=0.26). When combining all age groups taking a BIS value of 50 or greater provided 100% sensitivity to detect wakefulness. This study found no evidence for any substantial difference in performance between ages one and 13 years. If BIS is used in children to detect wakefulness occurring with lightening of anaesthesia, then this study suggests that if the BIS is maintained below 50 then wakefulness is unlikely to have occurred.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19115649/

As in recent studies attempting to correlate frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements with clinical evaluations of sedative efficacy, there is considerable overlap in numerical EEG values and different clinical levels of sedation. This precludes the use of these monitors for monitoring or titrating sedation in the critically ill. Despite many attempts, no study has yet presented data showing improved outcome with the use of EEG monitors in ICU sedation. Meanwhile, clinical sedation protocols have emerged, improving important endpoints in critically ill patients needing sedation. A major underlying problem in applying EEG monitors in the ICU is that they have been developed for measuring anesthetic depth and the related risk of recall, rather than the acknowledged endpoints of sedation, namely reduction of anxiety and discomfort. Until an 'objective' monitor is developed to measure the degree of such symptoms, physicians should continue treating patients and not numbers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18983711/

We sought to quantify and compare the dynamic profile of sevoflurane's effect measured with the cerebral state index (CSI) and the bispectral index (BIS) in children.
Fifteen healthy children, aged 3-15 yr, scheduled to undergo minor surgery were prospectively studied. During the simultaneous recording of CSI and BIS, the sevoflurane vaporizer was set at 6 vol % for 5 min and then decreased. End-tidal concentrations (C(ET)) were measured. The C(ET)-sevoflurane effect-site concentration equilibration and pharmacodynamics were modeled. Goodness of fit between models was compared. Data are typical value (coefficient of variation).
Within the anesthetic depth range studied, the rate of change of sevoflurane's effect expressed as the effect-site equilibration half-life (t(1/2) k(e0)) was slower with the CSI [2.0 (14) min] than with BIS [1.2 (53) min] (P < 0.05). The estimated baseline effect of BIS and CSI before sevoflurane administration (E(0)) was 84 (39) for CSI and 87 (7) for BIS (NS). The sensitivity to sevoflurane hypnotic effect expressed in the C(50) [steady-state C(ET) eliciting half of the maximum response (E(max))] was 2.1 (68) % with CSI and 2.1 (16)% with BIS (NS). The E(max) with CSI 45 (0) was higher than that with BIS 27 (39) (P < 0.05). The population prediction error was significantly better for BIS (-0.7 +/- 26.9) than for CSI (-3.0 +/- 178.6) (P < 0.05).
In children, the t(1/2) k(e0) of sevoflurane and the pharmacodynamics of sevoflurane were quantified and the results were entirely dependent on the monitor used to measure its hypnotic effect. Within the anesthetic depth range studied, the rate of change of sevoflurane's effect was slower with the CSI.

The objective of the present study was to observe correlation between an established subjective measure, the Ramsay Sedation Scale, and two objective tools for monitoring critically ill patients: the Bispectral Index (BIS) and auditory evoked potential. Ninety patients undergoing major surgery scheduled for postoperative mechanical ventilation and continuous sedation with propofol and fentanyl were selected. Electrodes for determining BIS and auditory evoked potential were placed on the foreheads of all patients according to manufacturer's specifications at least six hours after patients' arrival at the intensive care unit. Ramsay Sedation Scale, BIS, signal quality index, composite A-line autoregressive index (AAI) and electromyographic activities were recorded every five minutes for 30 minutes. BIS and AAI showed good correlation amongst readings (r(s)=0.697, P <0.01). Both were significantly influenced by electromyographic activities (BIS, r(s)=0.735, P <0.01; AAI, r(s)=0.856, P <0.01). Comparison of BIS and AAI revealed an acceptable correlation between electroencephalogram variables and the Ramsay Sedation Scale (BIS, tau=-0.689; AAI, tau=-0.621; P <0.01). In conclusion, the auditory evoked potential and BIS monitors revealed an acceptable correlation with the Ramsay Sedation Scale. However, the BIS and auditory evoked potential monitors do not perform adequately as a substitute in the assessment of sedated intensive care unit patients. These monitors could be used as part of an integrated approach for the evaluation of those patients especially when the subjective scales do not work well in the setting of neuromuscular blockade or may not be sufficiently sensitive to evaluate very deep sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18714625/

In this study, I examined the effects, of AEP click sounds on the BIS, and also on the response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE) of the entropy monitor.
Forty patients aged 40-70 yr and scheduled for surgery of lower extremities under spinal anesthesia were anesthetized with 0.5% bupivacaine or tetracaine. Patients were sedated with midazolam 1 mg followed by propofol infusion started at 1 mg.kg(-1).h(-1). Propofol infusion was controlled to keep BIS or SE at 80, 60, or 40 for several minutes, and then click sounds (65 dB) of the AEP were given for 60 s. The changes in BIS, RE, and SE were observed continuously for 60 s after the click sounds had stopped.
BIS, SE, and RE significantly increased during the click sounds. The longest duration of increase was at BIS or SE 60.
AEP monitor click sounds transiently increased the simultaneously measured BIS, RE, and SE during different levels of sedation by propofol infusion during spinal anesthesia.

After mask induction with xenon and intubation, anesthesia was continued with xenon only. BIS, State Entropy and Response Entropy, and electroencephalogram were monitored throughout induction, steady-state anesthesia, and emergence. The performance of BIS, State Entropy, and Response Entropy were evaluated with prediction probability, sensitivity, and specificity analyses. The power spectrum of the raw electroencephalogram signal was calculated.
The mean (SD) xenon concentration during anesthesia was 66.4% (2.4%). BIS, State Entropy, and Response Entropy demonstrated low prediction probability values at loss of response (0.455, 0.656, and 0.619) but 1 min after that the values were high (0.804, 0.941, and 0.929). Thereafter, equally good performance was demonstrated for all indices. At emergence, the prediction probability values to distinguish between steady-state anesthesia and return of response for BIS, State Entropy, and Response Entropy were 0.988, 0.892, and 0.992. No statistical differences between the performances of the monitors were observed. Quantitative electroencephalogram analyses showed generalized increase in total power (P < 0.001), delta (P < 0.001) and theta activity (P < 0.001), and increased alpha activity (P = 0.003) in the frontal brain regions.
Electroencephalogram-derived depth of sedation indices BIS and Entropy showed a delay to detect loss of response during induction of xenon anesthesia.

A properly trained anaesthetist, administering anaesthesia according to their knowledge of pharmacology and patient and surgical characteristics, assisted by clinical signs and monitoring, can minimize this risk. Relying upon volatile-based anaesthesia delivered at a concentration of at least 0.5 MAC may be effective, but this precludes the use of total intravenous anaesthesia techniques and in any case may lead to unwanted hypotension. Equipment failure may occur. Benzodiazepines do not protect the patient from awareness. The development of electroencephalographic monitors of anaesthetic depth provides an opportunity to prevent awareness.

Perceived risk factors, use of awareness monitors, pre- and postoperative discussions of awareness as well as personal experience were enquired.
A total of 302 (51%) responded to the email survey. More than 60% indicated that awareness is a problem in pediatric anesthesia with the majority estimating an incidence of 1 : 1000.

The nurses had at least 10 months of experience in conducting anaesthesia and all had a theoretical introduction and a test session to become familiar with the equipment. The sequence was randomized and the observer was blinded to whether a monitor was used. Fifty patients were anaesthetized with propofol and fentanyl. Recovery time, consumption of anaesthetic drugs, and patient satisfaction were measured in both groups.
Recovery time was 11 minutes in the monitor group (range: 2-53 minutes) and 15 minutes in the control group, (range: 3-60 minutes). P = 0.26. There were no statistically significant differences in consumption of anaesthetic drugs or patient satisfaction in the two groups.

The median pre-awakening values for entropy and BIS varied significantly across ages with the values being lowest in the 0-1 yr age group (response entropy: 45 vs 84, 87 and 89, P=0.003; state entropy: 36 vs 78, 74 and 77, P=0.009; BIS: 56 vs 78, 76.5 and 72, P=0.02). Values were recorded at all three sevoflurane concentrations in 48 children. Compared with older groups, the 0-1 yr age group had the least significant difference in BIS and entropy when compared among different sevoflurane concentrations. The calculated sevoflurane concentrations to achieve mid-scale values of entropy and BIS were highest in the 1-2 yr age group, lower in the 0-1 yr age group and progressively lower in the 2-4 and 4-12 yr age groups.
For both entropy and BIS the measure of anaesthetic effect was significantly different for children aged <1 yr compared with older children. There was no difference in performance of entropy and BIS. Both should be used cautiously in small children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16183678/
16119484,Recovery from bispectral index-guided anaesthesia in a large randomized controlled trial of patients at high risk of awareness.,Anaesthesia and intensive care,2005,"Leslie K, Myles PS, Forbes A, Chan MT, Short TG, Swallow SK","Electroencephalographic monitors of anaesthetic depth are reported to assist anaesthetists in reducing recovery times. We explored the effect of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring on recovery times in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 2,463 patients at high risk of awareness. Patients were randomized to BIS-guided anaesthesia or routine care. In the BIS group, anaesthesia was adjusted to maintain a BIS value of 40-60 from the commencement of laryngoscopy to the start of wound closure, and 55-70 during wound closure. In the routine care group, anaesthesia was adjusted according to traditional clinical signs. In multivariate models, BIS monitoring, female gender, lower American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status and shorter duration of anaesthesia predicted faster time to eye-opening after anaesthesia, and faster time to post-anaesthesia care unit discharge. BIS monitoring did not affect times to tracheal extubation among patients admitted to the intensive care unit. We conclude that BIS monitoring has statistically significant, but clinically modest, effects on recovery times in high risk surgical patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16119484/
15693977,The use of bispectral index monitors in paediatric intensive care.,"Critical care (London, England)",2005,Playfor SD,The bispectral index (BIS) is a processed neurophysiological electroencephalographic parameter that may be used to evaluate the depth of sedation in critically ill children. Triltsch and colleagues attempted to correlate BIS scores with a commonly used clinical sedation scoring system. They were able to demonstrate good correlation during deep sedation and in cases where the electrical impedance of the BIS electrodes was lowest. Studies have shown only moderate degrees of correlation between BIS scores and clinical sedation scoring systems. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend routine monitoring of BIS scores in critically ill children.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15693977/

This randomised study compares three different depth-of-anaesthesia monitors during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at 34 degrees C with fentanyl/propofol anaesthesia adjusted clinically and blinded to the monitors. Coronary artery bypass grafting patients (n = 21) were randomly assigned to all three possible paired combinations of three monitors: Bispectral Index (Aspect Medical), AAI auditory evoked potential (Danmeter), Entropy (Datex-Ohmeda). Indices were manually recorded every 5 min during CPB. Agreement between paired indices was classified as good, non-, or disagreement. Anaesthesia was classed as adequate, inadequate, or excessive according to recommended index values. Of the 255 paired indices recorded, 62% showed good agreement, 33% showed non-agreement, and 5% showed disagreement. Using good agreement between two monitors as a gold standard, a quarter of the measurements indicate inappropriate anaesthetic depth monitoring during CPB with clinically titrated anaesthetic depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15644019/
15564934,Comparative evaluation of the Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Entropy Module and the Bispectral Index monitor during propofol-remifentanil anesthesia.,Anesthesiology,2004,"Schmidt GN, Bischoff P, Standl T, Hellstern A, Teuber O, Schulte Esch J","Different analytical concepts were introduced to quantify the changes of the electroencephalogram. The Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Entropy Module (Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium Corp., Helsinki, Finland) was the first commercial monitor based on the entropy generating two indices, the state entropy (SE) and the response entropy (RE). The aim of the current study was to compare the accuracy of SE and RE with the Bispectral Index(R) monitor (BIS(R); Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) during propofol-remifentanil anesthesia.
The authors investigated 20 female patients during minor gynecologic surgery. SE, RE, BIS, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and sedation level were recorded every 20 s during stepwise increase (target-controlled infusion, 0.5 microg/ml) of propofol until the patients lost response. Five minutes after loss of response, remifentanil infusion (0.4 microg . kg(-1) . min(-1)) was started. Spearman correlation coefficient and prediction probability were calculated for sedation levels with SE, RE, BIS, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate. The ability of the investigated parameters to distinguish between the anesthesia steps awake versus loss of response, awake versus anesthesia, anesthesia versus first reaction, and anesthesia versus extubation was analyzed with the prediction probability.
SE correlates best with sedation levels, but no significant differences of the prediction probability values among SE, RE, and BIS were found. The prediction probability for all investigated steps of anesthesia did not show significant differences among SE, RE, and BIS. SE, RE, and BIS were superior to mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate.
SE, RE, and BIS revealed similar information about the level of sedation and allowed the authors to distinguish between different steps of anesthesia. Both monitors provided useful additional information for the anesthesiologist.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15564934/

Having minute-to-minute indicators and reassurance of adequate sedation in the neuromuscular-blockaded patient enables neuroscience nurses to provide better care. More timely and current measurements of pentobarbital serum levels can help reduce and prevent life-threatening complications in this patient population.

14693602,"Alaris AEP monitor's ""Click Detection"" does not help to detect inadvertent disconnection of headphones during anesthesia.",Anesthesia and analgesia,2004,"Schmidt GN, Bischoff P, Standl T, Gerhardt A, Lankenau G, Am Esch JS","Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) can be suppressed by anesthetics dose dependently, but may fail to be registered because of the absence of adequate auditory stimuli. The Alaris AEP monitor includes the ""Click Detection"" (CD) (generating the message ""NO AEP"" or ""LOW AEP"") to detect the loss of auditory stimuli. We investigated the accuracy of the CD in 17 patients awake (AWAKE) and during anesthesia (ANESTHESIA) with accurately placed headphones (HP) and after disconnected HP (No HP) over 5 min each, respectively. Alaris AEP ARX index, CD, and Bispectral Index were recorded each minute. Changes were evaluated with the Friedman and Wilcoxon test. Sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) and receiver operating characteristic curve were analyzed for the accuracy of the CD. During AWAKE after disconnection of the HP, Alaris AEP ARX index decreased significantly (P < 0.05). The CD was able to detect No HP after 2 min with a SEN of 88% and a SPE of 97%. During ANESTHESIA, no changes were found after HP disconnection. CD detected No HP with a SEN of 100% and a SPE of 20%. The CD of the Alaris AEP monitor is not able to detect unnoticed disconnection of HP during ANESTHESIA.
Signal transmission of auditory evoked potentials can be suppressed by anesthetics, but also by disconnection of headphones. In the present study, we demonstrate that even the Alaris AEP monitor with the very new feature ""Click Detection"" was not able to detect the loss of headphones during general anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14693602/

We included 15 ASA I patients scheduled for general anaesthesia. Induction was performed by infusion of propofol at 100 ml.h-1 until loss of consciousness. Both BIS and AAI monitors responded appropriately at that time. The calculated effect site concentration of propofol at loss of consciousness was maintained by means of a computer controlled infusion system. A 'pseudo' steady-state effect site concentration was reached after 4 min. After 1 min of baseline measurements, ketamine was administered. BIS values increased from the 3rd to the 8th min after the administration of ketamine. The AAI showed no significant increase or decrease, but between-patient variability increased.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12969037/
12771672,Monitoring during cardiac arrest: are we there yet?,Current opinion in critical care,2003,"Hayes MM, Berg RA, Otto CW","Advancements in electronic data acquisition have translated into improved monitoring of victims of cardiac arrest, but initial techniques remain direct observation of pulses and respirations. The most essential monitor continues to be the electrocardiogram. However, monitoring diastolic blood pressure, myocardial perfusion pressure, and end-tidal carbon dioxide are extremely useful. Most of the current research on monitoring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation focuses on methods for analyzing ventricular fibrillation waveforms. By analyzing the waveform, defibrillation shocks may be delivered at the time when the chance of success is optimal. Low-amplitude and low-frequency fibrillation waveforms are associated with increased rates of asystole and pulseless electrical activity after defibrillation. Methods of analyzing the ventricular fibrillation waveform include measuring the amplitude and frequency and combining the contributions of amplitude and frequency by various methods to improve discrimination. Other types of monitoring being studied for their usefulness during cardiac arrests include sonography, Bispectral Index monitoring, tissue carbon dioxide monitors, and pupil observation. The test of these monitoring techniques is ultimately their ability to improve patient survival to hospital discharge, which is a major challenge for resuscitation researchers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12771672/

None of the present monitors is both simple to use and accurate. Ocular microtremor (OMT) is a physiological tremor that is suppressed by propofol in a dose-dependent manner. We studied OMT during propofol induction and nitrous oxide-oxygen-sevoflurane maintenance of anaesthesia in 30 patients, and compared OMT with the bispectral index (BIS) as a predictor of response to verbal command.
OMT was measured using the closed-eye piezoelectric strain-gauge technique. OMT and BIS were measured at specific times during the anaesthetic, including at loss of consciousness, at end-tidal sevoflurane 1 and 2%, and at emergence.
OMT decreased significantly after induction, did not decrease as end-tidal sevoflurane was increased from 1 to 2%, and increased at emergence in all patients. By logistic regression, OMT was more sensitive and specific than BIS in distinguishing the awake from the anaesthetized state (OMT, 84.9 and 93.1% respectively; BIS, 75.7 and 69.0%).
OMT is suppressed by sevoflurane and accurately predicts response to verbal command. OMT may be a useful monitor of depth of hypnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12393354/
11837151,The BIS monitor: a review and technology assessment.,AANA journal,2001,Bard JW,"In the administration of anesthesia, clinicians have traditionally relied on a variety of autonomic signs to assess the pharmacologic effects of anesthetic agents on the central nervous system. As any experienced clinician knows, these signs can be misleading and lead to overdosing or underdosing of anesthetic drugs. The development of a monitor to measure the bispectral index (BIS) provides anesthetists with the first clinically tested and US Food and Drug Administration-approved monitor to assess the effects of anesthesia on the cerebral cortex. This article reviews the development of the BIS monitor, compares the BIS monitor with other commonly used clinical monitors, assesses the cost-benefit from the use of this monitor, and explores some of the possible uses for this monitor outside of the operating suite.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11837151/
11531678,A study of bispectral analysis and auditory evoked potential indices during propofol-induced hypnosis in volunteers: the effect of an episode of wakefulness on explicit and implicit memory.,Anaesthesia,2001,"Barr G, Anderson RE, Jakobsson JG","The bispectral index (BIS) and the auditory evoked potential (AEP) index as calculated by the new A-line monitor were measured during hypnosis with propofol, which included an episode of wakefulness. Both indices followed a similar pattern during sedation, with values decreasing with sedation and increasing when awake. Baseline AEP values varied between 60 and 98, and BIS values were between 96 and 98. The AEP-index value was at all times 10-20 points lower than the BIS-index. The transition to loss of response occurred at a mean AEP value of 46 and BIS value of 58. The transition to just responding following a period of unconsciousness occurred at a mean AEP value of 46 and BIS 65. Both monitoring techniques, however, displayed large interindividual variations making it impossible to discriminate in real time between subtle changes of clinical state. The new neurophysiological monitors A-line AEP and BIS are interesting tools for creating a better understanding of the anaesthetic effects of drugs; however, further refinements are required before their relative roles can be fully established in the clinical setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11531678/
11065209,Are electrocardiogram electrodes acceptable for electroencephalogram bispectral index monitoring?,Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,2000,"Seitsonen E, Yli-Hankala A, Korttila K","The monitoring of electroencephalogram bispectral index (EEG-BIS) during anaesthesia reduces anaesthetic use and improves recovery. However, it also increases the direct costs of anaesthesia due to the need for special EEG electrodes. In the present study we tested the feasibility of less expensive electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes for EEG-BIS monitoring.
In the first part of the study we compared skin-electrode impedances when EEG electrodes were used after alcohol swab pretreatment of skin to impedances when ECG electrodes were used after alcohol swab pretreatment with or without skin abrasion paste. In the second part of the study we evaluated the difference in parallel BIS values collected with two BIS monitors, using either ECG electrodes or EEG electrodes. In the third part of the study we compared parallel BIS values collected with two sets of EEG electrodes.
Skin pretreatment with abrasion paste led to lower impedances with ECG electrodes than did alcohol swab pretreatment of skin with EEG electrodes. When the skin was pretreated with alcohol swab, higher impedances were measured with ECG electrodes than with EEG electrodes. In most patients, BIS values collected with ECG electrodes were also higher than those collected with adhesive EEG electrodes. The difference between parallel BIS values collected with two sets of adhesive EEG electrodes was smaller than the difference between BIS values collected with ECG and EEG electrode sets.
Low skin-electrode impedances indicating reliable skin-electrode contact can be ensured with inexpensive pregelled ECG electrodes only if the skin is carefully prepared with both abrasion paste and alcohol. When only alcohol pretreatment of skin is used, the BIS values collected with EEG electrodes and ECG electrodes are not equal. EEG-BIS monitoring with pregelled ECG electrodes is recommended only if skin is prepared with abrasion paste before attaching the electrodes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11065209/
