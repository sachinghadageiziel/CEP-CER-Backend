41409261,Effects of Subanesthetic Esketamine on Postoperative Sleep Quality Through EEG Analysis in Breast Cancer Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Drug design, development and therapy",2025,"Zhan Y, Zhang Y, Liu Z, Yin Z, Wang D, Xie X, Wang L","Postoperative sleep disturbance (POSD) is prevalent following breast cancer surgery, impairing postoperative recovery. However, effective interventions and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to evaluate whether intravenous subanesthetic esketamine improves postoperative sleep quality and its association with electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency band changes in breast cancer patients.
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients undergoing breast cancer surgery received either intravenous esketamine (0.2 mg/kg induction, 0.4 mg/kg/h maintenance) or placebo during anesthesia. Both groups received intraoperative EEG monitoring. The primary outcome was POSD incidence at 24 hours assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary outcomes included PSQI scores at 72 hours, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores, and intraoperative EEG parameters.
POSD incidence was significantly reduced in the esketamine group compared with the control group (27.3% [16/58] vs 51.7% [30/58]; odds ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16-0.77; P = 0.014). Moreover, the esketamine group demonstrated significantly lower PSQI scores at both 24 hours (median [IQR], 2 [1-5] vs 4 [4-8]; P < 0.001) and 72 hours (1 [0-2.5] vs 3.5 [2.75-5]; P < 0.001). The esketamine group exhibited significantly higher intraoperative gamma-band relative power spectral density (mean [SD], 0.74 [0.25] vs 0.52 [0.18]; P < 0.001), which was independently associated with reduced POSD risk in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-0.97; P = 0.039).
Subanesthetic esketamine significantly reduced the incidence of POSD and lowered PSQI scores. Importantly, esketamine was associated with enhanced intraoperative gamma-band EEG activity, which was independently associated with reduced POSD risk, suggesting that modulation of specific cortical oscillations may underlie its sleep-enhancing effects.

41382202,A methodological guideline for consciousness assessment via neural electrophysiological activity.,Military Medical Research,2025,"Ping AA, Guan LZ, Wang Y, Yang S, Yang C, Hu XQ, Tu YH, Chen H, Li WG, Li XL","Physiological, pharmacological, and pathological alterations of consciousness provide critical windows into its neural substrates. Given the inherent complexity and multidimensionality of consciousness, defining quantitative, dynamic signatures of neural activity, and translating them into clinically applicable tools remains challenge. This study aimed to build an electroencephalography (EEG)-based methodological guideline for clinical consciousness assessment.
EEG signals were systematically categorized across periodic and aperiodic activity, connectivity and network topology, spatiotemporal dynamics, self-organized criticality, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked responses. These biomarkers were mapped onto a conceptual framework of consciousness, comprising wakefulness and internal/external awareness, based on their validation across clinical conditions. The discriminative efficacy of various biomarkers was then evaluated across 4 independent datasets.
Integrated EEG features each captured distinct yet complementary dimensions of consciousness, supporting a unified neurophysiological architecture underlying diverse alterations of consciousness. Spectral power and peak frequency tracked the loss of consciousness during propofol anesthesia and sleep. Steeper aperiodic slopes, loss of frontoparietal connectivity, disrupted small-world organization, and reduced effective dimensionality were particularly effective in distinguishing minimally conscious state (MCS) from unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS). Additionally, spatiotemporal patterns exhibited consciousness-specific alterations, with both pharmacological and pathological alterations influencing specific microstate dynamics.
Synthesizing integrated neural dynamics and multidimensional consciousness, this guideline establishes both methodological and theoretical foundations for translating neurophysiological biomarkers into clinical applications. While this work advances both conceptual clarity and practical methodology, large-scale validation across expanded clinical cohorts, experimental models, and multimodal platforms is essential to fully establish causal linkages and translational utility.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41382202/

We investigated cortical dynamics during attention and working memory tasks before and after self-paced chewing. Thirty healthy adults performed a visuospatial two-back task (2-Back) and visual oddball task (VO) under a 2x2 factorial design: chewing (one minute prior to the tasks) vs. no-chewing and with vs. without local anesthesia. Chewing improved behavioral measures in the 2-Back and the VO tasks. Frontocentral theta power and coherence increased post-chewing in both tasks, indicating enhanced neural synchronization. Theta frequency correlated with chewing frequency in the 2-Back test only, and early sensory P1-N1 complex of the ERP was increased post-chewing, indicating that chewing entrains and modulates task-specific theta activity and functional connectivity, possibly via a Locus Coeruleus - Thalamic - Cortical loop, tuning cognitive processing. These findings underscore the potential of masticatory activity in supporting cognitive health and suggest implications for populations with compromised oral function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41381640/

Most automated approaches rely on frequency-domain analysis and deep neural networks-requiring substantial preprocessing and computation, which limits their suitability for real-time deployment in hardware-constrained ICU environments. This paper presents SleepISI, a neuromorphic, preprocessing-free, time-domain framework for sleep staging using single-channel (C4-A1) raw EEG signals. The signal is encoded into spike trains via a low-power Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) neuron model, where inter-spike intervals (ISIs) are inversely proportional to signal amplitude. Ten ISI-based features-mean, median, Q1, Q3, IQR, ZCR, CSDM $_{\delta _{\rm mean}}$ and CSDM$_{\text{activity}}$, CSDM$_{\text{mobility}}$, CSDM$_{\text{complexity}}$ - are extracted over fixed 10 s windows and 30 s values were evaluated by aggregating three successive 10 s values. Feature relevance is verified via the Kruskal-Wallis test and classification is performed through a four-level hierarchical Random Forest model to differentiate Wake, REM and Non-REM stages (S1, S2, SWS). The proposed system achieves 86.23% accuracy on the CAP database, 82.13% on the SleepEDF-20 database, and 91.87% on the ISRUC-S3 database using a single EEG channel and no preprocessing. FPGA/45-nm ASIC prototypes confirm real-time feasibility at 70.77 $\mu$W. SleepISI offers a compact, interpretable, and energy-efficient solution for continuous EEG-based sleep monitoring in ICUs and resource-constrained healthcare settings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41359705/
41359022,Effect of processed electroencephalography-guided anesthesia on postoperative delirium: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,"International journal of surgery (London, England)",2025,"Cao L, Chen Q, Xiang Y, Wu Z, Zeng Z, Chen F, Yang M, Yang G, Li H","Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication following surgery, associated with extended hospital stays, cognitive decline, and increased mortality, yet effective pharmacological prevention remains elusive. Processed electroencephalography (p-EEG) guided general anesthesia is designed to reduce excessive neural suppression linked to POD development. However, conflicting evidence exists due to variations in devices and regional practices.
We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to January 2025, randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing p-EEG guided general anesthesia with standard care in adult surgical patients. Statistical analysis employed random-effects models calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was POD incidence.
Twelve RCTs involving 4523 surgical patients were included. p-EEG guided general anesthesia reduced the incidence of POD compared with control group (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.95, I2 = 46%), with pronounced benefits in elderly patients (≥60 years, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-0.99) and non-cardiac surgeries (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.95). Regional heterogeneity was significant: European and East Asian/Australasian trials demonstrated efficacy, whereas North American studies showed no benefit. In addition, p-EEG guided general anesthesia reduced postoperative cognitive dysfunction (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.89), shortened hospital stays (MD -0.90 days, 95% CI -1.60 to -0.20), and lowered vasopressor requirements (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64-0.83). Mortality did not differ between groups.
p-EEG guided general anesthesia demonstrates reduces POD incidence and associated complications, especially in elderly patients and non-cardiac surgeries. However, the effectiveness may vary due to differences in practice, anesthetic protocols, and cultural factors. Our findings support the implementation of tailored neuromonitoring in high-risk populations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41359022/

Assessing the effect of these changes is very important for optimizing EEG-guided anesthesia in the chemotherapy-exposed subpopulation.In this work, the effects of chemotherapy on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during general anesthesia (GA) were studied. A total of 31 patients were enrolled in the study: 15 with a history of chemotherapy and 16 controls. Their EEG signals were recorded during GA. Patients with prior chemotherapy exposure exhibited significantly lower EEG power in the alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-25 Hz) and gamma (25-40 Hz) frequency bands compared to the control group. These findings suggest that chemotherapy-exposed patients may require tailored anesthetic strategies to improve outcomes. This work highlights the need for additional research focused on studying the efficacy of standard EEG-guided anesthesia protocols for patients suffering from ""chemobrain"" and evaluating the need for treatment personalization.Clinical relevance- EEG-guided anesthesia relies on EEG frequency band powers. The reduced power in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands observed among chemotherapy-exposed patients suggests the need for personalized anesthetic management to prevent excessive doses and related complications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41337162/

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,2025,"Orguc S, Breault MS, Kang GH, Aregawi M, Horvath R, Henry M, Brown EN","Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for individuals with treatment-resistant depression. It involves applying external electrical stimulation to the brain in patients under general anesthesia to induce ictal activity followed by postictal activity which are observable on an electroencephalogram (EEG). Many factors influence the overall therapeutic outcome of ECT. In this paper, we use patient and treatment information along with EEG data from six patients undergoing ECT to explore the impact that these factors have on patient outcomes. We observed distinct spectral differences in the EEG across four distinctly defined phases of the treatment: baseline, pre-ECT, ECT, and post-ECT. Based on these insights, we developed two regression models to predict ictal and postictal durations as outputs that are proxies for patient outcomes. These models incorporate patient and treatment features alongside EEG spectral data to estimate target outputs. Our exploratory analysis highlights ECT-related features that may influence both immediate and long-term treatment outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41336760/
41327037,The impact of intraoperative esketamine infusion on postoperative sleep in patients undergoing general surgery.,BMC anesthesiology,2025,"Zhang M, Wang Z, Cheng H, Gao D, Cui L, Zhang J, Zhang R, Xu J, Ji Q","Major abdominal surgery frequently induces circadian sleep-wake disturbances, characterized by increased daytime rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and prolonged nocturnal wakefulness. This study investigated the effects of perioperative continuous esketamine infusion (0.3 mg/kg/h) on postoperative sleep disturbance in patients under general anesthesia. Intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring was implemented with focused analysis of relative wavelength frequencies.
. Patients undergoing surgery received a continuous intraoperative esketamine infusion at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/h. Concurrent electroencephalography (EEG)monitoring was performed, with the analysis specifically focusing on relative power percentages of the EEG signal.Preoperatively, levels of melatonin (quantified using mass spectrometry), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP)were measured.Postoperative sleep quality was then assessed on days 1 and 3 using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), where a score > 6 was defined as sleep disturbance.
The esketamine group exhibited significantly lower rates of sleep disturbance on postoperative day 1 (37/75 [49.3%] vs. 19/75 [25.3%];P = 0.002) and day 3 (27/75 [36.0%] vs. 14/75 [18.7%];P = 0.017). Significant intergroup differences in acute postoperative pain were observed. The EEG analysis demonstrated that the slow-wave activity composite index (PCI) serves as a robust predictor for postoperative sleep disturbance risk(OR = 0.25, 95% CI:0.139-0.479;P < 0.001).Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of postoperative sleep disturbance (PSD): Esketamine administration (OR 0.274; 95% CI 0.088-0.854);Preoperative melatonin levels (per-unit increase: OR 1.039; 95% CI 1.013-1.065);Preoperative HADS-A anxiety score (OR 1.396; 95% CI 1.075-1.813);preoperative IL-6 levels (OR 1.274; 95% CI 1.025-1.583);Postoperative pain score (OR 2.340; 95% CI 1.483-3.692);PC1 (OR 0.25, 95% CI: 0.139-0.479).
Perioperative esketamine administration significantly reduces postoperative sleep disturbance (PSD) incidence and early postoperative pain severity. Independent risk factors for PSD include preoperative melatonin deficiency, anxiety symptoms (HADS-A), preoperative IL-6 elevation, and acute postoperative pain. Crucially, the slow-wave activity composite index (PCI)-reflecting esketamine-induced prefrontal delta synchronization (δ/α ratio + Delta power)-emerges as a robust predictor of PSD risk (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.139-0.479;P < 0.001).

41308542,Intraoperative burst suppression and emergence delirium in pediatric: A prospective observational study.,Journal of clinical anesthesia,2026,"Xu Q, Zhang J, Wang F, Gao Z, Li L, Nie X, Li S","Emergence delirium (ED), a common postoperative neurological disorder in children, is characterized by disturbances in consciousness, attention, disorientation, and perceptual changes. Intraoperative burst suppression has been associated with postoperative delirium in adults, and its relationship with emergence delirium in children remains unclear and controversial.
This investigation was conducted at Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, from January 2022 to January 2023. The study incorporated children aged 6 months to 9 years who were undergoing general anesthesia with electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. Intraoperative processed EEG and the incidence of burst suppression were recorded. Postoperative delirium was evaluated using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale. A score of 10 points or higher on this scale was used as an indicator of the presence of emergence delirium.
Among the 207 children enrolled, the incidence of emergence delirium was 43 % in the set of children with burst suppression, whereas it was only 7 % in the non-burst suppression set. Binary logistic regression analysis pinpointed two distinct risk factors for the emergence of delirium. These were the agent used for maintenance of anesthesia and intraoperative burst suppression. Children maintained under intravenous propofol for maintenance of anesthesia experienced 57 % lower incidence of emergence delirium than those maintained under sevoflurance for anesthesia maintenance. Furthermore, children with burst suppression were eight times more likely to develop emergence delirium, according to intraoperative processed EEG monitoring.
This study demonstrated a notable association between intraoperative burst suppression and the incidence of postoperative emergence delirium. These findings suggest that processed EEG-based monitoring and tailored anesthesia strategies may help prevent emergence delirium and other unfavorable outcomes in pediatric surgical patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41308542/

The Patient State Index (PSi), derived from processed EEG, offers a potential method to monitor depth of anaesthesia during ECT. This study examined the correlation between pre-ictal PSi and EEG-seizure duration.
In this prospective observational study, adult patients undergoing routine ECT at a Swedish university hospital were monitored using the SedLine pEEG system. Anaesthetic care followed standard protocols and the clinical team was blinded to PSi values. Pre-ictal PSi was defined as the final value prior to the ECT stimulus. EEG-seizure duration and relevant clinical variables were extracted from health records. The primary outcome was the association between pre-ictal PSi and EEG-seizure duration, analysed using a linear mixed-effects model adjusting for age and use of benzodiazepines or anticonvulsants. Secondary analyses explored sex and age effects on PSi over time and differences between baseline and pre-ictal PSi.
Eighty-seven ECT sessions in 37 patients were analysed. Median baseline PSi was 94 (IQR 4) and pre-ictal PSi was 38 (IQR 31; p < 0.001). No correlation was found between pre-ictal PSi and EEG-seizure duration. There were no significant effects of age or sex on pre-ictal PSi while there was a significant difference between sexes on baseline PSi. Artefact and EMG activity in the EEG signal were minimal.
Pre-ictal PSi was not associated with EEG-seizure duration.
This study found no evidence to support a correlation between pre-ictal Patient State index and seizure duration, thereby challenging any clinical utility for guiding ECT administration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41254981/
41251877,Evaluating the safety and efficacy of rapid bolus-only dexmedetomidine for pediatric EEG sedation: a retrospective study.,European journal of pediatrics,2025,"Biro Y, Tabi Y, Gileles-Hillel A, Rekhtman D","Dexmedetomidine is an α2-adrenergic receptor agonist known for its sedative and analgesic properties. It produces an EEG pattern resembling Stage II sleep without interfering with EEG interpretation, making it a preferred agent for pediatric sedation, particularly during EEG procedures. Traditionally administered as a bolus followed by continuous infusion, this approach can challenge workflow efficiency and staffing in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a rapid bolus-only dexmedetomidine protocol for pediatric EEG sedation. This retrospective study included pediatric patients aged 1-18 years undergoing EEG with sedation at the Hadassah Medical Center between 2015 and 2023. All patients received dexmedetomidine via intravenous bolus (1-2 mcg/kg), with additional doses (0.5-2 mcg/kg) as needed. No continuous infusion was used. Primary outcomes were sedation success rate, time to onset and recovery, and adverse events. A total of 345 patients were included. Sedation was successfully achieved in 99% of cases, with a median sedation onset of 5 min. The overall adverse event rate was 8.4%, with no sentinel events. Hypotension and hypoxia occurred in 1.7% of patients each. Patients with upper airway abnormalities were more likely to require additional doses (P = 0.001) and showed a trend toward increased adverse events (P = 0.095). Adverse event risk increased with higher total dexmedetomidine doses (≥ 3 mcg/kg, P = 0.001).  Conclusion: Rapid bolus administration of dexmedetomidine without continuous infusion provides effective sedation for pediatric EEG, with a good safety profile, similar to other sedation protocols. This cost-effective approach offers significant advantages for settings with limited staffing or high patient turnover. What is Known: • Dexmedetomidine is well known as an effective agent for EEG procedural sedation. What is New: • We present a novel IV single bolus protocol utilizing dexmedetomidine that demonstrates a high success rate in achieving adequate sedation, is associated with a low incidence of adverse events, and requires an overall lower dosage compared to traditional methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41251877/

In this single-centre retrospective study, we analysed processed electroencephalographic (EEG) data from 439 patients who underwent general anaesthesia for cardiac surgery. We employed data visualisation techniques, such as histograms and heat maps. We conducted statistical analyses using correlation coefficients, receiver operating characteristics, and linear regression to evaluate Narcotrend performance under various BSR conditions.
The NCT index demonstrated distinct ""peak"" values (37, 46, and 61), which occurred with a probability more than two standard deviations above the overall index distribution (BSR = 0). During steady-state anaesthesia, 70% [Q1, Q3: 67,72] of values were within the manufacturer-recommended range for adequate anaesthesia, 22% [Q1, Q3: 21,29] were below, and 8% [Q1, Q3: 6,12] were above. With the onset of BSR > 0, NCT decreased significantly (p < 0.001) but showed significant variability immediately before and after automated burst suppression detection. Approximately 13% [Q1, Q3: 9,24] of NCT readings were non-interpretable. These brief episodes increased significantly with patient age (p = 0.013) and were not attributable to concurrent burst suppression.
The Narcotrend index remains within recommended ranges during steady-state anaesthesia in a predominantly male patient cohort undergoing cardiac surgery. However, index performance decreases with age, and the high incidence of non-interpretable readings in elderly patients highlights the need for cautious interpretation, despite their short duration. Automatically detected burst suppression (BSR > 0) leads to a near-instant decrease in NCT values, suggesting a technical link between the algorithms. ""Peak"" index values indicate an irregular scaling in the distribution of NCT index values.

PNDs can present with hypoactive symptoms such as lethargy, hyperactive symptoms such as confusion and disorientation or a mix of both. PNDs can affect patients of all ages; however, the incidence of PNDs increases significantly as patients age. It is important to promptly recognize PNDs as patients can have higher morbidity and mortality, longer hospital stays, higher readmissions rates, and additional testing/treatment after discharge. In this review, we explore the molecular basis involved in brain aging as well as the mechanisms involved in anesthesia exposure and the development of PNDs. Understanding the mechanisms behind brain aging and the parallels to the pathophysiology of PNDs such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic disruption are integral to mitigating the incidence and severity of PNDs. Current research suggests possible clinical targets for management such as dexmedetomidine and NSAIDs due to their abilities to combat harmful neuroinflammatory effects. Additionally, EEG-guided anesthesia, careful choice of anesthetics, and supportive measures can aid in mitigating PNDs. By understanding the mechanisms of brain aging, the risk factors for and pathophysiology of PNDs, we can better tailor our management of PNDs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41226311/

High-density EEG was recorded in 60 patients randomly receiving propofol, dexmedetomidine, or ketamine with a constant rate infusion. Spectral power, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), coherence and directed phase transfer entropy during awake, LOR and recovery (ROR) states were analyzed to evaluate neural dynamics associated with altered conscious states.
Propofol increased global alpha power and low-frequency slow oscillations (SO) without ""alpha anteriorization"" during LOR. Dexmedetomidine increased SO but decreased alpha power. Ketamine reduced alpha power and increased occipital theta and gamma power. Further, three anesthetic displayed distinct PAC patterns and induced region-specific and frequency-specific long-range functional connectivity patterns. Directed connectivity analysis indicated propofol and ketamine rather than dexmedetomidine inhibited feedback connectivity during LOR.
Three anesthetics induced differential spectral power, PAC, and network connectivity during the transition to and from LOR when infused with a constant rate, suggesting that EEG dynamics vary not only among anesthetics, but also among regimens of their administration.

The reported incidence of postoperative delirium is variable but notably high in cardiothoracic, orthopedic, and general surgery. The etiology of postoperative delirium is known to be multifactorial, with prevention being the most effective strategy currently available. This study aims to explore the potential benefits of positive suggestions delivered via headphones during general anesthesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium and improving postoperative pain, nausea, and cognitive outcomes in elderly orthopedic patients.
This randomized controlled double-blinded trial will involve patients aged 60 and above undergoing elective hip or knee surgery under general anesthesia. Participants will be randomized into three groups: a control group receiving no auditory intervention and two intervention groups receiving positive therapeutic suggestions via headphones from either a male or female speaker. The primary outcome is the incidence of postoperative delirium within 5 days after surgery that will be assessed by using the 4AT and 3DCAM. Secondary outcomes include pain intensity, which is measured intraoperative by nociception level index (NOL) and postoperative by NRS, medication consumption as well as postoperative nausea and vomiting. Data will be collected before, during, and after surgery as well as 3 months after surgery.
This study hypothesizes that positive auditory suggestions can reduce postoperative delirium incidence, lower pain intensity as well as pain medication use, and decrease postoperative nausea, vomiting incidence, and severity. Additionally, gender differences in response to male versus female voices will be explored. The findings could offer a non-invasive, cost-effective method to enhance postoperative recovery in elderly patients, potentially leading to changes in perioperative care practices.

Study outcomes pointed to a highly frequent mild-moderate hypotension: The EEG/Paed patients with predictors of a mean arterial pressure (MAP) reduction demonstrated significantly lower heart rate at baseline, enhanced delta+theta activity and higher depth of sedation. Measures like administration of fluids and use of vasopressors were for hypotensive episodes and they responded well within few minutes. The findings show the necessity of efficient procedures for controlling anesthesia for the improvement of effectiveness, safety and risk reduction during surgery.

Three female patients with late-onset AD (LOAD) retained strong EEG entrainment and showed less decline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and Functional Assessment Scale (FAS) scores compared to matched controls from National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS). Plasma samples were available for only two of five participants - both with LOAD - and both showed pTau217 reductions of 47% and 19%.
These findings suggest that long-term 40 Hz audiovisual stimulation is safe, feasible, and may offer cognitive and biomarker benefits in some individuals with mild AD, supporting further investigation.

Five mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients safely used daily 40 Hz audiovisual stimulation for 2 years. Late-onset AD (LOAD) patients showed increased 40 Hz electroencephalography (EEG) power and improved cognitive scores. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) data enhanced early-phase analysis and support precision medicine in AD studies. Plasma pTau217 declined in 2 LOAD patients after 2 years of daily use.

To address this limitation, we constructed a rigorous mathematical framework, Weakly Orthogonal Conjugate Contrast Analysis (WOCCA), which decomposes the whole-brain neural oscillations into traveling waves with independent directionality. Propagating patterns in alpha-band resting-state EEG are resolved as a combination of rotational, longitudinal, and horizontal traveling wave components. The intensity, directionality, and morphological characteristics of these wave components account for the differences between cognitive states during rest and the rapidly changing dynamics of consciousness levels during sedation. Moreover, the WOCCA decomposition encompassed the state transition dynamics captured by EEG Microstate Analysis, a conventional analysis framework for alpha waves. These results not only established an effective technique for resolving and analyzing traveling waves but also provided evidence for the relationship between wave directionality and cooperative interactions in brain network.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41110655/

This retrospective cohort study included all resuscitated patients aged ≥18 after cardiac arrest (CA) admitted to the intensive care unit of two large Dutch teaching hospitals. In one hospital all CA patients were sedated with sevoflurane only and cooled to 36 °C, while in the other hospital the patients were sedated with propofol and cooled to 33 °C. EEG patterns at 12 and 24 h after CA were analyzed visually and quantitatively and classified as favorable, unfavorable or other EEG patterns. Quantitative parameters including background continuity index, burst-suppression amplitude ratio, and alpha-delta ratio were compared between groups of sedation. Outcome at 6 months was defined as good (Cerebral Performance Category 1 or 2) or poor (Cerebral Performance Category 3, 4 or 5).
We included 412 patients of whom 51 sevoflurane-sedated and 361 propofol-sedated. Predicting good outcome at 12 h after CA, we found a higher sensitivity for those sedated with sevoflurane (0.89, 95 %-CI 0.62-1.00), as compared with those sedated with propofol (0.42, 95 %-CI 0.34-0.50), without significant loss of specificity (0.71, 95 %-CI 0.44-0.91 and 0.88, 95 %-CI 0.81-0.92 respectively). No significant differences in sensitivity and specificity were found between sedation with sevoflurane and propofol for predicting good outcome using the EEG at 24 h after CA. For prediction of poor outcome at 12 and 24 h after CA, no significant differences were found between patients sedated with sevoflurane and propofol regarding sensitivity and specificity.
In this non-randomised two-centre cohort study, sevoflurane sedation was associated with less frequent discontinuous EEG 12 h after cardiac arrest, enabling earlier and reliable prediction of good outcome. Prediction of poor outcome was reliable with both sevoflurane and propofol.

While this intervention prevents the spread of seizures, it raises important questions. Given the complete isolation from sensory-motor pathways, it remains unclear whether the disconnected cortex retains any form of inaccessible awareness. More broadly, the activity patterns that large portions of the deafferented cortex can sustain in awake humans remain poorly understood. We address these questions by exploring for the first time the electroencephalographic (EEG) state of the isolated cortex during wakefulness before and after surgery in 10 pediatric patients, focusing on non-epileptic background activity. Post-surgery, the isolated cortex exhibited prominent slow oscillations (<2 Hz) and a steeper broad-band spectral decay, reflecting a redistribution of power toward lower frequencies. This broad-band EEG slowing resulted in a marked decrease of the spectral exponent, a validated consciousness marker, reaching values characteristic of deep anesthesia and the vegetative state. When compared with a reference pediatric sample across the sleep-wake cycle, the spectral exponent of the contralateral cortex aligned with wakefulness, whereas that of the isolated cortex was consistent with deep NREM sleep. The findings of prominent slow oscillations and broad-band slowing provisionally support inferences of absent or reduced awareness in the isolated cortex. Moreover, the persistence of unihemispheric sleep-like patterns years after surgery provides unique insights into the long-term electrophysiological effects of cortical disconnections in the human brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41100501/

Patients hospitalized for ECT regularly take antidepressants or adjuvant antipsychotics, both can influence the quality of seizures. Adaptation of the seizure threshold during an ECT series necessitates adjustments in treatment parameters to ensure adequate seizure quality.
We report the case of a 46-year-old man with treatment-resistant depression treated with bupropion and ECT, who developed a spontaneous seizure after first-time etomidate anesthesia induction, as previously induced seizures under thiopental were considered insufficient. Serendipitously, an electroencephalogram (EEG) of the seizure was recorded.
The characteristics of the EEG captured after this spontaneous seizure were similar to those of regular ECT seizures under thiopental anesthesia in this patient. After returning to thiopental anesthesia, the remaining ECT course was unremarkable, and the patient's depressive symptoms improved partially.
Accordingly, the use of etomidate as an anesthesia induction agent for ECT in patients who are concomitantly using bupropion needs to be cautiously considered. The case of a documented etomidate-induced seizure could indicate the relatively benign course of such events.

This article reviews the educational gap, articulates why anesthesiologists should acquire foundational competence in interpreting raw EEG and spectrograms in addition to processed indices, and proposes a simulation-based strategy to deliver standardized, hands-on training. The rationale is grounded in current practice constraints and contrasted with the trainability and clinical utility of waveform interpretation. The proposed approach uses an EEG simulator integrated with a commercial monitor to create reproducible scenarios that progress from induction to emergence and burst suppression, allowing deliberate practice, artifact recognition, and discussion of index lag and clinical implications. As supportive evidence, a one-hour faculty development session using the SEDSIM-SedLine setup elicited uniformly positive evaluations from respondents, who rated usefulness, realism, and impact on EEG interpretation at the highest level and identified priority use cases such as TIVA, select neuroanesthesia, and frail/high-risk patients. These early impressions suggest simulation can feasibly address the documented training gap and provide a scalable pathway for competency-based EEG education, while future work should formalize curricula, assessment benchmarks, and longitudinal outcomes.
This article synthesizes the need for perioperative EEG education in anesthesiology, delineate the current training gap, and propose a novel simulation-based strategy to standardize and accelerate competency in raw EEG and spectrogram interpretation; secondarily, to present early user feedback from a pilot faculty session as supportive evidence for feasibility and educational value.

A one-hour, highly interactive simulation comprising a concise didactic review (PSI, spectral edge frequency, suppression ratio, raw EEG and DSA interpretation) followed by four guided scenarios: induction, emergence, burst suppression, and anesthetic agent effects. The format emphasized real-time interpretation, artifact awareness, index lag during state transitions, and clinical decision-making.
Post-session survey of satisfaction, perceived usefulness, realism, and impact on EEG interpretation skills. Respondents reported high engagement; most rated usefulness, skill impact, and realism at 5/5.

Therefore, it has been recommended by several societies and organisations. Yet, many clinicians only consider the processed indices, even though they are prone to interference and their information value is limited in many situations. To use EEG monitoring systems to their full potential, clinicians need to be able to integrate all information provided. Here, we introduce a structured teaching course and evaluate its effect on the participants' knowledge and attitudes.
The course contents were derived from learning goals, that we considered as required to leverage the full potential of the EEG monitoring systems. The course structure was built using several didactic tools to facilitate learning, including a high level of algorithmisation as well as tools for knowledge repetition, activation, and transfer. To investigate the effects of the course, we compared the participants' self-ratings of their knowledge with regard to the learning goals as well as their attitudes towards using EEG monitoring before and after the course. For this purpose, we anonymously questioned the participants of one course conducted in Greifswald/Germany in December 2023.
The ratings of 36 participants before and after the course show that participation led to a significant improvement in knowledge throughout all learning goals (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, p < 0.001 for each learning goal). Self-ratings of knowledge and competence increased across all learning goals from a mean of 1.9 before the course to 4.0 after the course, rated on Likert scales between 0 ('No knowledge/competency') and 5 ('Expert knowledge/competency'). Furthermore, the attitude towards applying EEG monitoring during general anaesthesia improved significantly (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.019) from 3.0 ± 1.7 to 3.8 ± 1.2 (mean ± sd), rated on a Likert scale between 0 ('never') and 5 ('always').
We show that the course improves the participants' self-ratings of knowledge with and attitude towards EEG monitoring. By providing teaching methods and resources with standardized contents we aim to facilitate training of the highest quality and motivating clinicians to improve anaesthesia practice, and ultimately patient outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40975762/

Our objective is to present pragmatic strategies for placing whole-scalp, high-density EEG systems perioperatively that enable more comprehensive analysis.
We present the successful implementation of wireless high-density (72-channel) EEG in the perioperative setting for the ongoing Caffeine, Postoperative Delirium, and Change in Outcomes after Surgery (CAPACHINOS-2) clinical trial (NCT05574400). Placement time was calculated, impedance and data quality were assessed, and data acquisition and analysis pipelines were established. Lastly, proof-of-principle analyses using source localization were conducted.
High-density wireless EEG data have been successfully acquired for n = 45 participants, with median (interquartile range) placement time of 34 (25 - 52) minutes. Data acquisition was supported by an established workflow, and a subsequent data processing pipeline was used to evaluate channel quality, remove artifacts, and generate proof-of-principle high-density analyses.
Compared to a low-density system used for a similar, previous clinical trial (n = 54 participants), preoperative median impedance values (kΩ) were lower with the high-density system (13 [11-16] vs. 39 [28-47] kΩ; p < 0.001). Additionally, proof-of-principle analysis demonstrates a more complex connectivity matrix and broader distribution of cortical alpha rhythms after induction of general anesthesia with the high-density system, highlighting an expanded capacity for neurophysiologic analysis.

SWA can be monitored using the C-Trend Index, a recently developed dynamic numerical index computed using commercially available medical device software.
This is a pre-planned prospective substudy of the randomized controlled Sedation, TEmperature and Pressure after Cardiac Arrest and REsuscitation (STEPCARE) trial. With a factorial design, the STEPCARE trial evaluates the effects of three different interventions (sedation, temperature management, and mean arterial blood pressure) on functional outcomes in adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. We will record continuous EEG (cEEG) starting as early as possible after ICU admission. We will compare the accuracy (the proportion of correct predictions of all predictions) of C-Trend Index with that of blinded retrospective visual analysis of cEEG at 12 h after return of spontaneous circulation in predicting favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-3) 6 months after cardiac arrest. We aim to recruit 300 patients to show noninferiority in prognostic accuracy of the C-Trend Index compared with the visual analysis of cEEG, using a 2% limit for noninferiority. Furthermore, we will assess whether the therapeutic intervention related to sedation, carried out as a part of the STEPCARE trial modifies the performance of the EEG-based predictors.
The study will compare the accuracy of SWA measured using C-Trend Index with the gold standard, visual analysis of cEEG, in predicting favorable functional outcome after OHCA. The study will also assess the effect of the sedation intervention of the STEPCARE trial on the predictive accuracy of C-Trend Index. If the accuracy of the C-Trend Index is non-inferior to the comparator's, it may provide a feasible and easy-to-learn bedside method, especially in hospitals with limited availability of neurophysiology expertise.

The Fast Acute Sedation at Intensive Care vs. High-Dose IV Anti-Seizure Medication for Treatment of Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus (FAST) trial aims to compare the efficacy of rapid sedation in the ICU vs. add-on high-dose IV ASM alone for the treatment of refractory SE.
This prospective, randomized, multicenter trial will enroll adult patients with non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) who either meet current EEG criteria or have unambiguous NCSE with minor motor phenomena (""subtle SE"") but without ongoing tonic-clonic seizures that are refractory to benzodiazepines and treatment with at least one second-line ASM. Patients will be randomized to receive either rapid deep sedation for 20 hours with propofol and eventually low-dose midazolam or additional high-dose IV anticonvulsant therapy (levetiracetam, valproate, fosphenytoin, lacosamide, or topiramate) in the intermediate care unit. The primary endpoint is treatment failure, either defined as NCSE on EEG 24 hours after randomization or persistent NCSE after 3 hours despite therapy on continuous EEG or clinically. Secondary endpoints include assessment of new-onset neurologic deficits and modified Rankin Scale at discharge, economic analyses, length of hospital stay, in-hospital infections, and survival. Evaluations will be performed at baseline, discharge, and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The target sample size is 116 patients; we expect to have to randomize about 140 patients to reach the required number of patients.
The FAST trial is the first randomized clinical trial to investigate refractory NCSE. Regardless of the outcome, the results of this trial protocol will provide new class 1 evidence for the treatment of NCSE and establish the standard of care for this patient population in the future.

While both remimazolam tosilate and etomidate provide hemodynamic stability during anesthesia induction, limited research has directly compared their effects on electroencephalogram (EEG) burst suppression (periods of transient brain wave silence), a potential predictor of adverse neurological outcomes. This study aims to compare the incidence rate of EEG burst suppression (ESR) with remimazolam tosilate versus etomidate by reviewing the drug regimens used by different anesthesiologists in clinical practice.
This single-center retrospective study analyzed clinical anesthesia induction data from 161 patients from October 2023 to July 2024. Patients received either remimazolam tosilate (0.2 mg/kg, n=86, Group R) or etomidate (0.3 mg/kg, n=75, Group E) for general anesthesia induction. Primary outcomes included ESR and its duration during induction. Second outcomes comprised hemodynamic parameters: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure mean arterial pressure, and heart rate, measured at baseline (T0), 3 minutes post-induction (T1), immediately after intubation (T2), 5 minutes post-intubation (T3), 10 minutes post-intubation (T4), and adverse events occurrence.
Baseline characteristics were comparable except ASA classification (higher ASA III proportion in Group R: 24.4% vs 2.7%, P<0.001). No ESR occurred in Group R versus 29.34% in Group E (P<0.01). Group R had a significantly lower incidence of intubation-related hypertension (10.5% vs 42.7%, P<0.001) and maintained stable blood pressure and HR throughout induction, whereas Group E exhibited marked MAP and HR fluctuations. Other adverse events showed no significant inter-group differences.
Remimazolam tosilate demonstrated notable differences compared to etomidate during general anesthesia induction, including the absence of ESR and different hemodynamic response patterns.

On the other hand, patients with severe dental phobias or with intellectual disability who have a severe gag reflex often require deeper levels of anesthesia. Thus, achieving an optimal level of anesthesia can be difficult in patients with cardiovascular compromise because of the relatively narrow range of sedative dosing capable of providing sufficient sedation to prevent the gag reflex without compromising hemodynamics. We present a patient with Fontan circulation, severe intellectual disability, and a severe gag reflex who underwent dental treatment using intravenous sedation. Processed electroencephalography (EEG) via a SedLine (Masimo Corporation) monitor was used to identify anesthetic depth, and propofol infusion rates were adjusted based on changes in Patient State Index (PSI) values. However, the PSI values fluctuated greatly in response to stimuli and changes in the depth of anesthesia. In summary, the indications for using feedback control of the sedation level by way of EEG analysis and adjusting propofol infusion rates might be limited in patients with cardiovascular compromise and severe gag reflex because such monitoring may be incapable of keeping pace with rapid changes in the balance between stimulation and the level of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40925630/

However, this transition point for treating refractory ICPs with DHC is unclear as ICPs can often be controlled with escalating doses of medical management. A more individualized and precise way to monitor and define medically ?refractory ICP? may be achieved with the utilization of a quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) parameter called burst suppression ratio (BSR). This technical note describes a novel device to continuously gather EEG data from subgaleal electrodes. We present two cases where BSR (i.e. an EEG-derived marker) was associated with maximal cortical suppression, indicating refractory ICP and indication for decompression. Two patients [severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) and ruptured arteriovenous malformation (AVM)] had BSRs measured through placement of novel subgaleal EEG electrodes. Although both patients had ICPs controlled by a combination of sedation, hyperosmolar therapy, and hypothermia, the BSR over a 20-24 hour period quickly reached almost-complete EEG suppression (BSR > 90%). Each case had different reasons for delaying DHC, however both reached maximal medical therapy. Given the limit of ICP control was reached, DHC was conducted in both cases. Patient 1 failed to recover and was compassionately extubated. Patient 2 clinically recovered and was discharged to acute rehabilitation. These cases illustrate that utilization of a novel subgaleal EEG system to continuously monitor BSR in patients who are being medically managed for ICP control may be used to select appropriate candidates for surgical decompression. In our two cases, a threshold BSR value > 90% (induced by medical therapy) was associated with the indication for DHC.

This study aimed to determine the effects of different doses of dexmedetomidine on postoperative QoR in elderly TKA patients, and whether there is a correlation with specific EEG changes.
In this randomized controlled trial, elderly patients (aged ≥ 60 years) undergoing elective TKA were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to 0.6 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine (Group D2), 0.3 μg/kg/h dexmedetomidine (Group D1) and saline (Group N). On postoperative days 1 and 3, the15-item Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) scale was used to evaluate the postoperative recovery of patients among the three groups. Perioperative EEG data were also recorded.
The difference of QoR-15 scores on postoperative day 1 was significant for Group D2 vs Group N (126 [123-129] points vs 120 [116-123] points; median difference, 6 points [95% CI, 4 to 8];
A loading dose of dexmedetomidine (0.5 μg/kg) infused within 10 minutes before anesthesia induction, followed by a maintenance at 0.6 μg/kg/h, improved QoR-15 on postoperative day 1 in elderly TKA patients, which may be partly related to the fact that dexmedetomidine deepens anesthesia by increasing the slow oscillation peak power in the appropriate range.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40904547/

Observational or interventional original research studies, conducted in adult critically ill patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, evaluating any objective sedation monitoring practice (e.g., electroencephalography [EEG]), and reporting on duration of mechanical ventilation or other secondary outcomes (e.g., length of stay) were included.
Meta-analysis was performed for pooled estimates of the primary outcome and each individual secondary outcome using random-effects modeling.
Twenty studies (3410 patients) were included with 15 studies evaluating processed EEG monitoring, 2 evaluating EEG monitoring, and 3 evaluating processed facial electromyography (EMG). Processed EEG was not associated with reduced duration of mechanical ventilation (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.33; 95% CI, -0.91 to 0.25; I2 = 84.4%). Secondary outcomes of processed EEG monitoring showed decreased hospital length of stay (days) (SMD -0.89; 95% CI, -1.17 to -0.62; I2 = 13.4%), reduced total sedative dose (reported in propofol equivalents, mg) (SMD -1.29; 95% CI, -2.27 to -0.31; I2 = 96.6%), and reduced total opioid dose (reported in morphine equivalents, mg) (SMD -0.40; 95% CI, -0.76 to -0.04; I2 = 77.0%). Processed facial EMG was associated with an increased risk of adverse events (risk ratio 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03-1.90; I2 = 0.00%). Risk of bias was serious for 65% (n = 13/20) of included studies.
Processed EEG monitoring is not associated with reduced duration of mechanical ventilation but may be associated with reduced sedative and opioid exposure and decreased hospital length of stay.

Here we propose the intrinsic probability density function (iPDF) as a quantitative method to evaluate the dynamic inter-cortical interactions that underlie conscious states. First, the method utilizes empirical mode decomposition to derive intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from EEG signals. Then, the method generates scale-dependent probability density functions for successive partial sums of IMFs that can capture subtle variations in neural modulation patterns. We tested the iPDF analysis across various consciousness states such as general anesthesia, distinct sleep stages (wakefulness, REM, and deep sleep), sensory conditions (eyes open versus eyes closed), and between dementia patients and healthy subjects. Our findings reveal that active neural interactions or modulations during wakefulness and REM sleep are characterized by super-Gaussian iPDF patterns. By contrast, the reduced interactions observed in anesthesia and deep sleep yield near-Gaussian iPDF profiles. We also present a classification model built on iPDF features that achieved an accuracy of approximately 87 % in distinguishing dementia patients from health controls, demonstrating the iPDF as a potential biomarker in clinical screening. This study supports the idea that consciousness emerges from complex, scale-dependent neural processes and presents a robust, quantitative framework that may enhance both our theoretical understanding and practical assessment of various states of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40780318/

In patients with early acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF), the authors used the odds ratio product, an electroencephalography (EEG)-based metric used to quantify the sleep-wake continuum. Despite patients behaviorally appearing asleep, the authors observed and quantified novel EEG patterns previously unobserved during natural sleep, and hypothesized that these unnatural EEG patterns (EEG Ups ) reflect the effect of sedation. The objective of the study was to explore the relevance of EEG Ups (never or extremely rarely seen in sleep studies) and their association with sedation at the early phase of AHRF.
This was a prospective cohort study including patients mechanically ventilated for AHRF and Pa o2 /fraction of inspired oxygen less than 200 mmHg receiving various sedation-opioid regimens and doses as per clinical indication. Continuous EEG monitoring was performed from study inclusion until extubation, death, or up to 7 days. EEG quantified the relative power of each frequency band (slow delta, fast delta plus theta, alpha-sigma, beta) and determined the frequency of EEG Ups .
A total 1,832 h of EEG recordings were analyzed (mean ± SD, 43 ± 25 h/patient) from 23 patients (median [interquartile range, 25 to 75%], 58 [48 to 70] yr; 87% male; Pa o2 /fraction of inspired oxygen, 150 [116 to 198] mmHg; intensive care unit mortality, 22%). EEG Ups accounted for 42% of the total recording time overall, differed among drug combinations, and exceeded 50% with some sedation-opioid combinations. Brief wake intrusions, a marker of physiologic sleep, were extremely low. EEG Ups prevalence was higher with sedation-opioid combinations ( P ≤ 0.029), high sedation dose ( P ≤ 0.035), and deeper clinical sedation score ( P ≤ 0.024), and was associated with intensive care unit mortality ( P < 0.001).

This study provides a bibliometric analysis of EEG-based hypnosis research, mapping key trends, contributors, and emerging themes. A Scopus-based bibliometric analysis was conducted on January 24, 2025, retrieving 135 publications using relevant keywords. The study examined publication trends, leading authors, institutions, contributing countries, journal sources, and keyword co-occurrence networks using VOSviewer. Findings show a publication upwelling from 2013 to 2015, followed by stable growth (2016-2024). The United States, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom lead the field, with Harvard Medical School and the University of Washington as the most prominent institutions. Keyword co-occurrence analysis revealed four primary research clusters: (1) neurophysiological mechanisms of hypnosis, (2) clinical applications in pain management and anesthesia, (3) EEG-based markers of hypnotizability, and (4) intersections with sleep and consciousness. Emerging themes include the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), neurofeedback, and virtual reality (VR) technologies. The findings suggest that hypnosis is increasingly conceptualized as a quantifiable neurophysiological process. However, methodological inconsistencies - particularly in EEG protocols and hypnotic induction techniques - limit cross-study comparability. Future research should prioritize methodological standardization to improve cross-study comparability and reproducibility, international collaboration to address geographic disparities, and the incorporation of advanced neurotechnology to enable real-time monitoring and personalized hypnotic interventions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40758208/

This narrative review advocates for an updated nomenclature and terminology in the classification of postoperative cognitive changes and summarizes the current understanding of the most important risk factors for postoperative delirium, focusing on patient-specific, anesthetic, and procedural aspects, including the impact of regional versus general anesthesia. Mounting evidence suggests that appropriate anesthetic depth as monitored by processed electroencephalogram (EEG) is important to preserve baseline postoperative cognitive function in vulnerable patients. The potential roles of cognitive prehabilitation, perioperative medications such as dexmedetomidine and antipsychotics, and early mobilization as well as maintenance of sleep quality for mitigating postoperative cognitive alterations are addressed to aid the practitioner in developing comprehensive care plans emphasizing brain health for this at-risk population. Current evidence highlights an urgent need for additional research in this domain of patient care. Targeted clinician education to understand the multifactorial and complex factors contributing to this perioperative conundrum is essential. Improvements in the prevention, monitoring, and treatment of postoperative cognitive alterations, especially in older adults with pre-existing cognitive conditions, remain an unmet need.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40716003/

We use a ""transitional click train"" paradigm, which concatenates two click trains with slightly differing inter-click intervals (ICIs), to investigate temporal integration in the human brain. Using a 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG), we recorded responses from healthy participants exposed to regular and irregular transitional click trains and conducted change detection tasks. Regular transitional click trains elicited significant change responses in the human brain, indicative of temporal integration, whereas irregular trains did not. These neural responses were modulated by length, contrast, and regularity of ICIs. Behavioral data mirrored EEG findings, showing enhanced detection for regular conditions compared to irregular conditions and pure tones. Furthermore, variations in change responses were associated with decision-making processes. Temporal continuity was critical, as introducing gaps between click trains diminished both behavioral and neural responses. In clinical assessments, 22 coma patients exhibited diminished or absent change responses, effectively distinguishing them from healthy individuals. Our findings identify distinct neural markers of temporal integration and highlight the potential of transitional click trains for clinical diagnostics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40715543/

40683805,Response of the Conox quantitative electroencephalographic monitor to neuromuscular block in awake volunteers.,British journal of anaesthesia,2025,"Schuller PJ, Pretorius JPG, Newbery KB","The Conox monitor analyses the frontal EEG to generate two indices of anaesthetic effects: qCON, intended to indicate the level of consciousness, and qNOX, designed to reflect responsiveness to noxious stimuli. Two similar quantitative EEG devices, BIS and Entropy, have been shown to require muscle activity (EMG) to generate accurate index values in awake individuals. Without EMG, these devices produce misleadingly low values and incorrectly suggest sedation or anaesthesia despite the cortical EEG showing the subjects are awake. As EMG affects frequency bands used by Conox, it too could be incorporating muscle activity to generate high values in awake individuals.
We replayed EEGs recorded during awake paralysis to the Conox monitor via an electronic playback system to test whether it requires EMG to generate accurate values in awake subjects.
Both qCON and qNOX decreased after neuromuscular block to values consistent with sedation or anaesthesia, despite subjects being fully awake. qCON decreased below 60 in 15 of 19 trials, and qNOX decreased below 60 in 11 of 19 trials. Overall, 42% of qCON values during paralysis were <60, the level supposedly indicating anaesthesia.
Conox requires muscle activity to generate accurate values in awake individuals. Consequently, it might be an unreliable indicator of awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking drugs. Studies conducted without neuromuscular block can provide misleading guidance when applied to Conox use in paralysed patients. Clinicians should approach manufacturer guidelines with caution and not rely solely on index values to guide dosing of anaesthetic drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40683805/

Clinical need drove the characterization of propofol pharmacokinetics and concentration effect relationships in children. Subsequently, study in populations such as neonates, the critically ill, and children with obesity explored covariate influences. Target-controlled infusions also required an appreciation of effect site concentrations and time delays, and drug interactions such as those between propofol and opioids. Supraglottic airway use in children paralleled propofol use because greater depression of pharyngeal and laryngeal reactivity was noted with propofol than seen than with thiopental. Environmental concerns with the carbon footprint of inhalational agents may yet see infusions assume dominance for maintenance anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40542567/

The meta-analysis of electrophysiological interventions in patients with atrial fibrillation demonstrates that the most commonly taken medications are hypnotics (propofol and midazolam) and analgesics (remifentanil and fentanyl). A distinctive feature of these treatments is their minimal impact on electrophysiological indicators and cardiac conduction, as well as ability to induce arrhythmia and reduce negative impact on mapping and ablation. According to systematic reviews, the number of surgical interventions performed under general anesthesia and deep sedation during treatment of complex arrhythmias is increasing. It suggests a risk of developing anesthesia-related complications. The specific of surgical interventions in patients with complex cardiac arrhythmias, heterogeneity and variability of traumatic and reflexogenic effect, as well as individual pain threshold require objective evaluation of anesthesia depth and level of analgosedation in the perioperative period. This tendency necessitates the development of multimodal monitoring approaches, providing observation of analgesia and nocicetsia balance. Methods based on the analysis evolving in response to nociceptive stimulation of automatic nervous system activity, including heart rate variability (HRV), and methods based on evaluating electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) patterns are used for objective assessment of periprocedural analgesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40466713/

These biomarkers provide insights into consciousness levels, severity, and outcomes. This study aims to determine the potential of these biomarkers in predicting the mortality and neurological outcome of severe COVID-19 patients.
We examined severe COVID-19 patients who required mechanical ventilation and observed them both during sedation and after sedation cessation. Standard EEG and ECG recordings were conducted at bedside, from which 5 min of continuous data were analyzed. Using a synthetic data generation model, we evaluated bidirectional brain-heart interactions from EEG power and heartbeat dynamics series.
Our findings indicate that brain-heart interactions, especially involving cardiac parasympathetic activity, indicate the degree of patients' severity. We observed correlations with acute encephalopathy duration (coma and delirium), particularly evident in top-down markers (from brain to heart) while bottom-up signaling (from heart to brain) correlated with ICU mortality. Additionally, we noted stronger modulation of brain-heart interactions in milder patients when comparing sedation versus non-sedation conditions, compared to those in more severe states.
Our results imply that autonomic dysfunctions, as measured through brain-heart interactions, can track the pathophysiology of comatose states following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
These findings highlight the potential of brain-heart interactions as an integrated marker for autonomic function in critical care, offering a more accurate assessment of patient severity and outcomes compared to isolated cardiac or brain measures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40435855/

Despite its potential, EEG adoption remains limited in anesthesiology due to training gaps, perceived complexity, and reliance on processed EEG indices. This review examines current educational strategies and highlights the need for structured EEG education in anesthesia training.
Emerging educational methodologies include short, focused teaching sessions, electronic learning modules, simulation-based practice, real-time clinical application with feedback, and self-directed study resources. Deliberate practice, spaced repetition, and competency-based progression have shown significant promise in improving EEG interpretation skills among anesthesiologists. Research remains sparse, but existing evidence indicates that even brief, structured interventions can meaningfully enhance clinical proficiency.

The neurological wake-up test is a widely used assessment tool. However, many patients' behavioral responses during a short interruption of sedation are ambiguous or absent, yielding little prognostic value. This study assesses the brain's electroencephalogram response during an interruption of propofol sedation to complement behavioral assessment during the neurological wake-up test to predict survival, recovery of consciousness, and long-term functional outcomes in patients with acute severe brain injury.
We recorded 128-channel EEG from 41 severely brain-injured patients during a clinically indicated neurological wake-up test. Behavioral assessment was performed before and after interruption of propofol sedation, using the Glasgow Coma Scale. Brain response to sedation interruption was quantified using EEG power, spatial ratios, and the spectral exponent.
Recovery of responsiveness during the neurological wake-up test is reflected in participants' brain response to sedation interruption. Electrophysiological patterns can be decoupled from participant behavioral response, with some individuals demonstrating neurophysiological signs of waking up despite an absent behavioral response. Using the brain response to complement behavioral assessment improved prognostic value, distinguished patients according to survival and outperformed outcome predictions of the patients' attending physician.

Raw EEG can be processed mathematically, yielding quantitative EEG parameters (qEEG). We hypothesized that machine learning combined with qEEG can accurately classify expired sevoflurane concentrations in young infants. Knowledge from this may contribute to development of future infant-specific EEG algorithms. Frontal EEG collected from infants ≤ 3 months were time-matched as one-minute epochs to expired sevoflurane (eSevo). Fifteen qEEG parameters were extracted from each epoch and eight machine learning models combined the qEEG to classify each epoch into one of four eSevo levels (%): 0.1-1.0, 1.0-2.1, 2.1-2.9, and > 2.9. 64 epochs formed the post hoc SHAP dataset to determine the qEEG that contributed most to the model. The remaining epochs were randomly split 50 times into 80/20 training/testing sets. Accuracy and F1-score determined model performance. 42 infants provided 4574 epochs. The top classifiers K-nearest neighbors, default multi-layer perceptron, and support vector machine achieved 67.5-68.7% accuracy. Burst suppression ratio and entropy β were the top contributors to the models. Post hoc analysis performed without burst suppression ratio yielded similar prediction performance. In young infants, machine learning applied to qEEG predicted eSevo levels with moderate success. Burst suppression ratio, the most important contributor, represented an efficient EEG feature that encapsulated underlying EEG changes seen on other qEEG features.

Patients with acute brain injury or ischemia have complex physiology, and without caution, endotracheal intubation can inadvertently lead to secondary brain injury. This article summarizes the evidence behind airway management for patients with acute brain injury or ischemia.
We present data that will help to clarify our recommended actions before, during, and after endotracheal intubation for a patient with acute brain injury or ischemia.
The principles described in this article are centered around avoiding secondary brain injury. Before intubation, it is important to avoid extremes of blood pressure, ensure the patient is preoxygenated, and manage elevated intracranial pressure. We recommend performing a full neurological examination, if feasible. During intubation, using a hemodynamically neutral induction agent such as ketamine or etomidate minimizes the risk of hypotension, which can worsen ischemia. Ketamine was traditionally avoided but has been shown to not affect the cerebral perfusion pressure, and thus is acceptable to use in this patient population. We also recommend the use of video laryngoscopy. Following intubation, we recommend adjusting ventilator settings to target eucapnia. Adequate sedation can assist with the management of intracranial pressure. The use of electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring can identify non-convulsive status epilepticus.

A previous study demonstrated that certain electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns during emergence from general anesthesia are associated with a higher risk for PND. Compared to patients demonstrating the most favorable trajectory ( Traj Ref : delta-dominant slow-wave anesthesia (ddSWA)→spindle-dominant SWA (sdSWA)→non-SWA (nSWA)→wake), patients presenting Traj Abrupt (ddSWA→wake) had 4-fold increased odds to develop PND and patients with Traj High (nSWA→wake) had 8-fold increased odds of developing PND. We hypothesized that commonly used neuromonitoring devices (state entropy [SE], quantium consciousness index [qCON], bispectral index [BIS], and Patient State Index [PSI]) can differentiate between the various trajectories.
From the original database of the study by Hesse et al, we analyzed 59 EEGs from patients emerging from general anesthesia. They were selected according to their trajectory. We included 19 patients who had shown the most favorable trajectory ( Traj Ref ), 20 who had demonstrated Traj Abrupt , and 20 who had followed Traj High . To evaluate the performance of the neuromonitoring devices, we replayed the patients' EEGs to the monitors using an EEG player. We compared the index values for the 3 different trajectories ( TrajRef , TrajAbrupt , and Traj High ) generated by the different monitoring devices, respectively. Additionally, we evaluated the correlation between the monitoring devices.
SE and PSI were able to resolve significant differences between Traj Ref and Traj Abrupt during a major part of emergence. Traj Ref showed an almost linear increase of index values, whereas Traj Abrupt led to an episode of low index values followed by a sudden increase. However, when comparing Traj Ref vs Traj High , qCON, PSI, and BIS were the indices showing significant differences, especially at the beginning of emergence. Patients representing Traj Ref patterns had significantly lower index values than those depicting TrajHigh . Due to the TrajHigh cases starting in nSWA, their indices were already high at the start of emergence.
Our analysis revealed that the course of the different indices reflects spectral EEG patterns during the emergence from general anesthesia. Considering certain emergence trajectories associated with a higher risk of developing PND, our approach might enable the anesthetist to identify patients particularly susceptible to PND by observing the course of index values before admission to the postanesthesia care unit.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40279280/

We examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related biomarkers, cognitive scores, EEG recordings, and delirium data from 82 noncardiac, non-neurologic surgical patients ≥60 yr in age. Based on prior work, each participant's intraoperative frontoparietal EEG alpha power was anaesthetic dose-adjusted by dividing it by (2.5 minus the age-adjusted end-tidal minimum alveolar concentration), and then analysed for its association with POD and delirium risk factors, preoperative CSF AD-related biomarkers, and preoperative cognition.

In our dataset, PRD had the strongest correlation with varying remifentanil concentrations, while ANI, NOL, and qNOX did not show significant correlations with remifentanil concentrations. Following a noxious stimulus, the raw EEG in patients with low PRD exhibited a significant increase in power in the high EEG frequencies around 25 Hz and decreased power in frequencies corresponding to the alpha range (8-12 Hz) in the power spectral density.
PRD, HR, and BIS correlated with varying levels of remifentanil, with PRD exhibiting the strongest correlation. When CE remifentanil are low, noxious stimuli are more likely to dilate the pupil and be detected in the EEG. Considering the complexity of the nociceptive response, integrating multimodal neurophysiologic monitoring with pharmacological data may improve the anesthesiologist's ability to assess on the nociception-antinociception balance. However, further studies are needed to validate these findings and address the study's limitations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40220354/

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), electroencephalogram (EEG) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) in predicting good outcome, assessed separately and in combination.
A retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary CA center, using a prospective registry. We included all patients comatose after discontinuation of sedation and with one EEG and NSE blood measurement at 24, 48 or/and 72 h after CA. The primary outcome was favorable neurological outcome at three months, a Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) scale 1-2 defining a good outcome.
Between January 2017 and April 2024, 215 patients were included. Participants were 63 years old (IQR [52-73]), and 73% were male. At 3 months, 54 patients (25.1%) had a good outcome. Compared to the poor outcome group, NSE blood levels were significantly lower in the good outcome group at 24 h (39 IQR[27-45] vs 54 IQR[37-82]µg/L, p < 0.001), 48 h (26 [18-43] vs 107 [54-227]µg/L, p < 0.001) and 72 h (20 µg/L IQR [15-30] vs 184 µg/l IQR [60-300], p < 0,001). Normal NSE (i.e., < 17 µg/L) at 24 h was highly predictive of good outcome, with a predictive positive value (PPV) of 71% despite a sensitivity (Se) of 9%. The best cut-off values for NSE at 24, 48 and 72 h were below 45.5, 51.5 and 41.5 µg/L, yielding PPV of 64%, 80% and 83% and sensitivities of 74%, 93% and 90%, respectively. A decreasing trend in NSE levels between 24 and 72 h was also highly predictive of good outcome (PPV 82%, Se 81%). A benign EEG pattern was more frequently observed in the good outcome group (87.1 vs 14.9%, p < 0.001) and predicted a good outcome with a PPV of 72% and a Se of 94%. Regarding SSEPs, a bilateral N20-baseline amplitude > 0.85 µV was predictive of good outcome (PPV 75%, Se 100%). The combination of NSE < 51.5 µg/l at 48 h, a decreasing NSE trend between 24 and 72 h and a benign EEG showed the best predictive value (PPV 96%, Se 76%).
In comatose patients after CA, a low NSE levels at 24, 48 h or 72 h, a decreasing trend in NSE over time, a benign EEG and a high N20 amplitude are robust markers of favorable outcome, reducing prognosis uncertainty.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40217465/

In contrast, dreams and drug-induced dissociated states are characterized by vivid internally generated conscious experiences and reduced ability to perceive external stimuli. Understanding the physiological distinctions between normal wakefulness and dissociated states may therefore disambiguate signatures of responsiveness to external stimuli from those that underlie conscious experience. The hypothesis that conscious experiences are associated with brain criticality has received considerable theoretical and experimental support. Consistent with this hypothesis, statistical signatures of criticality are similar in normal wakefulness and dissociative states but are abolished in dreamless sleep and under anesthesia. Thus, while statistical measures of criticality are associated with the ability to have conscious experience, they do not readily distinguish between perception of the external world from internally generated percepts. Here, we investigate distinct, dynamical, signatures of criticality during escalating ketamine doses in high-density EEG in human male volunteers. We show that during normal wakefulness, EEG is found at a critical point between damped and exploding oscillations. With increasing doses of ketamine, as dissociative symptoms intensify, activity is progressively stabilized-most prominently at higher frequencies. We also show that stabilization is a more reliable marker of the effects of ketamine than conventional measures such as power spectra. These findings suggest that stabilization of cortical dynamics correlates with decreased ability to respond to and perceive external stimuli rather than the ability to have conscious experiences per se. Altogether, these results suggest that combining statistical and dynamical criticality measures may distinguish wakefulness, dissociation, and unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40204440/

However, existing studies typically analyze EEG signals across broad frequency bands, leaving the frequency-specific temporal characteristics of microstates poorly understood. In this study, we investigated frequency-specific EEG microstate features in the delta (0.5-4 Hz) and EEG-without-delta (4-30 Hz) frequency bands during propofol anesthesia. Sixty-channel EEG recordings were collected from 18 healthy male participants during wakefulness and propofol-induced unconsciousness. Microstate analysis was conducted separately for delta and EEG-without-delta frequency bands and microstate features were compared across frequency bands and conscious states. Our results revealed eight consistent microstate classes (MS1-MS8) with high topographic similarity across frequency bands, while global explained variance (GEV), mean duration (MeanDur), occurrence (Occ), and coverage (Cov) exhibited significant frequency- and state-dependent variations during propofol anesthesia. In the delta band, propofol-induced unconsciousness was associated with significantly longer MeanDur for microstate classes of MS4, MS5, and MS6 (p < 0.05). In the EEG-without-delta band, GEV, Cov, and Occ significantly increased for MS1 and MS3 (p < 0.01) and decreased for MS2 and MS4 (p < 0.05) during unconsciousness. Notably, microstate features in the EEG-without-delta band showed better sensitivity for discriminating conscious states, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.944. These findings emphasize the importance of frequency-specific microstate analysis in unraveling the neural dynamics of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness and highlight its potential clinical applications for improving anesthesia depth monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40113116/

However, it is invasive and requires profound analgo-sedation during initiation and often throughout the therapy. Managing sedation in venovenous (VV) ECMO patients is particularly challenging due to the impact of ECMO circuits on pharmacokinetics and specific patient requirements. This can lead to unpredictable sedative effects and require multiple drugs at higher doses. Additionally, sedation is usually managed with traditional scoring methods, which are subjective and invalid during neuromuscular blockade. These uncertainties may impact outcomes. Recent clinical practice increasingly focuses on reducing sedation to enable earlier physiotherapy and mobilisation, particularly in patients awaiting transplants or receiving mechanical circulatory support. In this context, processed electroencephalogram-based (pEEG) sedation monitoring might be promising, having shown benefits in general anaesthesia and intensive care. However, the technology has limitations, and its benefits in ECMO practice have yet to be formally evaluated. This review provides insights into the challenges of ECMO sedation, including pharmacokinetics, unique ECMO requirements, and the implications of inadequate sedation scores. Finally, it includes a brief overview of the practicality and limitations of pEEG monitoring during VV-ECMO, highlighting a significant research gap.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40056243/

The performance of SlopEn is investigated on just a single frontal EEG channel and is compared against other well-known entropy metrics utilized in the field. After filtering the EEG signal, four types of entropy, including SlopEn, are derived from all EEG sub-bands and separately inputted to a regressor for estimating DoA index values. Comparing the results obtained using SlopEn with those from the Sample entropy demonstrates the superiority of the former, achieving a higher correlation coefficient (0.75 vs. 0.63) and a lower median absolute error (4.2 vs. 6.2) between the estimated and reference DoA index values.

Annual International Conference,2024,"Xiong Z, Schwamb AL, Palanca BJA, Ching S","Slow-wave activity (SWA) is an electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern commonly occurring during anesthesia and deep sleep, and is hence a candidate biomarker to quantify such states and understand their connection to related phenotypes. SWA consists of individual slow waves (ISWs), high-amplitude deflections lasting for approximately 0.5 to 1 second, and occurring quasi-periodically. This latter fact poses a challenge for conventional power spectral density EEG analysis methods that perform best when there is persistent oscillatory activity. In this brief paper, we explore a time-domain detection framework for identifying and quantifying ISWs as a metric for SWA. Our method operates by quantifying the extent to which an EEG signal conforms to a canonical ISW morphology. To do this, we formulate a given univariate EEG signal in two dimensions by means of time-delay embedding. Candidate ISWs are defined as waveform segments between every two zero crossings. In the delay embedded space (DES) we define an admissible region whose traversal by a candidate wave is defined as a slow-wave occurrence. The result of this detection procedure is a binary time series indicating the occurrence of ISWs as a function of time. Once ISWs are detected, we apply a state-space estimation technique based on Kalman filtering to convert this time series into an estimate of the probability of ISW occurrence, which we term the SWA probability. The latter is posed as an instantaneous measure of SWA. We apply this method to EEG data from general anesthesia and deep sleep, establishing that it detects and tracks elevated SWA in both cases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40039115/

However, it remains unclear whether cognitive abilities are selectively impaired or what are the trends of the function. In this study, we examined the effects of acute exposure to 3800 m on cognition among 20 lowlanders (27.9 ± 3.08 years; 18 males) for 1 week. Cognitive functions, physiological parameters, various questionnaires, and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were assessed at 400 m (D0) and during the acute phase at 3800 m (D1, D2, D3, D5, D7). A control group consisting of 23 subjects (26.5 ± 3.17 years; 21 males) underwent identical assessments at 400 m. Our findings indicate that within two days following ascent to 3800 m, nearly all cognitive indicators exhibited impairment, but gradually improved from the 3rd day and largely recovered to the plain level on the 5th to 7th day. EEG frequency analysis also revealed significant alterations, relative power in the delta band decreased markedly by D7 compared with D0, while theta and alpha bands showed the opposite trends. Correlational analyses between EEG features and cognitive functions revealed that relative power in the delta band exhibited a negative correlation with most cognitive measures, while relative power in the theta and beta bands predominantly demonstrated positive correlations. We conclude that most cognitive functions exhibit a pattern characterized by initial decline followed by recovery at 3800 m-an observation closely linked to observed EEG changes.

A retrospective analysis was made of the demographic data and sleep EEG recordings of patients who underwent sleep EEG because of suspected seizure between 2021 and 2022. The study included patients aged 4 to 18 years, and patients with a new or previous diagnosis of epilepsy were excluded from the study.
Evaluation was made of 88 patients, comprising 35 (39.8%) girls and 53 (60.2%) boys with a mean age of 10.6 ± 4.3 years. In the analysis of the patients who did not sleep at all during the EEG recording, the drugs administered to the patients for sedation were observed to be hydroxyzine in 4 (14.8%) patients, chloral hydrate in 1 (2.8%) patient, and melatonin in 5 (20%) patients. Sleep duration was seen to be longer and the rates of motion artifacts and awakening during filming were lower in the patients treated with chloral hydrate.
The results of this study showed that chloral hydrate was the most effective drug for inducing sleep.

We collected data from patients undergoing general anesthesia at two hospitals and developed and compared two deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Both models were trained on expert anesthesiologists' assessments of nociception. We evaluated normalization strategies for offline and online usage and found that Min-Max normalization was most effective for our dataset. Our results demonstrate that the MLP model accurately captured nociceptive changes in response to painful surgical stimuli, whereas the LSTM model provided smoother predictions but with lower sensitivity to rapid changes.

The use of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) via somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and electroencephalography (EEG) provides continuous information regarding cerebral blood flow (CBF) during aneurysm clipping. In this study, we hypothesize that CBF changes during aneurysm clipping increase the risk of POD. We aimed to demonstrate that significant changes in IONM data during surgery increase the risk of POD after adjusting for clinical and intraoperative factors.
470 patients undergoing craniotomy for aneurysm clipping surgery with IONM were retrospectively reviewed for the development of POD. Significant IONM changes were evaluated based on a visual review of EEG and SSEP data and documentation of significant changes during surgery. Data changes during IONM were classified as SSEP changes, EEG changes, or IONM changes (SSEP and/or EEG changes).
Of the 470 patients who underwent aneurysm clipping, 115 (24.5%) had POD and 35 (30.4%) had IONM changes. IONM and SSEP changes were significantly associated with POD (p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding variables, IONM and SSEP changes were significantly associated with POD (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.4 [CI: 1.40-4.17]; p = 0.002) and (aOR 2.49 [CI: 1.39-4.45]; p = 0.002), respectively.

Patients who develop POD after craniotomy for aneurysm clipping surgery are twice as likely to have experienced significant IONM or SSEP changes during the surgery. Patients with ruptured aneurysms and who develop postoperative focal neurological deficits are also more than twice as likely to develop POD.

This prospective cohort study included 57 elderly patients scheduled for ERCP procedures. Patients received target-controlled infusion of propofol, titrated to the sedation level of MOAA/S scores of 1 and 2. The MOAA/S scores and PSI values were recorded during sedation and recovery. We also documented procedure and recovery time, oversedation (PSI < 25 for at least 10 min and EEG burst suppression), adverse events, and fatigue scores (0-10, higher scores indicating more fatigue).
All patients completed this study (mean age of 73 years and 63% male), with a mean procedure time of 53 min and recovery time of 37 min. Five patients (8.8%) experienced PSI < 25 for at least 10 min, and three of them (5.3%) showed EEG burst suppression. No patients developed desaturation or intra-procedural awareness. Hypotension and abdominal pain were uncommon. Nine patients (15.8%) experienced mild dizziness or nausea. The median (IQR) fatigue score was 3 (2-4) at recovery room discharge.

Despite considerable study, we remain uncertain which brain regions and neural oscillations are involved, as well as how they are impacted when consciousness is disrupted. The experimental data was obtained from the open-access dataset, which contains pre-processed EEG data recorded from 20 healthy participants during propofol sedation. Using unsupervised machine learning methods (i.e., non-negative matrix factorization, NMF), we investigated the spatiospectral dynamic evolution of brain activity from awake to sedation and back induced by propofol in healthy research volunteers. Our methods yielded six dynamical patterns that continuously reflect the neural activity changes in specific brain regions and frequency bands under propofol sedation. Temporal dynamic analyses showed that differences in alpha oscillation patterns were less pronounced in response group than drowsy group, with hemispheric asymmetry in posterior occipital lobe over the course of the sedation procedure. We designed an index 'hemispheric lateralization modulation of alpha [HLM(α)]' to measure asymmetry during awake state and predicting individual variability in propofol-induced alterations of consciousness states, obtaining prediction AUC of 0.8462. We present an alpha modulation index which characterizes how these patterns track the transition from awake to sedation as a function of increasing dosage. Our study reveals dynamics indices that track the evolution of neurophysiological of propofol on brain circuits.

Forty pediatric patients with external humerus condylar fractures were randomly distributed into general anesthesia (GA) and nerve block combined with general anesthesia (GNA) groups. Patients in the GA group had induction of anesthesia with propofol at 2.5 mg/kg and remifentanil at 0.6 ug/kg. The Angel-6000D EEG anesthesia depth multi-parameter monitor maintained the EEG awareness index (IOC1) between 40 and 60 and the injury sensitivity index (IOC2) between 30 and 50.
Both intraoperative propofol maintenance in the GA group (6.74 ± 0.93) and propofol maintenance in the GNA group (5.16 ± 0.76) were significantly different upon comparison between the groups (p < 0.05). Intraoperative remifentanil maintenance differed significantly (p < 0.05) between the GA group (0.26 ± 0.04) and the GNA group (0.10 ± 0.04). Comparison of awakening time: the time of eyelid opening, time of completion order, extubation time, and time of recovery of positioning function in the GNA group were markedly shorter than that of the GA group (p < 0.01) with a high level of significance.
Nerve block composite general anesthesia under multi-parameter monitoring of depth of anesthesia by Angel-6000D electroencephalogram can lead to a significant reduction in the dosage of propofol and remifentanil, advancement of awakening and extubation time and an increase in the safety of anesthesia in pediatric surgery patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39939913/

Two independent reviewers assessed papers based on eligibility criteria, which included human studies where EEG recordings were obtained during ketamine administration.
Eight papers were eligible for inclusion with 141 subjects (24 children). Seven studies (133 subjects) reported epilepsy history; 70% (94/133) of these subjects had a pre-existing epilepsy diagnosis. No (0/39) subjects without epilepsy and 28% (26/94) of subjects with epilepsy had electrographic seizures after ketamine administration.

Of the subjects with epilepsy, 14% (10/74) had CEMs vs 5% (1/21) in subjects without epilepsy. Most CEMs (9/11) were temporally correlated with electrographic seizures.
Our findings indicate that in subjects with epilepsy, electrographic seizures were frequently seen with ketamine administration and were correlated with CEMs. No seizure activity after ketamine was seen in subjects without epilepsy.

Significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding stimulation intervals (225.0 ± 34.2 s vs. 240.0 ± 0 s; p < 0.001) and the index before electric stimulation (45.0 ± 15.7 vs. 35.0 ± 13.0; p < 0.001). No significant differences in overall seizure quality were found between the groups. The midictal amplitude was higher in the anesthesia depth-guided group (209.2 ± 92.6 vs. 152.6 ± 80.0; p = 0.009). Because of inadequate anesthesia depth, 54 interventions were discontinued for safety reasons.
The number of per protocol completed interventions is small due to high exclusion rate from protocol violations.
Anesthesia depth-guided ECT management did not significantly improve overall seizure quality compared to a four-minute anesthesia-to-stimulation time interval.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39862986/

Despite its therapeutic potential, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying ketamine's effects are not fully understood. This study explored acute neurophysiological changes induced by subanesthetic doses of ketamine in BD patients with depression using electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers. A cohort of 30 BD (F = 12) inpatients with TRD undergoing ketamine treatment was included in the study. EEG recordings were performed during one of the ketamine infusions with doses ranging from 0.5 to 1 mg/kg, and subjective effects were evaluated using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Both rhythmic and arrhythmic features were extrapolated from the EEG signal. Patients who exhibited a clinical response to ketamine treatment within one week were classified as early responders (ER), whereas those who responded later were categorized as late responders (LR). Ketamine reduced low-frequency spectral power density while increasing gamma oscillatory power. Additionally, ketamine flattened the slope of the power spectra, indicating altered scale-free dynamics. Ketamine also increased brain signal entropy, particularly in high-frequency bands. Notably, LR exhibited greater EEG changes compared to ER, suggesting endophenotypic differences in treatment sensitivity. These findings provide valuable insights into the neurophysiological effects of ketamine in BD depression, highlighting the utility of EEG biomarkers for assessing ketamine's therapeutic mechanisms in real-world clinical settings. Understanding the neural correlates of ketamine response may contribute to personalized treatment approaches and improved management of mood disorders.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39809847/

The authors sought to determine whether internal electroencephalogram (EEG) subparameters extracted by the BIS monitor (Medtronic, USA), a device commonly used to estimate depth of anesthesia intraoperatively, could be repurposed to predict recovery of consciousness after cardiac arrest.
In this retrospective cohort study, a three-layer neural network was trained to predict recovery of consciousness to the point of command following versus not based on 48 h of continuous EEG recordings in 315 comatose patients admitted to a single U.S. academic medical center after cardiac arrest (derivation cohort, n = 181; validation cohort, n = 134). Continuous EEGs were partially processed into subparameters using virtualized emulation of the BIS Engine ( i.e. , the internal software of the BIS monitor) applied to signals from the frontotemporal leads of the standard 10-20 EEG montage. The model was trained on hourly averaged measurements of these internal subparameters. This model's performance was compared to the modified Westhall qualitative EEG scoring framework.
Maximum prognostic accuracy in the derivation cohort was achieved using a network trained on only four BIS subparameters (inverse burst suppression ratio, mean spectral power density, gamma power, and theta/delta power). In a held-out sample of 134 patients, the model outperformed current state-of-the-art qualitative EEG assessment techniques at predicting recovery of consciousness (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.86; accuracy, 0.87; sensitivity, 0.83; specificity, 0.88; positive predictive value, 0.71; negative predictive value, 0.94). Gamma band power has not been previously reported as a correlate of recovery potential after cardiac arrest.
In patients comatose after cardiac arrest, four EEG features calculated internally by the BIS Engine were repurposed by a compact neural network to achieve a prognostic accuracy superior to the current clinical qualitative accepted standard, with high sensitivity for recovery. These features hold promise for assessing patients after cardiac arrest.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786948/

During aortic arch reconstruction, bilateral hemispheric ADRs and SRs were recorded every five minutes in conjunction with mean arterial pressure, temperature, CPB flow, and cerebral oximetry. Data were grouped into the cooling, antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP), and rewarming periods of CPB. Correlation analysis determined relationships between the ADR, SR, and hemodynamic data. The cumulative interhemispheric ADR and SR differences were calculated during CPB. Neurological injury was defined as clinical/subclinical seizure or stroke.
Among 79 infants, the ADRs decreased significantly during rewarming, whereas SRs were significantly greatest during ACP. There was a direct correlation between the ADR and cerebral oximetry (R

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether use of a BIS monitor to guide sevoflurane administration might reduce the average end tidal sevoflurane concentration used in children 4-18 years of age.
Participants in three age groups (4-8, 9-12, and 13-18 years) were randomized to either the BIS guided group or the control group. Use of sevoflurane as the primary maintenance anesthetic was the only requirement in both arms. In the BIS guided group, sevoflurane was titrated to achieve a target BIS value of 45-60 during the maintenance period. In the control arm, clinicians were blinded to the BIS value. Primary outcome was mean end-tidal sevoflurane concentration during maintenance phase of anesthesia. Secondary assessments included time to discharge and the readiness and quality of recovery as assessed by the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale, the modified Aldrete Score, and the Wong-Baker FACES scale. An intention-to-treat analysis was used to analyze and compare groups.
A total of 180 participants were randomized. Following randomization, 10 participants did not undergo any study procedures, leaving 84 participants in the BIS guided group and 86 participants in the control group. Across all age groups, the average end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was less in the BIS guided group compared to control (4-8 years: 2.2% ± 0.3% vs. 2.4% ± 0.4%, -0.3% [-0.4%, -0.1%]; 9-12 years: 1.7% ± 0.5% vs. 2.1% ± 0.6%, -0.4% [-0.7%, -0.1%]; 13-18 years: 1.6% ± 0.4% vs. 1.9% ± 0.5%, -0.3% [-0.5%, -0.1%]). No differences in recovery outcomes between treatment groups were observed.
In pediatric participants, the BIS guided group reported a lower average end-tidal sevoflurane concentration compared to control, though no significant differences in recovery profile were noted.
The Bispectral Index (BIS) is a processed EEG tool that can be used to titrate general anesthesia to achieve desired anesthetic depth. Brain monitoring with BIS resulted in lower average end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations in children aged 4-18 years undergoing general anesthesia.

POD is associated with an increased risk for postoperative complications, long-term cognitive decline, an increase in morbidity and mortality as well as extended hospital stays. Delirium prevention and treatment options are currently limited. This study will evaluate the effect of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) on the incidence of POD.
We will perform a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial using single-session postoperative application of tES in the recovery room in 225 patients (> 65 years) undergoing elective major surgery. Patients will be randomly allocated (ratio 1:1:1) to one of three study groups: (1) alpha-tACS over posterior parietal cortex [2 mA, 20 min], (2) anodal tDCS over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [2 mA, 20 min], (3) sham [2 mA, 30 s]. Delirium will be screened twice daily with the 3-min diagnostic interview Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM) in the 5 days following surgery. The primary outcome is the incidence of POD defined as at least one positive screening during the five first postoperative days compared between tACS and sham groups. Secondary outcomes include delirium severity, duration, phenotype, postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, electroencephalographic (EEG) markers, and fluid biomarkers.
If effective, tES is a novel, easily applicable, non-invasive method to prevent the occurrence of POD. The comprehensive neurophysiological and biofluid assessments for markers of (neuro-)inflammation and neurodegeneration will shed light on the pathomechanisms behind POD and further elucidate the (after-)effects of tES. The potential implications for the postoperative recovery comprise enhanced patient safety, neurocognitive outcome, perioperative manageability but also reduced healthcare costs.

We modeled these dynamics with a Kuramoto network of 90 nodes oscillating at an intrinsic frequency of 40 Hz, interconnected using human brain structural connectivity strengths and delays. We simulated this model for 30 min to generate multi-state metastability. We identified global coupling and delay parameters that maximize spectral entropy, a proxy for multi-state metastability. At this operational point, multiple frequency-specific coherent sub-networks spontaneously emerge across oscillatory modes, persisting for periods between 140 and 4300 ms, reflecting flexible and sustained dynamic states. The topography of these sub-networks aligns with empirical resting-state neuroimaging data. Additionally, periodic components of the EEG spectra from young healthy participants correlate with maximal multi-state metastability, while dynamics away from this point correlate with sleep and anesthesia spectra. Our findings suggest that multi-state metastable functional dynamics observed in empirical data emerge from specific interactions of structural topography and connection delays, providing a platform to study mechanisms underlying flexible dynamics of cognition.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39730441/

Different approaches for measuring the important information of this biosignal are used. The most often and efficient one for entropic parameters is permutation entropy as it can distinguish the vigilance states in the different settings. Due to high calculation times, it has mostly been used for low orders, although it shows good results even for higher orders. Entropy of difference has a similar way of extracting information from the EEG as permutation entropy. Both parameters and different algorithms for encoding the associated patterns in the signal are described. The runtimes of both entropic measures are compared, not only for the needed encoding but also for calculating the value itself. The mutual information that both parameters extract is measured with the AUC for a linear discriminant analysis classifier. Entropy of difference shows a smaller calculation time than permutation entropy. The reduction is much larger for higher orders, some of them can even only be computed with the entropy of difference. The distinguishing of the vigilance states between both measures is similar as the AUC values for the classification do not differ significantly. As the runtimes for the entropy of difference are smaller than for the permutation entropy, even though the performance stays the same, we state the entropy of difference could be a useful method for analyzing EEG data.

However, their reliability in children under 2 years of age remains questionable. During anesthesia maintenance in this age group, processed EEG indices frequently exhibit unexpectedly elevated values that exceed the intended target range.
This study aimed to identify EEG spectral parameters associated with false positive elevations in processed EEG indices and investigate their differences from true positive elevations during emergence.
This prospective observational study included 50 children aged 4-24 months undergoing general anesthesia. Bispectral index (BIS), patient state index (PSi), and raw EEG were continuously recorded throughout anesthesia. False positive was defined as elevated processed EEG indices when end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was maintained at 0.7-1.3 minimum alveolar concentration, with heart rate and mean blood pressure between 80% and 120% of baseline values. We analyzed EEG power spectra and band power values during periods of false positives and compared them with those of true positives during emergence. Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05 was considered significant.
False positives in processed EEG indices were observed in 35 (70%) of the children during anesthesia maintenance, occupying 28% of the maintenance phase. These false positives were associated with decreased power in delta (269-174 dB) and theta (115-97 dB) bands, but widespread increases in alpha and beta bands, resulting in elevated spectral edge frequency (19-22 Hz). Notably, EEG band power during false positives significantly differed from those observed during emergence (delta: 52 dB, theta: 38 dB) (all p < 0.001).

We aimed to develop an ES prediction model.
Using a prospective observational study of 260 neonates with HIE undergoing CEEG, we identified clinical and EEG risk factors for ES, evaluated model performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and calculated test characteristics emphasizing high sensitivity. We assessed ES incidence and timing in neonates subdivided by ES risk group (low, moderate, high) as determined by EEG risk factors.
ES occurred in 32% (83/260) of neonates. Performing CEEG for only 24 h would fail to identify the 7% (17/260) of neonates with later onset ES (20% of all neonates experiencing ES). Identifying 90% or 95% of neonates with ES would require CEEG for 63 or 74 h, respectively. The optimal model included continuity and epileptiform discharges, both assessed in the initial 1 h of CEEG. It yielded an AUROC of .80, and at a cutoff that emphasized sensitivity, had sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 45%, positive predictive value of 44%, and negative predictive value of 95%.

Existing approaches suffer from poor performance, place a high burden on clinicians to gather data, or do not incorporate intraoperative data. Previous work demonstrated that intraoperative anesthetics induce prefrontal electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations in the alpha band (8 to 12 Hz) that correlate with postoperative cognitive outcomes.
The authors analyzed a retrospective cohort of 1,081 patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts) with intraoperative EEG recordings. The association between EEG alpha power and adverse outcomes was characterized using statistical models that were fitted on propensity weighted data. The primary outcome was postoperative mortality, measured from date of surgery to date of death or last follow-up. Secondary outcomes included mortality within prespecified time windows (30 days, 90 days, 180 days, and 1 yr), hospital and postanesthesia care unit lengths of stay, discharge to long-term care, and 30-day hospital readmission.

Additionally, alpha power was associated with discharge to long-term care (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.96; P < 0.001). We did not find significant associations among alpha power and 30-day readmission and hospital or postanesthesia care unit lengths of stay.
Intraoperative EEG alpha power is independently associated with postoperative mortality and adverse outcomes, suggesting it could represent a broad measure of postoperative physical resilience and provide clinicians with a low-burden, personalized measure of postoperative risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39601585/
39581828,Tardive seizure after electroconvulsive therapy: Prevalence and associated factors.,L'Encephale,2025,"Lansari R, Souabni K, Ben Nasr Y, Karoui E, Larnaout A, Melki W","Tardive seizure refers to a spontaneous seizure, which occurs after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). It is a rare and poorly understood phenomenon that can lead to other serious consequences such as status epilepticus. Risk factors may be associated, and its management is by no means consensual. However, tardive seizure remains little explored in the absence of feedback and data sharing. The purpose of this study was to report the prevalence of late-onset seizures following ECT during the acute phase of treatment at the stimulation unit of Razi Hospital during its seven years of activity and to identify variables associated with this adverse event.
This is a descriptive and retrospective study that was carried out at the ECT unit of Razi Hospital, Tunisia, based on the medical records of patients treated with ECT between December 2015 and September 2023. Every recorded ECT session during the initial course of treatment with available EEG tracings was included in the study. Maintenance ECT sessions, undocumented sessions, those without clinical observations, and/or those without EEG tracings were all excluded. A tardive seizure was retained according to criteria that included both recorded motor manifestations such as ""motor jerks"" or ""generalized tonic-clonic seizures"" which began spontaneously after ECT and the resumption of a state of consciousness concurrent with an equivocal EEG tracing.
A total of 162 patients received at least one course of ECT during the research period. Ultimately, we included 1931 well documented sessions that were completed for 157 patients in all. Of the 157 patients, seven had experienced at least one late seizure after receiving ECT, accounting for 4.45% of patients. Among the 1931 sessions, 11 late seizures were noted. The prevalence of tardive seizures in our series was 0.57%. Several factors have been associated to the onset of a tardive seizure, including being a male, the presence of a neurological lesion, treatment that lowers the epileptogenic threshold, anesthesia with etomidate, stimulation charge near seizure threshold or maximum electrical load, prolonged induced seizure, and poor post-ictal suppression on the induced seizure tracing.
Despite the dearth of information, tardive seizure following ECT is considered to be a rare event. Risk factor management would be the first action to be taken to prevent such an event.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39581828/

Older age is a strong predictor of delirium. Intraoperative burst suppression on the electroencephalogram (EEG) has also been linked to postoperative delirium and poor neurocognitive outcomes.
In this a secondary analysis of data from the Perioperative Anesthesia Neurocognitive Disorder Assessment-Geriatric (PANDA-G) observational study, the raw EEGs of 239 spine surgery patients were evaluated. Associations between delirium and age, device-generated burst suppression ratio, and visual detection of the raw EEG were compared.
Demographics and anesthesia durations were similar in patients with and without delirium. There was a higher incidence of burst suppression identified by analysis of the raw EEG in the delirium group than in the no delirium group (73.45% vs. 50.9%; P =0.001) which appeared to be driven largely by a higher incidence of burst suppression during maintenance of anesthesia (67.2% vs. 46.3%; P =0.004). Burst suppression was more strongly associated with delirium than with age; estimated linear regression coefficient for burst suppression 0.182 (SE: 0.057; P =0.002) and for age 0.009 (SE: 0.005; P =0.082). There was no significant interaction between burst suppression and age (-0.512; SE: 0.390; P =0.190). Compared with visual detection of burst suppression, the burst suppression ratio overestimated burst suppression at low values, and underestimated burst suppression at high values.
Intraoperative burst suppression identified by visual analysis of the EEG was more strongly associated with delirium than age in older adults undergoing spine surgery. Further research is needed to determine the clinical importance of these findings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39561035/

We analyzed an electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset for sevoflurane anesthesia using two wavelet transform-based mode decomposition methods, comprising the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and wavelet mode decomposition (WMD) methods, and compared the results with those from the previously reported variational mode decomposition (VMD) method.
To acquire the EEG data, we used the software application EEG Analyzer, which enabled the recording of raw EEG signals
When decomposed into six IMFs, the EWT enables narrow band separation of the low-frequency bands IMF-1 to IMF-3, in which all central frequencies are less than 10 Hz. However, in the upper IMF of the high-frequency band, which has a center frequency of ≥ 10 Hz, the dispersion within the frequency band covered was widespread among the individual patients. In WMD, a narrow band of clinical interest is specified using a bandpass filter in a Meyer wavelet filter bank within a specific mode-decomposition discipline. When compared with the VMD and EWT methods, the IMF that was decomposed
The WMD can be used to extract subtle frequency characteristics of EEGs that have been affected by general anesthesia, thus potentially providing better parameters for use in assessing the depth of general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39559333/

The interpretation of ASL-derived perfusion patterns, however, presents challenges. Our study aims to elucidate these perfusion changes in children with LEATs, exploring their correlations with clinical, electroencephalography (EEG), and anatomical MRI findings.
Our cohort included 15 children with LEAT-associated focal lesional epilepsy who underwent single-delay pseudo-continuous ASL imaging; eight were imaged under sedation. We assessed perfusion images both qualitatively and quantitatively, focusing on LEAT-related perfusion changes, as indicated by the asymmetry index (AI) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF).
ASL revealed LEAT-related perfusion changes in all but two patients: 12 LEATs were hypoperfused and one was hyperperfused relative to the contralateral brain parenchyma (CBP). LEATs showed significantly lower perfusion compared to CBP (median: 38.7 vs. 59.1 mL/100 g/min for LEAT and CBP, respectively; p value = 0.004, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney), regardless of sedation. Notably, elevated AI and rCBF values correlated with interictal spikes on EEG (median: -0.008 and 0.84 vs -0.27 and 0.58, respectively), but not to other clinical, EEG, or MRI variables (p value = 0.036, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney).
By highlighting the connection between LEAT and brain perfusion, and by correlating perfusion characteristics and epileptogenicity, our research enhanced our understanding of pediatric epilepsy associated with LEATs. Also, by proving the robustness of these findings to sedation we confirmed the importance of adding ASL to epilepsy protocols to as a valuable tool to supplement anatomical imaging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39531157/

While conventional electroencephalography (EEG) remains the gold standard for diagnosis for nonconvulsive status epilepticus, its implementation in emergency settings can be challenging and time-consuming. We present a case in which simplified EEG with six electrodes enabled rapid detection and monitoring of nonconvulsive status epilepticus in lithium intoxication in the emergency setting.
A 65-year-old woman with stable bipolar disorder presented to our emergency department with impaired consciousness. She had been maintained on lithium carbonate (1600 mg daily) and carbamazepine (400 mg daily) for over 10 years. Following two weeks of nausea and recent onset of agitation and slurred speech, she developed generalized convulsions. Laboratory examinations revealed elevated serum lithium (3.88 mEq/L) and acute renal dysfunction (creatinine 347.5 μmol/L). After resolving initial convulsions, a simplified sixelectrode EEG (Neurofax EEG-1250, Nihon Kohden Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), applied by an emergency physician, demonstrated generalized spike and wave patterns consistent with nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Despite initial seizure control with midazolam during intubation, continuous EEG monitoring revealed recurrent nonconvulsive status epilepticus. After hemodialysis and continued deep sedation, she was discharged on day 40 without neurological sequelae.
This case demonstrates the utility of simplified EEG in emergency settings for early detection and monitoring of nonconvulsive status epilepticus in lithium intoxication. The ability of emergency physicians to apply and interpret simplified EEG enabled timely intervention and prevention of neurological complications. While further research is needed to validate interpretation protocols by non-EEG specialists, simplified EEG shows promise as an accessible tool for rapid assessment of neurotoxicity in lithium intoxication, potentially improving patient outcomes through earlier intervention.
RéSUMé: INTRODUCTION: L'état de mal épileptique non convulsif est une complication grave de l'intoxication au lithium qui nécessite un diagnostic et un traitement rapides. Bien que l'électroencéphalographie (EEG) conventionnelle reste la référence pour le diagnostic de l'état de mal épileptique non convulsif, sa mise en oeuvre dans les situations d'urgence peut être difficile et chronophage. Nous présentons un cas où un EEG simplifié à six électrodes a permis une détection et une surveillance rapides de l'état de mal épileptique non convulsif dans une intoxication au lithium en situation d'urgence. PRéSENTATION DU CAS: Une femme de 65 ans atteinte d'un trouble bipolaire stable s'est présentée à notre service d'urgence avec une altération de la conscience. Elle était sous carbonate de lithium (1600 mg par jour) et carbamazépine (400 mg par jour) depuis plus de 10 ans. Après deux semaines de nausées et l'apparition récente d'agitation et de troubles de la parole, elle a développé des convulsions généralisées. Les examens de laboratoire ont révélé une lithémie élevée (3.88 mEq/L) et une insuffisance rénale aiguë (créatinine 347.5 μmol/L). Après la résolution des convulsions initiales, un EEG simplifié à six électrodes (Neurofax EEG-1250, Nihon Kohden Corporation, Tokyo, Japon), appliqué par un médecin urgentiste, a montré des patterns de pointes-ondes généralisées compatibles avec un état de mal épileptique non convulsif. Malgré le contrôle initial des crises avec le midazolam lors de l'intubation, la surveillance EEG continue a révélé un état de mal épileptique non convulsif récurrent. Après hémodialyse et sedation profonde continue, elle est sortie au jour 40 sans séquelles neurologiques. DISCUSSION: Ce cas démontre l'utilité de l'EEG simplifié en situation d'urgence pour la détection précoce et la surveillance de l'état de mal épileptique non convulsif dans l'intoxication au lithium. La capacité des médecins urgentistes à appliquer et interpréter l'EEG simplifié a permis une intervention rapide et la prévention des complications neurologiques. Bien que des recherches supplémentaires soient nécessaires pour valider les protocoles d'interprétation par des non-spécialistes de l'EEG, l'EEG simplifié s'avère prometteur comme outil accessible pour l'évaluation rapide de la neurotoxicité dans l'intoxication au lithium, permettant potentiellement d'améliorer les résultats pour les patients grâce à une intervention plus précoce.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39495407/

If BS has any independent therapeutic effect on RSE is disputed. We aimed to define EEG characteristics of BS predicting termination or recurrence of status after weaning. All RSE patients treated with IVAT while undergoing continuous EEG monitoring on the neurological intensive care unit between 2014 and 2019 were screened for inclusion. A one hour-period of visually preselected BS-EEG was analyzed. Bursts were segmented by a special thresholding technique and underwent power spectral analysis. Out of 48 enrolled patients, 25 (52.1 %) did not develop seizure recurrence (group Non SE) after weaning from IVAT; in 23 patients (47.9 %), SE reestablished (group SE). In group Non SE, bursts contained higher amounts of EEG delta power (91.59 % vs 80.53 %, p < 0.0001), while faster frequencies were more pronounced in bursts in group SE (theta: 11.38 % vs 5.41 %, p = 0.0008; alpha: 4.89 % vs 1.82 %, p < 0.0001; beta: 3.23 % vs 1.21 %, p = 0.0002). Spectral profiles of individual bursts closely resembled preceding seizure patterns in group SE but not in group Non SE. Accordingly, persistence of spectral composition of initial ictal patterns in bursts, suggests ongoing SE, merely interrupted but not altered by BS. Fast oscillations in bursts indicate a high risk of status recurrence after weaning from IVAT. EEG guided individualized sedation regimes might therefore be superior to standardized anesthesia protocols.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39489997/

This study aimed to evaluate the association between the effect-site concentration of ketamine (CeK) and 2 electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived parameters, the BIS and spectral edge frequency (SEF 95 ), after the administration of a ketamine bolus. Secondary aims included investigating the BIS and SEF 95 variations with time and changes in the surgical pleth index (SPI).
We conducted an observational, prospective, single-center study analyzing intraoperative data from 14 adult female patients undergoing breast oncologic surgery. During stable propofol-remifentanil target-controlled infusion (TCI) anesthesia, a ketamine analgesic bolus was delivered with the target CeK set to 1 μg.mL -1 (Domino model) corresponding to a dose of 0.57 mg.kg -1 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.56-0.57 mg.kg -1 ). Once the CeK reached a value of 1 μg.mL -1 , the target CeK was set to 0 μg.mL -1 . We determined the median BIS, SEF 95 , and SPI trends with time and as a function of the modeled CeK.
BIS and SEF 95 showed no significant change from when ketamine was administered to when CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , but a significant increase was observed at lower CeKs. The maximum BIS was reached at 16.0 minutes [10.2-22.7 minutes] after CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , at CeK=0.22 μg.mL -1 [0.12-0.41 μg.mL -1 ]. The peak SEF 95 value was observed at 10.0 minutes [8.62-14.1 minutes] after CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , at CeK=0.43 μg.mL -1 [0.25-0.50 μg.mL -1 ]. No significant association was found between CeK and the registered SPI values.
Our results show that BIS and SEF 95 , but not SPI, follow a CeK-dependent trend after administering a ketamine bolus. Interestingly, their peak values were not reached at CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , but after several minutes after the drug infusion at CeKs in the 0.2 to 0.5 μg.mL -1 range. This may be explained by the specific pharmacodynamics of ketamine and its varying effects at different concentrations, as well as by the time delay associated with the calculation of the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39485729/

To investigate the potential of EEG-guided individualized anesthetic titration we evaluated the effect of the patient's age on the spectral composition of the EEG during slow propofol induction. Twenty-six young (<65 years) and 25 old (≥65 years) patients received propofol until loss of responsiveness (LOR). After LOR, we switched from a flow rate-based to a target-controlled infusion mode keeping the calculated effect-site concentration at LOR stable. We recorded a frontal EEG and calculated the power spectral density (PSD) and the band powers. For the comparison of the spectral composition of old and young patients, we used an effect size, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The older patients received significantly less propofol (p < 0.001). No patient showed a burst suppression pattern. Whereas the absolute power in all frequency bands decreased significantly with the patient's age, the spectral composition did not change throughout the extended induction period. Slow anesthesia induction may be a suitable approach for geriatric patients to preserve spectral composition patterns typically found in younger brains and to individually identify anesthetic requirements reducing the risk of excessive anesthetic effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39481245/

Cerebral desaturation is considered as one of the factors associated with burst suppression. Our study investigates the association between cerebral desaturation and burst suppression by analyzing their concurrence. Additionally, we aim to examine their association with cardiac surgical phases to identify potential for targeted interventions.
We retrospectively analyzed intraoperative 1-minute interval observations in 51 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Processed EEG and cerebral oximetry were collected, with the anesthesiologists blinded to the information. The associations between cerebral desaturation (defined as a 10% decrease from baseline) and burst suppression, as well as with phase of cardiac surgery, were analyzed using the Generalized Logistic Mixed Effect Model. The results were presented as odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A value of P < .05 was considered statistically significant.
The odds of burst suppression increased 1.5 times with cerebral desaturation (odds ratio [OR], 1.52, 95% CI, 1.11-2.07; P = .009). Compared to precardiopulmonary bypass (pre-CPB), the odds of cerebral desaturation were notably higher during CPB (OR, 22.1, 95% CI, 12.4-39.2; P < .001) and post-CPB (OR, 18.2, 95% CI, 12.2-27.3; P < .001). However, the odds of burst suppression were lower during post-CPB (OR, 0.69, 95% CI, 0.59-0.81; P < .001) compared to pre-CPB. Compared to pre-CPB, the odds of concurrent cerebral desaturation and burst suppression were notably higher during CPB (OR, 52.3, 95% CI, 19.5-140; P < .001) and post-CPB (OR, 12.7, 95% CI, 6.39-25.2; P < .001). During CPB, the odds of cerebral desaturation (OR, 6.59, 95% CI, 3.62-12; P < .001) and concurrent cerebral desaturation and burst suppression (OR, 10, 95% CI, 4.01-25.1; P < .001) were higher in the period between removal of aortic cross-clamp and end of CPB. During the entire surgery, the odds of burst suppression increased 8 times with higher inhalational anesthesia concentration (OR, 7.81, 95% CI, 6.26-9.74; P < .001 per 0.1% increase).
Cerebral desaturation is associated with intraoperative burst suppression during cardiac surgery, most significantly during CPB, especially during the period between the removal of the aortic cross-clamp and end of CPB. Further exploration with simultaneous cerebral oximetry and EEG monitoring is required to determine the causes of burst suppression. Targeted interventions to address cerebral desaturation may assist in mitigating burst suppression and consequently enhance postoperative cognitive function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39446661/

NF targeting the amygdala has drawn attention to therapeutic potential in psychiatry, by potentially harnessing emotion-regulation processes. However, not all individuals respond equally to NF training, possibly owing to varying self-regulation abilities. This underscores the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind successful neuromodulation (i.e. capacity). This study aimed to investigate the establishment and neural correlates of neuromodulation capacity using data from repeated sessions of amygdala electrical fingerprint (Amyg-EFP)-NF and post-training functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-NF sessions. Results from 97 participants (healthy controls and post-traumatic stress disorder and fibromyalgia patients) revealed increased Amyg-EFP neuromodulation capacity over training, associated with post-training amygdala-fMRI modulation capacity and improvements in alexithymia. Individual differenaces in this capacity were associated with pre-training amygdala reactivity and initial neuromodulation success. Additionally, amygdala downregulation during fMRI-NF co-modulated with other regions such as the posterior insula and parahippocampal gyrus. This combined modulation better explained EFP-modulation capacity and improvement in alexithymia than the amygdala modulation alone, suggesting the relevance of this broader network to gained capacity. These findings support a network-based approach for NF and highlight the need to consider individual differences in brain function and modulation capacity to optimize NF interventions.

Here, we investigate offset responses to auditory click trains, examining how they are modulated by inter-click intervals (ICIs) and train duration. Using extracellular recordings and electrocorticography (ECoG) in non-human primates, alongside electroencephalography (EEG) in humans, we show that offset responses are significantly influenced by both ICI and train length, thereby establishing them as markers of temporal integration. We introduce the concept of the 'Neuronal Integrative Window' (NIW), defined as the temporal span during which neurons integrate stimuli to produce or modulate the temporal integration signal. Our data reveal that on the neuronal level, the auditory cortex (AC) exhibits a more expansive NIW than the medial geniculate body (MGB), integrating stimuli over longer durations and showing a preference for larger ICIs. Furthermore, our results indicate that offset responses could serve as potential biomarkers for neurological and psychiatric conditions, highlighted by their sensitivity to pharmacological modulation with ketamine.

This study thus aimed to explore whether pre-anesthesia brain functional network metrics correlate with an individual's sensitivity to propofol.
A total of 54 subjects, including 30 patients and 24 healthy volunteers, were enrolled. Propofol was administered via a target-controlled infusion device, and anesthesia depth was monitored using a bispectral index monitor. Sensitivity to propofol was quantified using the induction time, measured from infusion onset to the bispectral index, which reached 60. Brain functional network metrics indicative of functional integration and segregation, centrality, and network resilience were computed from pre-anesthetic 60-channel EEG recordings. Linear regression analysis and machine learning predictive models were applied to evaluate the contribution of pre-anesthesia network metrics in predicting individual sensitivity to propofol.
Our analysis results revealed that subjects could be categorized into high- or low-sensitivity groups based on their induction time. Individuals with low sensitivity exhibited a greater network degree, clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and betweenness centrality, along with reduced modularity and assortativity coefficient in the alpha band. Furthermore, alpha band network metrics were significantly correlated with individual induction time. Leveraging these network metrics as features enabled the classification of individuals into high- or low-sensitivity groups with an accuracy of 94%.
Using a clinically relevant endpoint that signifies the level of anesthesia suitable for surgical procedures, this study underscored the robust correlation between pre-anesthesia alpha-band network metrics and individual sensitivity to propofol in a cohort that included both patients and healthy volunteers. Our findings offer preliminary insights into the potential utility of pre-anesthetic brain status assessment to predict propofol sensitivity on an individual basis, which may help to develop a more accurate personalized anesthesia plan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39366070/

To confirm the improved safety achieved through EEG guidance for drug administration during procedural sedation.
Following the revision of the departmental protocol, 14 standards were set. Sedation data and outcomes in 150 consecutive patients undergoing fluoroscopic and combined endoscopic procedures were evaluated against these. Combination sedo-analgesia was titrated by the interventional radiology nurses guided by bispectral index sensor (BIS) measurements to achieve readings between 80 and 85. Doses were stratified by patient age and ASA status. Nasal oxygen was given and standard monitoring including pulse oximetry and capnography were used alongside to assess for complications, notably hypoxaemia of ≤ 94%.
85% were non-vascular procedures, the bulk made up of oesophageal stent insertion, gastrostomy, oesophageal dilatation of radiation strictures and biliary procedures. Mean procedure time was 32.9 minutes (10-170). Mean doses of midazolam and fentanyl were 3.99mg (±1.9) and 92.3μg (±35.4), respectively. 84% of patients were classified as having received light or moderate sedation (BIS 70-89). Three standards for patient sedation were missed, but no patient required sedation reversal or airway management, and none developed hypoxaemia.
BIS guidance of sedation administration allows real-time assessment of the patient's response to sedo-analgesia administered and allows prediction about the safety of further drug administration. It identifies patients waking up, allowing this to be anticipated and reduces interruptions of the procedure. It offers clear clinical advantages to interval assessment of patients' response to clinical stimuli and reduces under-as well as oversedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39317529/

Therefore, we look forward to creating a straightforward, precise, and clinically useful prediction model by incorporating new factors, such as frailty and IOH.
We retrospectively collected 540 patients and analyzed the data from 418 patients. Univariate analysis and backward stepwise logistic regression were used to select risk factors to develop a dynamic nomogram model, and then we developed a web calculator to visualize the process of prediction. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility.
According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the nomogram showed good discriminative ability (AUC = 0.933) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test demonstrated the nomogram had good calibration (
Incorporating two distinctive new risk factors, frailty and IOH, we firstly developed a visualized nomogram for accurately predicting BS in non-cardiac surgery patients. The model is expected to guide clinical decision-making and optimize anesthesia management.

In this study, seizure quality was assessed using anesthetic depth measurement with the patient state index (PSI).
A prospective experimental study was conducted with a control group, including a sample of 346 stimulations (PSI=134; Control=212) in 51 patients admitted and diagnosed with major depressive disorders. Seizure adequacy variables (seizure time in electroencephalogram [EEG] and motor activity, visual evaluation of the EEG, ECT-EEG parameter rating scale [EEPRS], seizure concordance, central inhibition, automated parameters, and autonomic activation) were assessed using linear mixed-effects models for continuous variables and generalized linear mixed-effects models for dichotomous variables.
The PSI group required lower stimulation energy. The use of the PSI was associated with longer seizure time, both motor and electroencephalographic, higher quality of the EEG recording, better seizure concordance, and higher values for the automated parameters of maximum sustained coherence and time to peak coherence.
The use of the PSI to measure anesthetic depth may reduce the electrical stimulus charge required and improve seizure quality in ECT modified with propofol.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39313197/
39312635,Changes in Intra- and Cross-hemispheric Directed Functional Connectivity in the Electroencephalographic Signals during Propofol-induced Loss of Consciousness.,Anesthesiology,2025,"Troyas C, Ostertag J, Schneider G, García PS, Sleigh JW, Kreuzer M","Numerous, sometimes conflicting, changes in brain functional connectivity have been associated with the transition from wakefulness to unresponsiveness at induction of general anesthesia. However, relatively few studies have looked at the detailed time evolution of the transition, for different electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands, and in the clinical scenario of surgical patients undergoing general anesthesia.
The authors investigated the changes in the frontal and frontoparietal directed and undirected functional connectivity to multichannel EEG data recorded from 29 adult male surgical patients undergoing propofol-induced loss of consciousness during induction of anesthesia. Directed functional connectivity was estimated using bivariate frequency domain Granger causality, and undirected connectivity was assessed using EEG coherence.
Around the point of loss of consciousness, local frontal, interhemispheric frontal, and frontoparietal feedback and feedforward Granger causality all decreased between 31% and 51.5% in the delta band (median [interquartile range] for local frontal, 0.14 [0.08, 0.27] to 0.08 [0.06, 0.12]; P = 0.02). After a lag of a few minutes, Granger causality markedly increased in the gamma and beta bands for local frontal (0.03 [0.02, 0.07] to 0.09 [0.07, 0.11]; P < 0.001) and long-distance cross-hemispheric frontoparietal feedback (0.02 [0.01, 0.04] to 0.07 [0.04, 0.09]; P < 0.001) and feedforward (0.02 [0.01, 0.04] to 0.03 [0.03, 0.04]; P = 0.01) coupling, but not for within-hemispheric frontoparietal feedback and feedforward. Frontal interhemispheric EEG coherence significantly decreased in the lower frequencies (f < 12 Hz) at loss of consciousness, while no significant increase for the beta and gamma bands was observed.
Propofol-induced loss of consciousness in surgical patients is associated with a global breakdown in low-frequency directed functional connectivity, coupled with a high-frequency increase between closely located brain regions. At loss of consciousness, Granger causality shows more pronounced changes than coherence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39312635/
39312366,A study comparing brain wave patterns of fentanyl and ketamine in adult patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery.,Medicine,2024,"Wang P, Ma G","This study aimed to investigate and compare the neurophysiological impacts of two widely used anesthetic agents, Fentanyl and Ketamine, on EEG power spectra during different stages of anesthesia in adult patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery. EEG data were collected from patients undergoing anesthesia with either Fentanyl or Ketamine. The data were analyzed for relative power spectrum and fast-to-slow wave power ratios, alongside Spectral Edge Frequency 95% (SEF95), at 3 key stages: pre-anesthesia, during stable anesthesia, and post-anesthesia. EEG Relative Power Spectrum: Initially, both groups exhibited similar EEG spectral profiles, establishing a uniform baseline (P > .05). Upon anesthesia induction, the Fentanyl group showed a substantial increase in delta band power (P < .05), suggesting deeper anesthesia, while the Ketamine group maintained higher alpha and beta band activity (P < .05), indicative of a lighter sedative effect. Fast and Slow Wave Power Ratios: The Fentanyl group exhibited a marked reduction in the fast-to-slow wave power ratio during anesthesia (P < .05), persisting post-anesthesia (P < .05) and indicating a lingering effect on brain activity. Conversely, the Ketamine group demonstrated a more stable ratio (P > .05), conducive to settings requiring rapid cognitive recovery. Spectral Edge Frequency 95% (SEF95): Analysis showed a significant decrease in SEF95 values for the Fentanyl group during anesthesia (P < .05), reflecting a shift towards lower frequency power. The Ketamine group experienced a less pronounced decrease (P > .05), maintaining a higher SEF95 value that suggested a lighter level of sedation. The study highlighted the distinct impacts of Fentanyl and Ketamine on EEG power spectra, with Fentanyl inducing deeper anesthesia as evidenced by shifts towards lower frequency activity and a significant decrease in SEF95 values. In contrast, Ketamine's preservation of higher frequency activity and more stable SEF95 values suggests a lighter, more dissociative anesthetic state. These findings emphasize the importance of EEG monitoring in anesthesia for tailoring anesthetic protocols to individual patient needs and optimizing postoperative outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39312366/

We studied 21 children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who achieved seizure control after focal resective surgery. Open-source detectors quantified HFO and spike rates during extraoperative and intraoperative intracranial EEG recordings performed before resection. We determined under which anesthetic conditions HFO and spike rates differentiated the seizure onset zone (SOZ) within the resected area from non-epileptic sites.
We analyzed 925 artifact-free electrodes, including 867 at non-epileptic sites and 58 at SOZ sites. Higher Sevoflurane doses significantly increased HFO and spike rates at non-epileptic sites, exhibiting spatial variability among different detectors. These biomarkers were elevated in the SOZ more than in non-epileptic sites under 2-4 vol% Sevoflurane anesthesia, with Cohen's d effect sizes above 3.0 and Mann-Whitney U-Test r effect sizes above 0.5.
We provided normative atlases of HFO and spike rates under different Sevoflurane anesthesia conditions. Sevoflurane elevates HFO and spike rates preferentially in the epileptogenic zone.
Assessing the relative severity of biomarker levels across sites may be relevant for localizing the epileptogenic zone under Sevoflurane anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39307102/

However, the influence of patient positioning changes, particularly in gynecological surgeries where a head-down position is often required, on the accuracy of these monitoring indices remains unexplored.
The aim of the our study was to observe the impact of patient position changes on the monitoring value of entropy and BIS to identify a more sensitive method of anaesthesia depth monitoring for gynaecological surgery patients.
We conducted a study involving 40 women undergoing general anesthesia, during which routine monitoring of vital signs, including electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR), noninvasive arterial blood pressure (NIBP), oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), and end-expiratory carbon dioxide (PetCO2), was initiated. Entropy and BIS devices were affixed to the patients' foreheads after alcohol sterilization to record brain activity. Tracheal intubation was performed following anesthesia induction. Throughout anesthesia maintenance, the value of BIS and response entropy (RE) were monitored and maintained between 40 and 50 by adjusting the infusion rate of propofol and remifentanil with Target Controlled Infusion (TCI, Mintopharmacokinetics model). Dosing for infusion control utilized corrected weight (height-105). Data were recorded before and after position changes, including tilting the operating table to head-down positions of 15 and 25 degrees, returning to a supine position, and elevating the head to 15 and 25-degree angles. BIS and entropy values at different time points were compared between the groups.
Both BIS and entropy values increased from supine to head-down position and decreased from supine to head-up position, with entropy changes preceding those of BIS. Heart rate increased after head-up and decreased after head-down, while mean blood pressure (MBP) exhibited the opposite effect on heart rate. Significant correlations were found between heart rate and BIS (correlation coefficient: -0.43) and RE (correlation coefficient: -0.416), as well as between MBP and BIS (correlation coefficient: 0.346) and RE (correlation coefficient: 0.384).
Changes in patient position can significantly affect the value of RE and BIS, as changes in entropy occur earlier than changes in the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39302400/

Variational mode decomposition (VMD) enables mathematical optimization methods to decompose EEG signals into natural number intrinsic mode functions with distinct narrow bands. However, the analysis requires the a priori determination of hyperparameters, including the decomposition number (K) and the penalty factor (PF). In the VMD analysis of EEGs derived from a noninterventional and noninvasive retrospective observational study, we adapted the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) to determine the K and PF hyperparameters of the VMD. As a metric for optimization, we calculated the envelope function of the IMF decomposed via the VMD method and used its envelope entropy as the fitness function. The K and PF values varied in each epoch, with one epoch being the analytical unit of EEG; however, the fitness values showed convergence at an early stage in the GWO algorithm. The K value was set to 2 to capture the α wave enhancement observed during the maintenance phase of general anesthesia in intrinsic mode function 2 (IMF-2). This study suggests that using the GWO to optimize VMD hyperparameters enables the construction of a robust analytical model for examining the EEG frequency characteristics involved in the effects of general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39275658/

The CONOX (Fresenius Kabi) calculates two indices, the qCON (hypnotic level) and the qNOX (nociception). The CONOX also calculates indices for electromyographic (EMG) activity and EEG burst suppression (BSR). Because all EEG parameters seem to influence each other, our goal was a detailed description of parameter relationships.
We used qCON, qNOX, EMG, and BSR information from 14 patients receiving propofol anesthesia. We described index relationships with linear models, heat maps, and box plot representations. We also evaluated associations between qCON/qNOX and propofol/remifentanil effect site concentrations (ceP/ceR).
qNOX and qCON (qCON = 0.79*qNOX + 5.8; p < 0.001; R
We could describe relationships between qCON, qNOX, EMG, BSR, ceP, and ceR, which may help the anaesthesiologist better interpret the information provided. One major finding is the dependence of qCON > 80 on EMG activity. This may limit the possibility of detecting wakefulness in the absence of EMG. Further, qNOX seems generally higher than qCON, but high opioid doses may lead to higher qCON than qNOX indices.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39266928/

Due to their low amplitudes it is common practice to average 200 or more sweeps to discern the evoked potentials from the background EEG. The aim of this study was to investigate if an algorithm designed to determine the lowest sweep count needed to obtain reproducible evoked potentials in each patient significantly reduces the median necessary sweep count to under 200. 30 patients undergoing spinal surgery at the Department of Neurosurgery were included in the study. Beginning with a sweep count of 200 an algorithm was designed to determine the lowest sweep count that yielded reproducible evoked potentials in each patient. By this algorithm the minimal sweep count was determined in 15 patients for mSEPs and in 15 patients for tSEPs. The required sweep count was below 200 in 14 of 15 patients for mSEPs (93.3%) with a mean sweep count of 56 ± 51. For tSEPs the sweep count was below 200 in 11 of 15 patients (73.3%) with a mean sweep count of 106 ± 70 (mean ± SD). The calculated mean time to average the potentials could thereby be reduced from 48.8s to 13.7s for mSEPs and from 48.8s to 25.9s for tSEPs. The proposed algorithm allowed sweep count and acquisition time reduction in roughly 90% of all patients for mSEPs and in 70% of all patients for tSEPs.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39261395/

We investigated whether pBICs are good indicators for adequacy of analgesia during surgery.
After local ethical committee approval, we enrolled 50 patients (27-65 years, ASA-PS I or II) who were scheduled elective surgery. Besides standard anesthesia monitors, to assess pBICs, we used a BIS monitor and freeware Bispectrum Analyzer for A2000. Fentanyl 5 µg/kg was completely administered before incision, and anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. After skin incision, when the peak of pBIC-high or pBIC-low decreased by 10% in absolute value (named LT10-high and LT10-low groups in order) or when either peak decreased to below 20% (BL20-high and BL20-low groups), an additional 1 g/kg of fentanyl was administered to examine its effect on the peak that showed a decrease.
The mean values and standard deviation for pBIC-high 5 min before fentanyl administration, at the time of fentanyl administration, and 5 min after fentanyl administration for LT10-high group were 39.8% (10.9%), 26.9% (10.5%), and 35.7% (12.5%).

It presents a policy validated by the members of JSIVA-WG and a review committee for practical anesthesia management. Anesthesiologists should acquire and maintain the necessary knowledge and skills to be able to administer TIVA properly. A secure venous access is critically important for TIVA. To visualize and understand the pharmacokinetics of intravenous anesthetics, use of real-time pharmacokinetic simulations is strongly recommended. Syringe pumps are essential for the infusion of intravenous anesthetics, which should be prepared according to the rules of each individual anesthesia department, particularly with regard to dilution. Syringes should be clearly labeled with content and drug concentration. When managing TIVA, particularly with the use of muscle relaxants, monitoring processed electroencephalogram (EEG) is advisable. However, the depth of sedation/anesthesia must be assessed comprehensively using various parameters, rather than simply relying on a single EEG index. TIVA should be swiftly changed to an alternative method that includes inhalation anesthesia if necessary. Use of antagonists at emergence may be associated with re-sedation risk. Casual administration of antagonists and sending patients back to surgical wards without careful observation are not acceptable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39217587/

In this single-center retrospective analysis at a university hospital, the electronic patient records of 38,628 patients (≥18 years) receiving general anesthesia between January 2016 and December 2018 were analyzed. Risk factors for burst suppression were evaluated using univariate and multivariable analysis. We measured the incidence of burst suppression as indicated by the burst suppression ratio (BSR) of the Entropy Module, the maximum and mean BSR values, relative burst suppression duration, mean volatile anesthetic concentrations, and mean age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentrations (aaMAC) at burst suppression, and cases of potentially misclassified burst suppression episodes. Analyses were done separately for the total anesthesia period, as well as for the Induction and Maintenance phase. The association with age was evaluated using linear and polynomial fits and by calculating correlation coefficients.
Of the 54,266 patients analyzed, 38,628 were included, and 19,079 patients exhibited episodes with BSR >0. Patients with BSR >0 were significantly older, and age had the highest predictive power for BSR >0 (area under the receiving operating characteristic [AUROC] = 0.646 [0.638-0.654]) compared to other patient or procedural factors. The probability of BSR >0 increased linearly with patient age (ρ = 0.96-0.99) between 1.9% and 9.8% per year. While maximal and mean BSR showed a nonlinear relationship with age, relative burst suppression duration also increased linearly during maintenance (ρ = 0.83). Further, episodes potentially indicating burst suppression that were not detected by the Entropy BSR algorithm also became more frequent with age. Volatile anesthetic concentrations sufficient to induce BSR >0 were negatively correlated with age (sevoflurane: ρ = -0.71), but remained close to an aaMAC of 1.0.
The probability of burst suppression during general anesthesia increases linearly with age in adult patients, while lower anesthetic concentrations induce burst suppression with increasing patient age. Simultaneously, algorithm-based burst suppression detection appears to perform worse in older patients. These findings highlight the necessity to further enhance EEG application and surveillance strategies in anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39178156/

However, this performance might be hindered by lack of effective effort on the one hand, and by too much stress on the other hand. Despite their known impact, there are currently no effective tools for measuring cognitive effort or stress effect during cognitive assessment. We developed real-time electrophysiological markers for cognitive effort and for stress effect, which could be used during cognitive assessment.
We assessed these markers during the use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) before and after cardiac surgery, which is known to involve cognitive decline in up to 30%-50% of elderly patients.
The major findings of the study, for the largest group of patients, with preoperative MoCA in the intermediate range, were that the decline is significantly associated (1) with higher preoperative cognitive effort and (2) with higher postoperative stress effect during the test.
These findings, as well as preliminary additional ones, suggest a potential importance for monitoring cognitive effort and stress effect during assessment in general, and specifically during perioperative assessment.

39142623,Chaotic nature of the electroencephalogram during shallow and deep anesthesia: From analysis of the Lyapunov exponent.,Neuroscience,2024,Hayashi K,"In conscious states, the electrodynamics of the cortex are reported to work near a critical point or phase transition of chaotic dynamics, known as the edge-of-chaos, representing a boundary between stability and chaos. Transitions away from this boundary disrupt cortical information processing and induce a loss of consciousness. The entropy of the electroencephalogram (EEG) is known to decrease as the level of anesthesia deepens. However, whether the chaotic dynamics of electroencephalographic activity shift from this boundary to the side of stability or the side of chaotic enhancement during anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness remains poorly understood. We investigated the chaotic properties of EEGs at two different depths of clinical anesthesia using the maximum Lyapunov exponent, which is mathematically regarded as a formal measure of chaotic nature, using the Rosenstein algorithm. In 14 adult patients, 12 s of electroencephalographic signals were selected during two depths of clinical anesthesia (sevoflurane concentration 2% as relatively deep anesthesia, sevoflurane concentration 0.6% as relatively shallow anesthesia). Lyapunov exponents, correlation dimensions and approximate entropy were calculated from these electroencephalographic signals. As a result, maximum Lyapunov exponent was generally positive during sevoflurane anesthesia, and both maximum Lyapunov exponents and correlation dimensions were significantly greater during deep anesthesia than during shallow anesthesia despite reductions in approximate entropy. The chaotic nature of the EEG might be increased at clinically deeper inhalational anesthesia, despite the decrease in randomness as reflected in the decreased entropy, suggesting a shift to the side of chaotic enhancement under anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39142623/

The patient was participating in an extended open-label trial of aducanumab when she was admitted to hospital for focal seizures and ARIA in 2 noncontiguous regions of the left frontal and occipital lobes. Despite aggressive treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, sedation, and antiseizure medications, she died from refractory focal status epilepticus. In retrospect, routine surveillance brain magnetic resonance imaging performed 11 weeks before hospitalization had signs of ARIA, which had not been identified.
Clinicians should be aware that anti-amyloid therapies may cause rare serious adverse events. A high degree of vigilance is required in the interpretation of surveillance imaging for ARIA. Longitudinal studies are justified to further characterize the safety profile of anti-amyloid antibody therapies and identify participants at high risk of serious adverse events.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39121445/
39116153,Predicting treatment response to ketamine in treatment-resistant depression using auditory mismatch negativity: Study protocol.,PloS one,2024,"Martin J, Gholamali Nezhad F, Rueda A, Lee GH, Charlton CE, Soltanzadeh M, Ladha KS, Krishnan S, Diaconescu AO, Bhat V","Ketamine has recently attracted considerable attention for its rapid effects on patients with major depressive disorder, including treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Despite ketamine's promising results in treating depression, a significant number of patients do not respond to the treatment, and predicting who will benefit remains a challenge. Although its antidepressant effects are known to be linked to its action as an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, the precise mechanisms that determine why some patients respond and others do not are still unclear.
This study aims to understand the computational mechanisms underlying changes in the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) response following treatment with intravenous ketamine. Moreover, we aim to link the computational mechanisms to their underlying neural causes and use the parameters of the neurocomputational model to make individual treatment predictions.
This is a prospective study of 30 patients with TRD who are undergoing intravenous ketamine therapy. Prior to 3 out of 4 ketamine infusions, EEG will be recorded while patients complete the auditory MMN task. Depression, suicidality, and anxiety will be assessed throughout the study and a week after the last ketamine infusion. To translate the effects of ketamine on the MMN to computational mechanisms, we will model changes in the auditory MMN using the hierarchical Gaussian filter, a hierarchical Bayesian model. Furthermore, we will employ a conductance-based neural mass model of the electrophysiological data to link these computational mechanisms to their neural causes.
The findings of this study may improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying response and resistance to ketamine treatment in patients with TRD. The parameters obtained from fitting computational models to EEG recordings may facilitate single-patient treatment predictions, which could provide clinically useful prognostic information.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of low-dose ketamine on processed electroencephalography (EEG) signals during anesthesia.
Forty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II undergoing elective gynecological surgery were enrolled. EEG monitoring was initiated upon induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane and alfentanil immediately after induction. Fifteen minutes after induction, the ketamine group received a 0.3 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.05 mg/kg/h infusion until completion of surgery. The control group received equivalent saline. Postoperative assessments included pain score (visual analog scale), morphine usage, and quality of recovery.
The ketamine group had significantly higher Patient State Index (PSi) values at 10, 20, and 30 minutes after ketamine administration compared to the controls. Ketamine administration led to significant alterations in EEG patterns, including reduced relative power in delta and theta frequency bands, and increased relative power in beta and gamma frequency bands at 10 minutes post-administration. Relative power in the alpha frequency band significantly decreased at 10, 20, and 30 minutes post-administration. However, there were no differences in intraoperative alfentanil consumption, postoperative morphine usage, and pain scores between the two groups.
Low-dose ketamine administration during desflurane anesthesia led to notable changes in EEG patterns and PSi values. These findings provide valuable insights into the impact of ketamine on brain activity, and offer essential information for clinical anesthesiologists.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39107901/

Here, we investigate dynamical properties of the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) of healthy subjects undergoing general anesthesia with propofol, xenon or ketamine. Importantly, all participants were unresponsive under anesthesia, while consciousness was retained only during ketamine anesthesia (in the form of vivid dreams), enabling an experimental dissociation between unresponsiveness and unconsciousness. For each condition, we measure (i) avalanche criticality, (ii) chaoticity, and (iii) criticality-related metrics, revealing that states of unconsciousness are characterized by a distancing from both avalanche criticality and the edge of chaos. We then ask whether these same dynamical properties are predictive of the perturbational complexity index (PCI), a TMS-based measure that has shown remarkably high sensitivity in detecting consciousness independently of behavior. We successfully predict individual subjects' PCI values with considerably high accuracy from resting-state EEG dynamical properties alone. Our results establish a firm link between perturbational complexity and criticality, and provide further evidence that criticality is a necessary condition for the emergence of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39103539/
39093724,Electroencephalogram-Based Anesthesia Indices Differently React to Modulations of Alpha-Oscillatory Activity.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2025,"Kinateder T, Kratzer S, Husemann C, Hautmann H, García PS, Schneider G, Kreuzer M","The electroencephalographic (EEG) provides the anesthesiologist with information regarding the level of anesthesia. Processed EEG indices are available that reflect the level of anesthesia as a single number. Strong oscillatory EEG activity in the alpha-band may be associated with an adequate level of anesthesia and a lower incidence of cognitive sequelae. So far, we do not know how the processed indices would react to changes in the alpha-band activity. Hence, we modulated the alpha-oscillatory activity of intraoperative EEG to assess possible index changes.
We performed our analyses based on data from 2 studies. Intraoperative EEG was extracted, and we isolated the alpha-band activity by band-pass filtering (8-12 Hz). We added or subtracted this activity to the original EEG in different steps with different amplifications of the alpha signal. We then replayed these signals to the bispectral index (BIS), the Entropy Module (state entropy [SE]), the CONOX (qCON), and the SEDLine (patient state index [PSI]); and evaluated the alpha-band modulation's impact on the respective index.
The indices behaved differently to the modulation. In general, indices decreased with stronger alpha-band activity, but the rate of change was different with SE showing the strongest change (9% per step) and PSI and BIS ( < 5% per step) showing the weakest change. A simple regression analysis revealed a decrease of 0.02 to 0.09 index points with increasing alpha amplification.
While the alpha-band in the intraoperative EEG seems to carry information regarding the quality of anesthesia, changes in the alpha-band activity do neither strongly nor uniformly influence processed EEG indices. Hence, to assess alpha-oscillatory activity's strength, the user needs to focus on the raw EEG or its spectral representation also displayed on the monitoring systems.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39093724/

In the last several decades, there has been an increased interest in exploring tools that easily allow the early recognition of patients at risk of developing POD. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a widely available tool used to understand delirium pathophysiology, and its use in the perioperative setting has grown exponentially, particularly to predict and detect POD. We performed a systematic review to investigate the use of EEG in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative settings. We identified 371 studies, and 56 met the inclusion criteria. A range of techniques was used to obtain EEG data, from limited 1-4 channel setups to complex 256-channel systems. Power spectra were often measured preoperatively, yet the outcomes were inconsistent. During surgery, the emphasis was primarily on burst suppression (BS) metrics and power spectra, with a link between the frequency and timing of BS, and POD. The EEG patterns observed in POD aligned with those noted in delirium in different contexts, suggesting a reduction in EEG activity. Further research is required to investigate preoperative EEG indicators that may predict susceptibility to delirium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39088366/
39082130,Understanding time to peak effect of propofol as sole agent on bispectral index in children aged 2-12 years.,Paediatric anaesthesia,2024,"Gavel G, Koch G, Terrier A, Atkinson A, Pfister M, Erb T","The pharmacodynamics of propofol in children have previously been described with the proprietary bispectral index (BIS) as an effect-site marker, and it has been suggested that the rate of onset of propofol might be age dependent, that is, a shorter time to peak effect in younger children. However, these analyses were potentially confounded by co-administered drugs, in particular opioids and benzodiazepines. Thus, the goal of this prospective study was to characterize the influence of age and weight on the onset of hypnotic effects from propofol, reflected by the time to peak of propofol effect-site concentration in the absence of additional drugs.
A total of 46 healthy children aged 2-12 years presenting for elective surgery were included in our observational cohort study. Solely propofol was administered via a target-controlled infusion pump programmed with the Paedfusor pharmacokinetic model. The BIS and infusion pump data were recorded. The effect of an induction ""bolus"" was recorded having stopped the pump once a propofol plasma target concentration of 7 μg.mL
Time to peak of propofol effect-site concentration had a difference (p-value <.01) for age and weight, that is 84 [74, 96] (median [IQR] secs for children aged 2-6 years vs. 99 [91, 113] secs for children aged 8-12 years and 82 [71, 95] secs for weight 11-25 kg vs. 99 [91, 114] secs for weight 30-63 kg). The plasma effect-site equilibration rate constant for propofol had a heterogeneous distribution with a median of 2.36 (IQR: 2.05-2.93; range: 0.83-7.31) per minute but showed a weight-dependent effect in patients with weight below 45 kg.
In children, the age and weight have an influence on time to peak effect of propofol. In the absence of opioids and benzodiazepines, time to peak effect was approximately 20% longer in children aged 8-12 years as compared to younger children. Such clinically relevant age and weight effects are an important consideration in the individualized titration of propofol dosing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39082130/

Undesirable dissociative side effects and misuse potential limit expanded use of ketamine in several mental health disorders despite promising clinical activity and intensifying medical need. (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine (RR-HNK) is a metabolite of ketamine that lacks anesthetic and dissociative activity but maintains antidepressant and analgesic activity in multiple preclinical models. To enable future assessments in selected human indications, we report the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of RR-HNK in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (NCT04711005). A six-level single-ascending dose (SAD) (0.1-4 mg/kg) and a two-level multiple ascending dose (MAD) (1 and 2 mg/kg) study was performed using a 40-minute IV administration emulating the common practice for ketamine administration for depression. Safety assessments showed RR-HNK possessed a minimal adverse event profile and no serious adverse events at all doses examined. Evaluations of dissociation and sedation demonstrated that RR-HNK did not possess anesthetic or dissociative characteristics in the doses examined. RR-HNK PK parameters were measured in both the SAD and MAD studies and exhibited dose-proportional increases in exposure. Quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) measurements collected as a PD parameter based on preclinical findings and ketamine's established effect on gamma-power oscillations demonstrated increases of gamma power in some participants at the lower/mid-range doses examined. Cerebrospinal fluid examination confirmed RR-HNK exposure within the central nervous system (CNS).

39033791,Meso-scale reorganization of local-global brain networks under mild sedation of propofol anesthesia.,NeuroImage,2024,"Dong K, Zhang L, Zhong Y, Xu T, Zhao Y, Chen S, Mahmoud SS, Fang Q","The fragmentation of the functional brain network has been identified through the functional connectivity (FC) analysis in studies investigating anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness (LOC). However, it remains unclear whether mild sedation of anesthesia can cause similar effects. This paper aims to explore the changes in local-global brain network topology during mild anesthesia, to better understand the macroscopic neural mechanism underlying anesthesia sedation. We analyzed high-density EEG from 20 participants undergoing mild and moderate sedation of propofol anesthesia. By employing a local-global brain parcellation in EEG source analysis, we established binary functional brain networks for each participant. Furthermore, we investigated the global-scale properties of brain networks by estimating global efficiency and modularity, and examined the changes in meso-scale properties of brain networks by quantifying the distribution of high-degree and high-betweenness hubs and their corresponding rich-club coefficients. It is evident from the results that the mild sedation of anesthesia does not cause a significant change in the global-scale properties of brain networks. However, network components centered on SomMot L show a significant decrease, while those centered on Default L, Vis L and Limbic L exhibit a significant increase during the transition from wakefulness to mild sedation (p<0.05). Compared to the baseline state, mild sedation almost doubled the number of high-degree hubs in Vis L, DorsAttn L, Limbic L, Cont L, and reduced by half the number of high-degree hubs in SomMot R, DorsAttn R, SalVentAttn R. Further, mild sedation almost doubled the number of high-betweenness hubs in Vis L, Vis R, Limbic R, Cont R, and reduced by half the number of high-betweenness hubs in SomMot L, SalVentAttn L, Default L, and SomMot R. Our results indicate that mild anesthesia cannot affect the global integration and segregation of brain networks, but influence meso-scale function for integrating different resting-state systems involved in various segregation processes. Our findings suggest that the meso-scale brain network reorganization, situated between global integration and local segregation, could reflect the autonomic compensation of the brain for drug effects. As a direct response and adjustment of the brain network system to drug administration, this spontaneous reorganization of the brain network aims at maintaining consciousness in the case of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39033791/

Beyond the primary role of EEG in detecting seizures, this review explores its utility in neuroprognostication, monitoring neurological deterioration, assessing treatment responses, and aiding rehabilitation in patients with encephalopathy, coma, or other consciousness disorders. Most seizures and status epilepticus (SE) events in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting are nonconvulsive or subtle, making cEEG essential for identifying these otherwise silent events. Imaging and invasive approaches can add to the diagnosis of seizures for specific populations, given that scalp electrodes may fail to identify seizures that may be detected by depth electrodes or electroradiologic findings. When cEEG identifies SE, the risk of secondary neuronal injury related to the time-intensity ""burden"" often prompts treatment with anti-seizure medications. Similarly, treatment may be administered for seizure-spectrum activity, such as periodic discharges or lateralized rhythmic delta slowing on the ictal-interictal continuum (IIC), even when frank seizures are not evident on the scalp. In this setting, cEEG is utilized empirically to monitor treatment response. Separately, cEEG has other versatile uses for neurotelemetry, including identifying the level of sedation or consciousness. Specific conditions such as sepsis, traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest may each be associated with a unique application of cEEG; for example, predicting impending events of delayed cerebral ischemia, a feared complication in the first two weeks after subarachnoid hemorrhage. After brief training, non-neurophysiologists can learn to interpret quantitative EEG trends that summarize elements of EEG activity, enhancing clinical responsiveness in collaboration with clinical neurophysiologists. Intensivists and other healthcare professionals also play crucial roles in facilitating timely cEEG setup, preventing electrode-related skin injuries, and maintaining patient mobility during monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39014421/

This non-blinded cross-sectional study recorded intraoperative HRV, Narcotrend Index, and MAC in 31 male patients during radical prostatectomy using the Da-Vinci robotic-assisted surgical system at Mannheim University Medical Center. The degree of concordance was calculated using repeated measures correlation with the R package (rmcorr) and presented using the rmcorr coefficient (rrm). The Narcotrend Index correlates significantly across all measures with the time-dependent parameter of HRV, the standard deviation of the means of RR intervals (SDNN) (rrm = 0.2; p < 0.001), the frequency-dependent parameters low frequency (LF) (rrm = 0.09; p = 0.04) and the low frequency/high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio) (rrm = 0.11; p = 0.002). MAC correlated significantly negatively with the time-dependent parameter of heart rate variability, SDNN (rrm = -0.28; p < 0.001), the frequency-dependent parameter LF (rrm = -0.06; p < 0.001) and the LF/HF ratio (rrm = -0.18; p < 0.001) and the Narcotrend Index (rrm = -0.49; p < 0.001) across all measures. HRV mirrors the trend of the Narcotrend Index used to monitor depth of hypnosis and the inhibitory influence of the anesthetic sevoflurane on the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, HRV can provide essential information about the homeostasis of the autonomic nervous system during general anesthesia.

The clinical implications of similar electrographic patterns being reported as RHADS versus EDB are important to highlight. We aim to review the electrographic characteristics of RHADS, evaluate whether RHADS is seen in other neurological disorders, and identify the similar and unique characteristics between RHADS and EDB to ultimately determine the most accurate way to differentiate and report these patterns. We believe that the differentiation of RHADS and EDB is important as there is a vast difference in the diagnostic approach and the medical management of associated underlying etiologies.

The intervention includes a 20 min 10 Hz tACS at 1 mA intensity or a sham session over parieto-occipital cortical sites, repeated over five consecutive days. The current's frequency targets alpha brain oscillations (8-13 Hz), known to be associated with consciousness. Resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) will be recorded four times daily for five consecutive days: pre and post-intervention, at 60 and 120 min post-tACS.

Here, periodic EEG power features and aperiodic components were examined from longitudinal EEGs collected from 592 healthy 2-44 month-old infants, revealing age-dependent nonlinear changes suggestive of distinct milestones in early brain maturation. Developmental changes in periodic peaks include (1) the presence and then absence of a 9-10 Hz alpha peak between 2-6 months, (2) nonlinear changes in high beta peaks (20-30 Hz) between 4-18 months, and (3) the emergence of a low beta peak (12-20 Hz) in some infants after six months of age. We hypothesized that the emergence of the low beta peak may reflect maturation of thalamocortical network development. Infant anesthesia studies observe that GABA-modulating anesthetics do not induce thalamocortical mediated frontal alpha coherence until 10-12 months of age. Using a small cohort of infants (n = 23) with EEG before and during GABA-modulating anesthesia, we provide preliminary evidence that infants with a low beta peak have higher anesthesia-induced alpha coherence compared to those without a low beta peak.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38987558/

However, the extent to which DMN connectivity can discriminate DoC states-unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS)-is less evident. Particularly, it is unclear whether effective DMN connectivity, as measured indirectly with dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of resting EEG can disentangle UWS from healthy controls and from patients considered conscious (MCS+). Crucially, this extends to UWS patients with potentially ""covert"" awareness (minimally conscious star, MCS*) indexed by voluntary brain activity in conjunction with partially preserved frontoparietal metabolism as measured with positron emission tomography (PET+ diagnosis; in contrast to PET- diagnosis with complete frontoparietal hypometabolism). Here, we address this gap by using DCM of EEG data acquired from patients with traumatic brain injury in 11 UWS (6 PET- and 5 PET+) and in 12 MCS+ (11 PET+ and 1 PET-), alongside with 11 healthy controls. We provide evidence for a key difference in left frontoparietal connectivity when contrasting UWS PET- with MCS+ patients and healthy controls. Next, in a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, we tested the classification performance of the DCM models demonstrating that connectivity between medial prefrontal and left parietal sources reliably discriminates UWS PET- from MCS+ patients and controls. Finally, we illustrate that these models generalize to an unseen dataset: models trained to discriminate UWS PET- from MCS+ and controls, classify MCS* patients as conscious subjects with high posterior probability (pp > .92). These results identify specific alterations in the DMN after severe brain injury and highlight the clinical utility of EEG-based effective connectivity for identifying patients with potential covert awareness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38968195/
38956665,Performance of the MRI lesion pattern score in predicting neurological outcome after out of hospital cardiac arrest: a retrospective cohort analysis.,"Critical care (London, England)",2024,"Iten M, Moser A, Wagner F, Haenggi M","Despite advances in resuscitation practice, patient survival following cardiac arrest remains poor. The utilization of MRI in neurological outcome prognostication post-cardiac arrest is growing and various classifications has been proposed; however a consensus has yet to be established. MRI, though valuable, is resource-intensive, time-consuming, costly, and not universally available. This study aims to validate a MRI lesion pattern score in a cohort of out of hospital cardiac arrest patients at a tertiary referral hospital in Switzerland.
This cohort study spanned twelve months from February 2021 to January 2022, encompassing all unconscious patients aged ≥ 18 years who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of any cause and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Inselspital, University Hospital Bern, Switzerland. We included patients who underwent the neuroprognostication process, assessing the performance and validation of a MRI scoring system.
Over the twelve-month period, 137 patients were admitted to the ICU, with 52 entering the neuroprognostication process and 47 undergoing MRI analysis. Among the 35 MRIs indicating severe hypoxic brain injury, 33 patients (94%) experienced an unfavourable outcome (UO), while ten (83%) of the twelve patients with no or minimal MRI lesions had a favourable outcome. This yielded a sensitivity of 0.94 and specificity of 0.83 for predicting UO with the proposed MRI scoring system. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 5.53 and 0.07, respectively, resulting in an accuracy of 91.49%.
We demonstrated the effectiveness of the MLP scoring scheme in predicting neurological outcome in patients following cardiac arrest. However, to ensure a comprehensive neuroprognostication, MRI results need to be combined with other assessments. While neuroimaging is a promising objective tool for neuroprognostication, given the absence of sedation-related confounders-compared to electroencephalogram (EEG) and clinical examination-the current lack of a validated scoring system necessitates further studies. Incorporating standardized MRI techniques and grading systems is crucial for advancing the reliability of neuroimaging for neuroprognostication.

A machine learning framework to identify biological sleep promoting sedatives using electroencephalogram.,PloS one,2024,"Ramaswamy SM, Kuizenga MH, Weerink MAS, Vereecke HEM, Nagaraj SB, Struys MMRF","Sedatives are commonly used to promote sleep in intensive care unit patients. However, it is not clear whether sedation-induced states are similar to the biological sleep. We explored if sedative-induced states resemble biological sleep using multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings.
Multichannel EEG datasets from two different sources were used in this study: (1) sedation dataset consisting of 102 healthy volunteers receiving propofol (N = 36), sevoflurane (N = 36), or dexmedetomidine (N = 30), and (2) publicly available sleep EEG dataset (N = 994). Forty-four quantitative time, frequency and entropy features were extracted from EEG recordings and were used to train the machine learning algorithms on sleep dataset to predict sleep stages in the sedation dataset. The predicted sleep states were then compared with the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/ Sedation (MOAA/S) scores.
The performance of the model was poor (AUC = 0.55-0.58) in differentiating sleep stages during propofol and sevoflurane sedation. In the case of dexmedetomidine, the AUC of the model increased in a sedation-dependent manner with NREM stages 2 and 3 highly correlating with deep sedation state reaching an AUC of 0.80.
We addressed an important clinical question to identify biological sleep promoting sedatives using EEG signals. We demonstrate that propofol and sevoflurane do not promote EEG patterns resembling natural sleep while dexmedetomidine promotes states resembling NREM stages 2 and 3 sleep, based on current sleep staging standards.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38954679/

We hypothesized that fatigue after COVID-19 would be associated with altered cortical activity in premotor and motor regions.
We used transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with EEG (TMS-EEG) to explore the neural oscillatory activity of the left primary motor area (l-M1) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in a group of sixteen post-COVID patients complaining of lingering fatigue as compared to a sample of age-matched healthy controls. Perceived fatigue was assessed with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Fatigue Rating Scale (FRS).
Post-COVID patients showed a remarkable reduction of beta frequency in both areas. Correlation analysis exploring linear relation between neurophysiological and clinical measures revealed a significant inverse correlation between the individual level of beta oscillations evoked by TMS of SMA with the individual scores in the FRS (r(15) = -0.596; p = 0.012).
Post-COVID fatigue is associated with a reduction of TMS-evoked beta oscillatory activity in SMA.

Can BIS-guided deep sedation (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale [RASS] score, -4 or -5) reduce sedative dosage and increase delirium-free and coma-free (DFCF) days?
A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary mixed ICU, enrolling patients requiring deep sedation for > 8 h. Patients were assigned randomly to either the clinical assessment (CA) or BIS groups (BIS range, 40-60). Both groups used a BIS sensor, whereas the CA group's screen remained covered. After deep sedation, BIS sensors were removed, and delirium was assessed twice daily by researchers masked to the randomization. The primary outcome was the number of DFCF days within 14 days after deep sedation. Additionally, we compared doses of sedative drugs and BIS values during deep sedation.
Ninety-nine patients were included in the study. We found no significant difference in DFCF days (P = .1) between CA and BIS arms, but propofol doses were significantly lower in the BIS group (CA group, 1.77 mg/kg/h [95% CI, 1.60-1.93] vs BIS group, 1.44 mg/kg/h [95% CI, 1.04-1.83]; P = .03). During deep sedation, the CA group spent 46% of the total hours (95% CI, 35%-57%) with BIS values of < 40, whereas the BIS group spent 32% (95% CI, 25%-40%; P = .03). Subgroup analysis focusing on patients sedated for > 24 h revealed an increase in DFCF days in the BIS group (CA group: median, 1 day [interquartile range, 0-9 days] vs BIS group: median, 8 days [interquartile range, 0-13 days]; P = .04).
In this study, BIS-guided deep sedation did not improve DFCF days, but did reduce sedative drug use. In patients requiring sedation for > 24 h, it showed an improvement in DFCF days.

All the surgical cases performed under General Anesthesia at 24 daily locations were prospectively inspected during 15 consecutive working days in March 2023. The use or absence of a processed EEG monitor was registered. Of 379 surgical cases distributed by 24 locations under General Anesthesia, 233 cases (61%) had processed EEG monitoring. The specialty with the highest use of EEG monitoring was Cardiothoracic Surgery, with 100% of cases, followed by interventional Cardiology (90%) and Vascular Surgery (75%). Otorhinolaryngology (29%), Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (25%), and Interventional Pulmonology (20%) were the areas with the lowest use of EEG monitoring. Of note, in the Neuroradiology suite, no processed EEG monitor was used in cases under General Anesthesia.

Despite efforts toward standardization, including the establishment of terminology for critical care EEG in 2012, the processes of testing and interpreting EEG-R remain inconsistent.
A review was conducted on PubMed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Inclusion criteria consisted of articles published between January 2012, and November 2022, testing EEG-R on adult intensive care unit patients. Exclusion criteria included articles focused on highly specialized stimulation equipment or animal, basic science, or small case report studies. The Quality In Prognostic Studies tool was used to assess risk of bias.
One hundred and five articles were identified, with 26 variables collected for each. EEG-R testing varied greatly, including the number of stimuli (range: 1-8; 26 total described), stimulus length (range: 2-30 seconds), length between stimuli (range: 10 seconds-5 minutes), frequency of stimulus application (range: 1-9), frequency of EEG-R testing (range: 1-3 times daily), EEG electrodes (range: 4-64), personnel testing EEG-R (range: neurophysiologists to nonexperts), and sedation protocols (range: discontinuing all sedation to no attempt). EEG-R interpretation widely varied, including EEG-R definitions and grading scales, personnel interpreting EEG-R (range: EEG specialists to nonneurologists), use of quantitative methods, EEG filters, and time to detect EEG-R poststimulation (range: 1-30 seconds).

Remimazolam, propofol, and etomidate were used for 93, 138, and 174 ECT sessions, respectively. The primary outcome was durations of motor and electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure activity, whereas secondary outcomes included hemodynamics (ie, mean arterial pressure [MAP] and heart rate [HR] at various time points from induction to postanesthesia care unit [PACU] discharge), antihypertensive drugs administration after electrical stimulus, and recovery profiles (ie, length of PACU stay and incidence of postictal confusion).
Durations of motor and EEG seizures were shorter for remimazolam than etomidate (motor, P < 0.001; EEG, P = 0.003) but similar compared with propofol (motor, P = 0.191; EEG, P = 0.850). During seizure, remimazolam showed a comparable MAP and HR to etomidate (MAP: P = 0.806; HR: P = 0.116).

To assess whether EEG-guided anesthesia decreases the incidence of delirium after cardiac surgery.
Randomized, parallel-group clinical trial of 1140 adults 60 years or older undergoing cardiac surgery at 4 Canadian hospitals. Recruitment was from December 2016 to February 2022, with follow-up until February 2023.
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by hospital) to receive EEG-guided anesthesia (n = 567) or usual care (n = 573). Patients and those assessing outcomes were blinded to group assignment.
The primary outcome was delirium during postoperative days 1 through 5. Intraoperative measures included anesthetic concentration and EEG suppression time. Secondary outcomes included intensive care and hospital length of stay. Serious adverse events included intraoperative awareness, medical complications, and 30-day mortality.
Of 1140 randomized patients (median [IQR] age, 70 [65-75] years; 282 [24.7%] women), 1131 (99.2%) were assessed for the primary outcome. Delirium during postoperative days 1 to 5 occurred in 102 of 562 patients (18.15%) in the EEG-guided group and 103 of 569 patients (18.10%) in the usual care group (difference, 0.05% [95% CI, -4.57% to 4.67%]). In the EEG-guided group compared with the usual care group, the median volatile anesthetic minimum alveolar concentration was 0.14 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.13) lower (0.66 vs 0.80) and there was a 7.7-minute (95% CI, 10.6 to 4.7) decrease in the median total time spent with EEG suppression (4.0 vs 11.7 min). There were no significant differences between groups in median length of intensive care unit (difference, 0 days [95% CI, -0.31 to 0.31]) or hospital stay (difference, 0 days [95% CI, -0.94 to 0.94]). No patients reported intraoperative awareness. Medical complications occurred in 64 of 567 patients (11.3%) in the EEG-guided group and 73 of 573 (12.7%) in the usual care group. Thirty-day mortality occurred in 8 of 567 patients (1.4%) in the EEG-guided group and 13 of 573 (2.3%) in the usual care group.
Among older adults undergoing cardiac surgery, EEG-guided anesthetic administration to minimize EEG suppression, compared with usual care, did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium. This finding does not support EEG-guided anesthesia for this indication.

However, when the SOZ is in functional cortex (FC), achieving complete and safe resection becomes difficult, due to the seizure network overlap with function. The authors aimed to assess the safety and outcomes of a combined approach involving partial resection combined with focal neuromodulation for FC refractory epilepsy.
The authors performed a retrospective analysis of individuals diagnosed with MRE who underwent surgical intervention from January 2015 to December 2022. Patients whose SOZ was located in FC and were treated with resection combined with simultaneous implantation of a focal neuromodulation device (responsive neurostimulation [RNS] device) with more than 12 months of follow-up data were included. All patients underwent a standard epilepsy preoperative assessment including intracranial electroencephalography and extraoperative stimulation mapping. Resections were performed under general anesthesia, followed by the concurrent implantation of an RNS device.
Seven patients (4 males, median age 32.3 years, all right-handed) were included. The median interval from seizure onset to surgery was 17.4 years. The epileptogenic network included sensorimotor areas (cases 2, 3, and 6), visual cortex (case 1), language areas (cases 4 and 7), and the insula (case 5). The median follow-up was 3 years (range 1-5.8 years). No significant changes in neuropsychological tests were reported. One permanent nondisabling planned neurological deficit (left inferior quadrantanopia) was observed. Six patients had stimulation activated at a median of 4.7 months after resection. All patients achieved good seizure outcomes (5 with Engel class I and 2 with Engel class II outcomes).
Maximal safe resection combined with focal neuromodulation presents a promising alternative to stand-alone resections for MRE epileptogenic zones overlapping with functional brain.

We conducted a single-center, two-group, randomized controlled trial to investigate and compare the incidence of hypotension between remimazolam- and propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). We selected patients aged between 19 and 75 years scheduled for neurosurgery under general anesthesia, who were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I-III and had a history of hypertension.
We included 94 patients in the final analysis. The incidence of hypotension was higher in the propofol group (91.3%) than in the remimazolam group (85.4%; P = 0.057). There was no significant difference in the incidence of hypotension among the various antihypertensive medications despite the majority of patients being on multiple medications. In comparison with the propofol group, the remimazolam group demonstrated a higher heart rate immediately after intubation.
Our study indicated that the hypotension incidence of remimazolam-based TIVA was comparable to that of propofol-based TIVA throughout the induction phase of EEG-guided anesthesia. Both remimazolam and propofol may be equally suitable for general anesthesia in patients undergoing neurosurgery.

In a retrospective cohort of comatose postanoxic patients, EEG was assessed one hour before (baseline) and on hour after discontinuation of propofol. Presence and duration of RPP were related to (changes in) EEG background pattern and duration of sedation.
In eleven (of 36 eligible) patients RPP appeared after propofol discontinuation and disappeared in seven of these patients within one hour. A continuous background pattern at baseline and shorter duration of propofol infusion seemed associated with (earlier) spontaneous disappearance of RPP. In ten patients with RPP at baseline, the EEG did not change, and in one patient it changed into burst-suppression.
Our findings suggest that RPP after propofol discontinuation could be propofol-related.
RPP might be related to propofol discontinuation rather than an expression of severe brain damage, especially in case of, and congruent with, a continuous pattern at the time of propofol discontinuation.

Full-mouth rehabilitation under GA allows for the comprehensive treatment of all oral health problems in a single visit, without requiring the child's active participation. Extensive dental problems are often associated with severe dental pain, which can impact cognitive function, including perception, attention, memory, reasoning, language, communication, and executive functions. Individuals experiencing pain tend to perform less optimally cognitively.
This study aimed to investigate changes in cognition, brain function, and cortical alterations in children who underwent extensive dental rehabilitation under GA.
Thirty uncooperative, healthy children aged 6-12 with extensive dental issues were enrolled. Pain levels were assessed using the FLACC and WBFPS scales before treatment, one week after, and three months later. Cognitive assessments, including the WCST, processing speed, digit span, and Trail Making Test, as well as EEG measurements, were also performed.
The results showed a significant improvement in pain levels reported by the children or their caregivers after the dental procedures, both at one week and three months. All cognitive measures, such as digit span, processing speed, and WCST performance, demonstrated substantial improvements after the treatment. The Trail Making Test also exhibited statistically significant variations before and after the dental procedures. Additionally, the MOCA test revealed a notable improvement in cognitive skills following the treatment. Furthermore, the EEG power ratio, an indicator of changes in the power balance within each frequency band, showed a statistically significant difference after the dental procedures.
the findings of this study suggest that full-mouth rehabilitation under GA can lead to improved pain management, as well as enhanced cognitive and brain functions in children.

At high and low doses, ketamine can generate gamma oscillations (>25 Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The gamma oscillations are interrupted by slow-delta oscillations (0.1 to 4 Hz) at high doses. Ketamine's primary molecular targets and its oscillatory dynamics have been characterized. However, how the actions of ketamine at the subcellular level give rise to the oscillatory dynamics observed at the network level remains unknown. By developing a biophysical model of cortical circuits, we demonstrate how NMDA-receptor antagonism by ketamine can produce the oscillatory dynamics observed in human EEG recordings and nonhuman primate local field potential recordings. We have identified how impaired NMDA-receptor kinetics can cause disinhibition in neuronal circuits and how a disinhibited interaction between NMDA-receptor-mediated excitation and GABA-receptor-mediated inhibition can produce gamma oscillations at high and low doses, and slow-delta oscillations at high doses. Our work uncovers general mechanisms for generating oscillatory brain dynamics that differs from ones previously reported and provides important insights into ketamine's mechanisms of action as an anesthetic and as a therapy for treatment-resistant depression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38768339/

Sixty-three subjects underwent extended research EEG. The median duration of the extended research EEG was 24.3 hours (interquartile range 24.0-25.3). Three subjects (5%) had an EEG change during the extended research EEG that resulted in a change in clinical management, including an increase in ES frequency, differential diagnosis of an event, and new interictal epileptiform discharges. No subjects had new-onset ES during the extended research EEG.
No subjects experienced new-onset ES during the 24-hour extended research EEG period. This finding supports observational data that patients with late-onset ES are rare and suggests that ES prediction models derived from observational data are likely not substantially underrepresenting the incidence of late-onset ES after discontinuation of clinically indicated CEEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38687298/

The interventions for preventing and managing this condition are still poorly known. The aim of this umbrella review is to synthesize and grade all preventative and therapeutic interventions for delirium. We searched five databases from database inception up to March 15th, 2023 and we included meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to decrease the risk of/the severity of delirium. From 1959 records after deduplication, we included 59 systematic reviews with meta-analyses, providing 110 meta-analytic estimates across populations, interventions, outcomes, settings, and age groups (485 unique RCTs, 172,045 participants). In surgery setting, for preventing delirium, high GRADE evidence supported dexmedetomidine (RR=0.53; 95%CI: 0.46-0.67, k=13, N=3988) and comprehensive geriatric assessment (OR=0.46; 95%CI=0.32-0.67, k=3, N=496) in older adults, dexmedetomidine in adults (RR=0.33, 95%CI=0.24-0.45, k=7, N=1974), A2-adrenergic agonists after induction of anesthesia (OR= 0.28, 95%CI= 0.19-0.40, k=10, N=669) in children. High certainty evidence did not support melatonergic agents in older adults for delirium prevention. Moderate certainty supported the effect of dexmedetomidine in adults and children (k=4), various non-pharmacological interventions in adults and older people (k=4), second-generation antipsychotics in adults and mixed age groups (k=3), EEG-guided anesthesia in adults (k=2), mixed pharmacological interventions (k=1), five other specific pharmacological interventions in children (k=1 each). In conclusion, our work indicates that effective treatments to prevent delirium differ across populations, settings, and age groups. Results inform future guidelines to prevent or treat delirium, accounting for safety and costs of interventions.

A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinical trial.gov in accordance with reporting guidelines of PRISMA statement together with the following sources: Google and Google Scholar. We considered eligible prospective studies, written in the English language. The last search was run on the August 2023. Risk of bias and quality assessment were performed. Data extraction was performed by two authors and results were synthesized narratively owing to the heterogeneity of the included studies. Thirteen prospective observational studies (438 patients) were included in the systematic review after the final assessment, with significant diversity in study design. Most studies had a low risk of bias but due to lack of information in one key domain of bias (Bias due to missing data) the overall judgement would be No Information. However, there is no clear indication that the studies are at serious or critical risk of bias. Bearing in mind, the heterogeneity and small sample size of the included studies, current evidence suggests that the alternative infraorbital sensor position is the most comparable for clinical use when the standard sensor position in the forehead is not possible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38676778/

The precise control over the temporary loss of consciousness is vital to ensure safe, pain-free procedures. Traditional methods of depth of anaesthesia (DoA) assessment, reliant on physical characteristics, have proven inconsistent due to individual variations. In response, electroencephalography (EEG) techniques have emerged, with indices such as the Bispectral Index offering quantifiable assessments. This literature review explores the current scope and frontier of DoA research, emphasising methods utilising EEG signals for effective clinical monitoring. This review offers a critical synthesis of recent advances, specifically focusing on electroencephalography (EEG) techniques and their role in enhancing clinical monitoring. By examining 117 high-impact papers, the review delves into the nuances of feature extraction, model building, and algorithm design in EEG-based DoA analysis. Comparative assessments of these studies highlight their methodological approaches and performance, including clinical correlations with established indices like the Bispectral Index. The review identifies knowledge gaps, particularly the need for improved collaboration for data access, which is essential for developing superior machine learning models and real-time predictive algorithms for patient management. It also calls for refined model evaluation processes to ensure robustness across diverse patient demographics and anaesthetic agents. The review underscores the potential of technological advancements to enhance precision, safety, and patient outcomes in anaesthesia, paving the way for a new standard in anaesthetic care. The findings of this review contribute to the ongoing discourse on the application of EEG in anaesthesia, providing insights into the potential for technological advancement in this critical area of medical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38593683/

Glioma patients may experience neurological deficits that are not clinically detectable before sedation. We hypothesized that patients with gliomas exhibit distinct cortical connectivity patterns compared to non-neurosurgical patients during sedation.
This is a secondary analysis of a previously published prospective observational study. Patients scheduled for resection of supratentorial glioma (n=21) or a non-neurosurgical procedure (n=21) under general anesthesia were included in this study. Frontal electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded at different sedation levels as assessed by the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score. Kernel principal component analysis and k -means clustering were used to determine possible temporal dynamics from the weighted phase lag index characteristics.
Ten EEG connectivity states were identified by clustering (76% consistency), each with unique properties. At OAA/S 3, the median (Q1, Q3) occurrence rates of state 6 (glioma group, 0.110 [0.083, 0.155] vs. control group, 0.070 [0.030, 0.110]; P =0.008) and state 7 (glioma group, 0.105 [0.083, 0.148] vs. control group: 0.065 [0.038, 0.090]; P =0.001), which are dominated by beta connectivity, were significantly different between the 2 groups, reflecting differential conversion of the beta band between the left and right brain regions. In addition, the temporal dynamics of the brain's functional connectivity was also reflected in the transition relationships between metastable states.

Previous studies showed that the EEG alpha power shifted from the occipital cortex to the frontal cortex (alpha anteriorization) after being induced into a state of general anesthesia via propofol. The sleep research literature suggests that slow waves and sleep spindles are generated locally and propagated gradually to different brain regions. Since sleep and general anesthesia are conceptualized under the same framework of consciousness, the present study examines whether alpha anteriorization similarly occurs during sleep and how the EEG power in other frequency bands changes during different sleep stages. The results from the analysis of three polysomnography datasets of 234 participants show consistent alpha anteriorization during the sleep stages N2 and N3, beta anteriorization during stage REM, and theta posteriorization during stages N2 and N3. Although it is known that the neural circuits responsible for sleep are not exactly the same for general anesthesia, the findings of alpha anteriorization in this study suggest that, at macro level, the circuits for alpha oscillations are organized in the similar cortical areas. The spatial shifts of EEG power in different frequency bands during sleep may offer meaningful neurophysiological markers for the level of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38562056/

This study aimed to investigate whether preinduction electroencephalogram (EEG) data are useful in determining the optimal propofol dose for the induction of general anesthesia in healthy adult patients.
Seventy healthy adult patients underwent total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), and the effect-site target concentration of propofol was observed to measure each individual's propofol requirements for loss of responsiveness. We analyzed preinduction EEG data to assess its relationship with propofol requirements and conducted multiple regression analyses considering various patient-related factors.
Patients with higher relative delta power (ρ = 0.47, p < 0.01) and higher absolute delta power (ρ = 0.34, p = 0.01) required a greater amount of propofol for anesthesia induction. In contrast, patients with higher relative beta power (ρ = -0.33, p < 0.01) required less propofol to achieve unresponsiveness. Multiple regression analysis revealed an independent association between relative delta power and propofol requirements.
Preinduction EEG, particularly relative delta power, is associated with propofol requirements during the induction of general anesthesia. The utilization of preinduction EEG data may improve the precision of induction dose selection for individuals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38561555/

However, there is limited knowledge regarding the extent and clinical impact of its use and how anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists use the information provided by the DoA monitors in their clinical practice.
This cross-sectional survey on the use of DoA monitors in Norway used a web-based questionnaire distributed to anesthesia personnel in all hospitals in Norway. Participation was voluntary and anonymized, and the web form could not track IP sources or respondents' locations.
Three hundred and ninety-one nurse anesthetists (n = 324) and anesthesiologists (n = 67) responded. Among the EEG-based DoA monitoring tools, BIS was most often used to observe and assess patients' DoA (98%). Raw EEG waveform analysis (10%), EEG-spectrogram (9%), and suppression rate (10%) were seldom used. Twenty-seven percent of the anesthesia personnel were able to recognize a burst suppression pattern on EEG and its significance. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents considered clinical observations more reliable than BIS. Almost all respondents reported adjusting anesthetic dosage based on the BIS index values (80%). However, the anesthetic dose was more often increased (90%) because of high BIS index values than lowered (55%) because of low BIS index values.
Despite our respondents' extensive use of DoA monitoring, the anesthesia personnel in our survey did not use all the information and the potential to guide the titration of anesthetics the DoA monitors provide. Thus, anesthesia personnel could generally benefit from increased knowledge of how EEG-based DoA monitoring can be used to assess and determine individual patients' need for anesthetic medication.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38551019/

In this study, we propose explosive synchronization (ES) as a novel approach to comprehend the hypersensitivity and occurrence of VOCs in the SCD brain network. We hypothesized that the accumulated disruptions in the brain network induced by SCD might lead to strengthened ES and hypersensitivity. We explored ES's relationship with patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) as well as VOCs by analyzing EEG data from 25 SCD patients and 18 matched controls. SCD patients exhibited lower alpha frequency than controls. SCD patients showed correlation between frequency disassortativity (FDA), an ES condition, and three important PROMs. Furthermore, stronger FDA was observed in SCD patients with a higher frequency of VOCs and EEG recording near VOC. We also conducted computational modeling on SCD brain network to study FDA's role in network sensitivity. Our model demonstrated that a stronger FDA could be linked to increased sensitivity and frequency of VOCs. This study establishes connections between SCD pain and the universal network mechanism, ES, offering a strong theoretical foundation. This understanding will aid predicting VOCs and refining pain management for SCD patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38538687/

We aimed to construct an efficient multi-stage prediction model guiding CEEG utilization to identify ES in critically ill children using clinical and EEG covariates.
The largest prospective single-center cohort of 1399 consecutive children undergoing CEEG was analyzed. A four-stage model was developed and trained to predict whether a subject required additional CEEG at the conclusion of each stage given their risk of ES. Logistic regression, elastic net, random forest, and CatBoost served as candidate methods for each stage and were evaluated using cross validation. An optimal multi-stage model consisting of the top-performing stage-specific models was constructed.
When evaluated on a test set, the optimal multi-stage model achieved a cumulative specificity of 0.197 and cumulative F1 score of 0.326 while maintaining a high minimum cumulative sensitivity of 0.938. Overall, 11 % of test subjects with ES were removed from the model due to a predicted low risk of ES (falsely negative subjects). CEEG utilization would be reduced by 32 % and 47 % compared to performing 24 and 48 h of CEEG in all test subjects, respectively. We developed a web application called EEGLE (EEG Length Estimator) that enables straightforward implementation of the model.
Application of the optimal multi-stage ES prediction model could either reduce CEEG utilization for patients at lower risk of ES or promote CEEG resource reallocation to patients at higher risk for ES.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38522169/

Some of these emerging, minimally or non-invasive technologies focus on monitoring brain function and ensuring the integrity of its physiology. Generally, the central nervous system is the least monitored system compared to others, such as the respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal systems, even though it is a primary target in most therapeutic strategies. Frequently, the effects of sedatives, hypnotics, and analgesics are entirely unpredictable, especially in critically ill patients with multiple organ failure. This unpredictability exposes them to the risks of inadequate or excessive sedation/hypnosis, potentially leading to complications and long-term negative outcomes. The International PRactice On TEChnology neuro-moniToring group (I-PROTECT), comprised of experts from various fields of clinical neuromonitoring, presents this document with the aim of reviewing and standardizing the primary non-invasive tools for brain monitoring in anesthesia and intensive care practices. The focus is particularly on standardizing the nomenclature of different parameters generated by these tools. The document addresses processed electroencephalography, continuous/quantitative electroencephalography, brain oxygenation through near-infrared spectroscopy, transcranial Doppler, and automated pupillometry. The clinical utility of the key parameters available in each of these tools is summarized and explained.

This study compares 5 alternate configurations of the Masimo Sedline Sensor.
Ten stably sedated patients in the intensive care unit were recruited. Frontal EEG was monitored in the standard configuration (bifrontal upright) and 5 alternate configurations: bifrontal inverse, infraorbital, lateral upright, lateral inverse, and semilateral. Average power spectral densities (PSDs) with 95% CIs in the alternate configurations were compared to PSDs in the standard configuration. Two-one-sided-testing with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests assessed equivalence in the spectral edge frequency (SEF-95), EEG power, and relative delta (0.5 to 3.5 Hz), alpha (8 to 12 Hz), and beta (20 to 30 Hz) power between each alternate and standard configurations.
After the removal of unanalyzable tracings, 7 patients were included for analysis in the infraorbital configuration and 9 in all other configurations. In the lateral upright and lateral inverse configurations, PSDs significantly differed from the standard configuration within the 15 to 20 Hz band. The greatest decrease in EEG power was in the lateral inverse configuration (median: -97 dB; IQR: -130, -62 dB).

Over the last decade, dexmedetomidine has been increasingly used as an adjunct in the perioperative setting. Its synergistic effect with propofol decreases the dose of propofol needed to induce and maintain general anesthesia. In this pilot study, we evaluate two highly standardized anesthetic regimens for their potential to prevent burst suppression and postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction in a high-risk population. Prospective, randomized clinical trial with non-blinded intervention. Operating room and post anesthesia care unit at Hospital Base San José, Osorno/Universidad Austral, Valdivia, Chile. 23 patients with scheduled non-neurologic, non-cardiac surgeries with age > 69 years and a planned intervention time > 60 min. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a propofol-remifentanil based anesthesia or an anesthetic regimen with dexmedetomidine-propofol-remifentanil. All patients underwent a slow titrated induction, followed by a target controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol and remifentanil (n = 10) or propofol, remifentanil and continuous dexmedetomidine infusion (n = 13). We compared the perioperative EEG signatures, drug-induced changes, and neurocognitive outcomes between two anesthetic regimens in geriatric patients. We conducted a pre- and postoperative Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa) test and measured the level of alertness postoperatively using a sedation agitation scale to assess neurocognitive status. During slow induction, maintenance, and emergence, burst suppression was not observed in either group; however, EEG signatures differed significantly between the two groups. In general, EEG activity in the propofol group was dominated by faster rhythms than in the dexmedetomidine group. Time to responsiveness was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.352). Finally, no significant differences were found in postoperative cognitive outcomes evaluated by the MoCa test nor sedation agitation scale up to one hour after extubation. This pilot study demonstrates that the two proposed anesthetic regimens can be safely used to slowly induce anesthesia and avoid EEG burst suppression patterns. Despite the patients being elderly and at high risk, we did not observe postoperative neurocognitive deficits. The reduced alpha power in the dexmedetomidine-treated group was not associated with adverse neurocognitive outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38451341/
38412114,Permutation Entropy Does Not Track the Electroencephalogram-Related Manifestations of Paradoxical Excitation During Propofol-Induced Loss of Responsiveness: Results From a Prospective Observational Cohort Study.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2025,"Ostertag J, Zanner R, Schneider G, Kreuzer M","During the anesthetic-induced loss of responsiveness (LOR), a ""paradoxical excitation"" with activation of β-frequencies in the electroencephalogram (EEG) can be observed. Thus, spectral parameters-as widely used in commercial anesthesia monitoring devices-may mistakenly indicate that patients are awake when they are actually losing responsiveness. Nonlinear time-domain parameters such as permutation entropy (PeEn) may analyze additional EEG information and appropriately reflect the change in cognitive state during the transition. Determining which parameters correctly track the level of anesthesia is essential for designing monitoring algorithms but may also give valuable insight regarding the signal characteristics during state transitions.
EEG data from 60 patients who underwent general anesthesia were extracted and analyzed around LOR. We derived the following information from the power spectrum: (i) spectral band power, (ii) the spectral edge frequency as well as 2 parameters known to be incorporated in monitoring systems, (iii) beta ratio, and (iv) spectral entropy. We also calculated (v) PeEn as a time-domain parameter. We used Friedman's test and Bonferroni correction to track how the parameters change over time and the area under the receiver operating curve to separate the power spectra between time points.
Within our patient collective, we observed a ""paradoxical excitation"" around the time of LOR as indicated by increasing beta-band power. Spectral edge frequency and spectral entropy values increased from 19.78 [10.25-34.18] Hz to 25.39 [22.46-30.27] Hz ( P = .0122) and from 0.61 [0.54-0.75] to 0.77 [0.64-0.81] ( P < .0001), respectively, before LOR, indicating a (paradoxically) higher level of high-frequency activity. PeEn and beta ratio values decrease from 0.78 [0.77-0.82] to 0.76 [0.73-0.81] ( P < .0001) and from -0.74 [-1.14 to -0.09] to -2.58 [-2.83 to -1.77] ( P < .0001), respectively, better reflecting the state transition into anesthesia.
PeEn and beta ratio seem suitable parameters to monitor the state transition during anesthesia induction. The decreasing PeEn values suggest a reduction of signal complexity and information content, which may very well describe the clinical situation at LOR. The beta ratio mainly focuses on the loss of power in the gamma-band. PeEn, in particular, may present a single parameter capable of tracking the LOR transition without being affected by paradoxical excitation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38412114/

Further utilization of these monitors has also been discussed vividly, for example, reduction of postoperative delirium (POD).It seems that with regard to reducing AUA and POD, these monitors might be applicable, under specific anesthetic protocols. But in other settings, such monitoring might be less contributive and may have a 'built-it glass ceiling'.Recent advances in other venues of electrophysiological monitoring might have a strong theoretical rationale, and early supporting results, to offer a breakthrough out of this metaphorical glass ceiling. The purpose of this review is to present this possibility.
Following previous findings, it might be concluded that for some anesthesia protocols, the prevailing depth of anesthesia monitors may prevent incidences of AUA and POD. However, in other settings, which may involve other anesthesia protocols, or specifically for POD - other perioperative causes, they may not. Attention-related processes measured by easy-to-use real-time electrophysiological markers are becoming feasible, also under anesthesia, and might be applicable for more comprehensive prevention of AUA, POD and possibly other perioperative complications.
Attention-related monitoring might have a strong theoretical basis for the prevention of AUA, POD, and potentially other distressing postoperative outcomes, such as stroke and postoperative neurocognitive disorder.

After reaching remifentanil equilibrium, we administered propofol using a target-controlled infusion pump such that propofol Ce increased to about 0.3 μg/mL/min. After determining Ce-LOR, we administered 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium and started mask ventilation. The study protocol ended after observation of BS.
Three participants were excluded. Ce-LOR in each group (Remi_0, Remi_1, Remi_2) was 2.00 ± 0.58 μg/mL, 1.43 ± 0.49 μg/mL, and 1.37 ± 0.42 μg/mL. Ce-alpha was 2.91 ± 0.63 μg/mL, 2.30 ± 0.41 μg/mL, and 2.12 ± 0.39 μg/mL. Ce-OBS was 3.80 ± 0.69 μg/mL, 3.25 ± 0.68 μg/mL, and 2.90 ± 0.57 μg/mL. In three other instances, Ce was decreased by remifentanil. Generalized linear model analysis revealed that remifentanil had no influence on the relationship between the three Ces.

38374047,A neurophysiological basis for aperiodic EEG and the background spectral trend.,Nature communications,2024,"Brake N, Duc F, Rokos A, Arseneau F, Shahiri S, Khadra A, Plourde G","Electroencephalograms (EEGs) display a mixture of rhythmic and broadband fluctuations, the latter manifesting as an apparent 1/f spectral trend. While network oscillations are known to generate rhythmic EEG, the neural basis of broadband EEG remains unexplained. Here, we use biophysical modelling to show that aperiodic neural activity can generate detectable scalp potentials and shape broadband EEG features, but that these aperiodic signals do not significantly perturb brain rhythm quantification. Further model analysis demonstrated that rhythmic EEG signals are profoundly corrupted by shifts in synapse properties. To examine this scenario, we recorded EEGs of human subjects being administered propofol, a general anesthetic and GABA receptor agonist. Drug administration caused broadband EEG changes that quantitatively matched propofol's known effects on GABA receptors. We used our model to correct for these confounding broadband changes, which revealed that delta power, uniquely, increased within seconds of individuals losing consciousness. Altogether, this work details how EEG signals are shaped by neurophysiological factors other than brain rhythms and elucidates how these signals can undermine traditional EEG interpretation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38374047/

We aimed to assess the association of early EEG background category with MRI ischemia after pediatric CA and determine whether addition of MRI ischemia to EEG background features and clinical variables improves short-term outcome prediction.
This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of pediatric CA with EEG initiated ≤24 hours and MRI obtained ≤7 days of return of spontaneous circulation.

However, its risk factors remain largely to be determined. This study aimed to investigate whether (1) preoperative diabetes is associated with POD after elective orthopedic surgery and (2) intraoperative frontal alpha power is a mediator of the association between preoperative diabetes and POD.
This was a prospective matched cohort study of patients aged 60 years or more, with a preoperative diabetes who underwent elective orthopedic surgery. Nondiabetic patients were matched 1:1 to diabetic patients in terms of age, sex, and type of surgery. Primary outcome was occurrence of POD, assessed using the 3-minute Diagnostic Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM) once daily from 6 pm to 8 pm during the postoperative days 1-7 or until discharge. Secondary outcome was the severity of POD which was assessed for all participants using the short form of the CAM-Severity. Frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded starting before induction of anesthesia and lasting until discharge from the operating room. Intraoperative alpha power was calculated using multitaper spectral analyses. Mediation analysis was used to estimate the proportion of the association between preoperative diabetes and POD that could be explained by intraoperative alpha power.
A total of 138 pairs of eligible patients successfully matched 1:1. After enrollment, 6 patients in the diabetes group and 4 patients in the nondiabetes group were excluded due to unavailability of raw EEG data. The final analysis included 132 participants with preoperative diabetes and 134 participants without preoperative diabetes, with a median age of 68 years and 72.6% of patients were female. The incidence of POD was 16.7% (22/132) in patients with preoperative diabetes vs 6.0% (8/134) in patients without preoperative diabetes. Preoperative diabetes was associated with increased odds of POD after adjustment of age, sex, body mass index, education level, hypertension, arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, and history of stroke (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8.0; P = .009). The intraoperative alpha power accounted for an estimated 20% (95% CI, 2.6-60%; P = .021) of the association between diabetes and POD.
This study suggests that preoperative diabetes is associated with an increased risk of POD in older patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, and that low intraoperative alpha power partially mediates such association.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38335150/

During coma, anesthesia, and sleep, complexity is reduced. During altered states, including after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), complexity is increased. In the present analysis, we examined whether low doses of LSD (13 and 26 µg) were sufficient to increase neural complexity in the absence of altered states of consciousness. In addition, neural complexity was assessed after doses of two other drugs that significantly altered consciousness and mood: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 7.5 and 15 mg) and methamphetamine (MA; 10 and 20 mg). In three separate studies (N = 73; 21, LSD; 23, THC; 29, MA), healthy volunteers received placebo or drug in a within-subjects design over three laboratory visits. During anticipated peak drug effects, resting state electroencephalography (EEG) recorded Limpel-Ziv complexity and spectral power. LSD, but not THC or MA, dose-dependently increased neural complexity. LSD also reduced delta and theta power. THC reduced, and MA increased, alpha power, primarily in frontal regions. Neural complexity was not associated with any subjective drug effect; however, LSD-induced reductions in delta and theta were associated with elation, and THC-induced reductions in alpha were associated with altered states. These data inform relationships between neural complexity, spectral power, and subjective states, demonstrating that increased neural complexity is not necessary or sufficient for altered states of consciousness. Future studies should address whether greater complexity after low doses of LSD is related to cognitive, behavioral, or therapeutic outcomes, and further examine the role of alpha desynchronization in mediating altered states of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38287172/

In this study, Holo-Hilbert spectrum analysis (HHSA) was used to decompose the multichannel EEG signals of 15 patients to obtain the spatial distribution of AM in the brain. Subsequently, HHSA was applied to the prefrontal EEG (Fp1) obtained during general anesthesia surgery in 15 and 34 patients, and the α-θ and α-δ regions of feature (ROFs) were defined in Holo-Hilbert spectrum (HHS) and three features were derived to quantify AM in ROFs.
During anesthetized phase, an anteriorization of the spatial distribution of AMs of α-carrier in brain was observed, as well as AMs of α-θ and α-δ in the EEG of Fp1. The total power ([Formula: see text]), mean carrier frequency ([Formula: see text]) and mean amplitude frequency ([Formula: see text]) of AMs changed during different anesthesia states.
HHSA can effectively analyze the cross-frequency coupling of EEG during anesthesia and the AM features may be applied to anesthesia monitoring.

To date, the effect of frailty on intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) changes remains unexplored. The present study, an exploratory analysis of a prospective cohort study, aimed to investigate the differences in EEG characteristics between frail and robust patients. This prospective observational study was conducted between December 2020 and November 2021. The preoperative frailty status was assessed using the FRAIL scale. The patients' baseline (before anesthesia) and intraoperative EEG data were collected using a brain function monitor. Finally, 20 robust and 26 frail older patients scheduled for elective spinal surgery or transurethral prostatectomy under propofol-based general anesthesia were included in the final analysis. Baseline and intraoperative EEG spectrogram and power spectra were compared between the frail and robust groups. No differences were observed in baseline EEG between the frail and robust groups. When the intraoperative EEG spectral parameters were compared, the alpha peak frequency (10.56 ± 0.49 vs. 10.14 ± 0.36 Hz, P = 0.002) and alpha peak, delta, theta, alpha, and beta powers were lower in the frail group. After adjusting for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, the FRAIL score was still negatively associated with total, delta, theta, alpha, and beta powers. Frail patients had reduced EEG (0-30 Hz) power after the induction of propofol-based general anesthesia.

A common approach is to restrict the pattern matching step to local maxima of the global field power (GFP) and to interpolate the microstate fit in between. In this study, we investigate how the anesthetic propofol affects microstate sequence periodicity and predictability, and how these metrics are changed by interpolation. We performed two frequency analyses on microstate sequences, one based on time-lagged mutual information, the other based on Fourier transform methodology, and quantified the effects of interpolation. Resting-state microstate sequences had a 20 Hz frequency peak related to dominant 10 Hz (alpha) rhythms, and the Fourier approach demonstrated that all five microstate classes followed this frequency. The 20 Hz periodicity was reversibly attenuated under moderate propofol sedation, as shown by mutual information and Fourier analysis. Characteristic microstate frequencies could only be observed in non-interpolated microstate sequences and were masked by smoothing effects of interpolation. Information-theoretic analysis revealed faster microstate dynamics and larger entropy rates under propofol, whereas Shannon entropy did not change significantly. In moderate sedation, active information storage decreased for non-interpolated sequences. Signatures of non-equilibrium dynamics were observed in non-interpolated sequences, but no changes were observed between sedation levels. All changes occurred while subjects were able to perform an auditory perception task. In summary, we show that low dose propofol reversibly increases the randomness of microstate sequences and attenuates microstate oscillations without correlation to cognitive task performance. Microstate dynamics between GFP peaks reflect physiological processes that are not accessible in interpolated sequences.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38228923/

EEG directly measures the effects of anesthetics on the brain, which is the target end-organ responsible for inducing loss of consciousness. Over the past ten years, research on anesthesia and computational neuroscience has improved our understanding of intraoperative pediatric EEG monitoring and expanded the utility of EEG in clinical practice. We now have better insights into neurodevelopmental changes in the developing pediatric brain, functional connectivity, the use of non-proprietary EEG parameters to guide anesthetic dosing, epileptiform EEG changes during induction, EEG changes from spinal/regional anesthesia, EEG discontinuity, and the use of EEG to improve clinical outcomes.

Sweeping across the cortex, the electrocorticographic depression is supposed to underlie spreading negative symptoms of migraine aura. Main information about the suppressive effect of SD on cortical oscillations was obtained in anesthetized animals while ictal recordings in conscious patients failed to detect EEG depression during migraine aura. Here, we investigate the suppressive effect of SD on spontaneous cortical activity in awake animals and examine whether the anesthesia modifies the SD effect.
Spectral and spatiotemporal characteristics of spontaneous cortical activity following a single unilateral SD elicited by amygdala pinprick were analyzed in awake freely behaving rats and after induction of urethane anesthesia.
In wakefulness, SD transiently suppressed cortical oscillations in all frequency bands except delta. Slow delta activity did not decline its power during SD and even increased it afterwards; high-frequency gamma oscillations showed the strongest and longest depression under awake conditions. Unexpectedly, gamma power reduced not only during SD invasion the recording cortical sites but also when SD occupied distant subcortical/cortical areas. Contralateral cortex not invaded by SD also showed transient depression of gamma activity in awake animals. Introduction of general anesthesia modified the pattern of SD-induced depression: SD evoked the strongest cessation of slow delta activity, milder suppression of fast oscillations and no distant changes in gamma activity.
Slow and fast cortical oscillations differ in their vulnerability to SD influence, especially in wakefulness. In the conscious brain, SD produces stronger and spatially broader depression of fast cortical oscillations than slow ones. The frequency-specific effects of SD on cortical activity of awake brain may underlie some previously unexplained clinical features of migraine aura.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38225575/

Technological improvements have led to new monitoring strategies, aimed at translating a qualitative physiological state into quantitative metrics, but the optimal strategies for depth of anesthesia (DoA) and analgesia monitoring continue to stimulate debate. Historically, DoA monitoring used patient's movement as a surrogate of awareness. Pharmacokinetic models and metrics, including minimum alveolar concentration for inhaled anesthetics and target-controlled infusion models for intravenous anesthesia, provided further insights to clinicians, but electroencephalography and its derivatives (processed EEG; pEEG) offer the potential for personalization of anesthesia care. Current studies appear to affirm that pEEG monitoring decreases the quantity of anesthetics administered, diminishes postanesthesia care unit duration, and may reduce the occurrence of postoperative delirium (notwithstanding the difficulties of defining this condition). Major trials are underway to further elucidate the impact on postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In this manuscript, we discuss the Bispectral (BIS) index, Narcotrend monitor, Patient State Index, entropy-based monitoring, and Neurosense monitor, as well as middle latency evoked auditory potential, before exploring how these technologies could evolve in the upcoming years. In contrast to developments in pEEG monitors, nociception monitors remain by comparison underdeveloped and underutilized. Just as with anesthetic agents, excessive analgesia can lead to harmful side effects, whereas inadequate analgesia is associated with increased stress response, poorer hemodynamic conditions and coagulation, metabolic, and immune system dysregulation. Broadly, 3 distinct monitoring strategies have emerged: motor reflex, central nervous system, and autonomic nervous system monitoring. Generally, nociceptive monitors outperform basic clinical vital sign monitoring in reducing perioperative opioid use. This manuscript describes pupillometry, surgical pleth index, analgesia nociception index, and nociception level index, and suggest how future developments could impact their use. The final section of this review explores the profound implications of future monitoring technologies on anesthesiology practice and envisages 3 transformative scenarios: helping in creation of an optimal analgesic drug, the advent of bidirectional neuron-microelectronic interfaces, and the synergistic combination of hypnosis and virtual reality.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38215709/

In school-aged children, the routine practice of rapid induction with high concentrations of inspiratory sevoflurane is commonplace, given its favorable efficacy and tolerance profile. However, few studies investigate topographic EEG during the critical timepoint coinciding with loss of responsiveness-a key moment for anesthesiologists in their everyday practice. The authors hypothesized that high initial sevoflurane inhalation would better precipitate changes in brain regions due to inhomogeneities in maturation across three different age groups compared with gradual stepwise paradigms utilized by other investigators. Knowledge of these changes may inform strategies for agent titration in everyday clinical settings.
A total of 37 healthy children aged 5 to 10 yr underwent induction with 4% or greater sevoflurane in high-flow oxygen. Perturbations in anesthetic state were investigated in 23 of these children using 64-channel EEG with the Hjorth Laplacian referencing scheme. Topographical maps illustrated absolute, relative, and total band power across three age groups: 5 to 6 yr (n = 7), 7 to 8 yr (n = 8), and 9 to 10 yr (n = 8).
Spectral analysis revealed a large shift in total power driven by increased delta oscillations. Well-described topographic patterns of anesthesia, e.g., frontal predominance, paradoxical beta excitation, and increased slow activity, were evident in the topographic maps. However, there were no statistically significant age-related changes in spectral power observed in a midline electrode subset between the groups when responsiveness was lost compared to the resting state.
High initial concentration sevoflurane induction causes large-scale topographic effects on the pediatric EEG. Within the minute after unresponsiveness, this dosage may perturb EEG activity in children to an extent where age-related differences are not discernible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38207324/

This was a prospective observational study of consecutive critically ill children with encephalopathy who underwent CEEG. We used descriptive statistics to characterize ES and ESE, and we developed a model for ESE prediction.
ES occurred in 25% of 1,399 subjects. Among subjects with ES, 23% had ESE, including 37% with continuous seizures lasting >30 minutes and 63% with recurrent seizures totaling 30 minutes within a 1-hour epoch. The median onset of ES and ESE occurred 1.8 and 0.18 hours after CEEG initiation, respectively. The optimal model for ESE prediction yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.81. A cutoff selected to emphasize sensitivity (91%) yielded specificity of 56%. Given the 6% ESE incidence, positive predictive value was 11% and negative predictive value was 99%. If the model were applied to our cohort, then 53% of patients would not undergo CEEG and 8% of patients experiencing ESE would not be identified.
ESE was common, but most patients with ESE had recurrent brief seizures rather than long individual seizures.

Anesthetics induce unconsciousness in part by impinging upon sexually dimorphic and hormonally sensitive hypothalamic circuits regulating sleep and wakefulness. Thus, we hypothesized that anesthetic sensitivity should be sex-dependent and modulated by sex hormones. Using distinct behavioral measures, we show that at identical brain anesthetic concentrations, female mice are more resistant to volatile anesthetics than males. Anesthetic sensitivity is bidirectionally modulated by testosterone. Castration increases anesthetic resistance. Conversely, testosterone administration acutely increases anesthetic sensitivity. Conversion of testosterone to estradiol by aromatase is partially responsible for this effect. In contrast, oophorectomy has no effect. To identify the neuronal circuits underlying sex differences, we performed whole brain c-Fos activity mapping under anesthesia in male and female mice. Consistent with a key role of the hypothalamus, we found fewer active neurons in the ventral hypothalamic sleep-promoting regions in females than in males. In humans, we demonstrate that females regain consciousness and recover cognition faster than males after identical anesthetic exposures. Remarkably, while behavioral and neurocognitive measures in mice and humans point to increased anesthetic resistance in females, cortical activity fails to show sex differences under anesthesia in either species. Cumulatively, we demonstrate that sex differences in anesthetic sensitivity are evolutionarily conserved and not reflected in conventional electroencephalographic-based measures of anesthetic depth. This covert resistance to anesthesia may explain the higher incidence of unintended awareness under general anesthesia in females.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38190526/

Large randomized trials have addressed the early phases of treatment for convulsive SE. However, evidence regarding third-line anesthetic treatment and the treatment of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is scarce. One trial addressing management of refractory SE with deep general anesthesia was terminated early due to insufficient recruitment. Multicenter prospective registries, including the Sustained Effort Network for treatment of Status Epilepticus (SENSE), have shed some light on these questions, but many answers are still lacking, such as the influence exerted by distinct EEG patterns in NCSE on the outcome. We therefore initiated a new prospective multicenter observational registry to collect clinical and EEG data that combined may further help in clinical decision-making and defining SE.
Sustained effort network for treatment of status epilepticus/European Academy of Neurology Registry on refractory Status Epilepticus (SENSE-II/AROUSE) is a prospective, multicenter registry for patients treated for SE. The primary objectives are to document patient and SE characteristics, treatment modalities, EEG, neuroimaging data, and outcome of consecutive adults admitted for SE treatment in each of the participating centers and to identify factors associated with outcome and refractoriness. To reach sufficient statistical power for multivariate analysis, a cohort size of 3000 patients is targeted.
The data collected for the registry will provide both valuable EEG data and information about specific treatment steps in different patient groups with SE. Eventually, the data will support clinical decision-making and may further guide the planning of clinical trials. Finally, it could help to redefine NCSE and its management.

We aimed to distinguish the EEG characteristics of sevoflurane and desflurane in relation to POD development.
We collected frontal four-channel EEG data during the maintenance of anesthesia from 148 elderly patients who received sevoflurane (n = 77) or desflurane (n = 71); 30 patients were diagnosed with delirium postoperatively. The patients were divided into four subgroups based on anesthetics and delirium status: sevoflurane delirium (n = 17), sevoflurane non-delirium (n = 60), desflurane delirium (n = 13), and desflurane non-delirium (n = 58). We compared spectral power, coherence, and pairwise phase consistency (PPC) between sevoflurane and desflurane, and between non-delirium and delirium groups for each anesthetic.
In patients without POD, the sevoflurane non-delirium group exhibited higher EEG spectral power across 8.5-35 Hz (99.5% CI bootstrap analysis) and higher PPC from alpha to gamma bands (p < 0.005) compared to the desflurane non-delirium group. Conversely, in patients with POD, no significant EEG differences were observed between the sevoflurane and desflurane delirium groups. For the sevoflurane-induced patients, the sevoflurane delirium group had significantly lower power within 7.5-31.5 Hz (99.5% CI bootstrap analysis), reduced coherence over 8.9-23.8 Hz (99.5% CI bootstrap analysis), and lower PPC values in the alpha band (p < 0.005) compared with the sevoflurane non-delirium group. For the desflurane-induced patients, there were no significant differences in the EEG patterns between delirium and non-delirium groups.
In normal patients without POD, sevoflurane demonstrates a higher power spectrum and prefrontal connectivity than desflurane. Furthermore, reduced frontal alpha power, coherence, and connectivity of intraoperative EEG could be associated with an increased risk of POD. These intraoperative EEG characteristics associated with POD are more noticeable in sevoflurane-induced anesthesia than in desflurane-induced anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38157663/

Spatiotemporal complexity is a promising tool for investigating consciousness. The authors hypothesized that spatiotemporal complexity may serve as a state-related but not drug-related electroencephalography (EEG) indicator during an unconscious state induced by different anesthetic drugs (e.g., propofol and esketamine).
The authors recorded EEG from patients with unconsciousness induced by propofol (n = 10) and esketamine (n = 10). Both conventional microstate parameters and microstate complexity were analyzed. Spatiotemporal complexity was constructed by microstate sequences and complexity measures. Two different EEG microstate complexities were proposed to quantify the randomness (type I) and complexity (type II) of the EEG microstate series during the time course of the general anesthesia.
The coverage and occurrence of microstate E (prefrontal pattern) and the duration of microstate B (right frontal pattern) could distinguish the states of preinduction wakefulness, unconsciousness, and recovery under both anesthetics. Type I EEG microstate complexity based on mean information gain significantly increased from awake to unconsciousness state (propofol: from mean ± SD, 1.562 ± 0.059 to 1.672 ± 0.023, P < 0.001; esketamine: 1.599 ± 0.051 to 1.687 ± 0.013, P < 0.001), and significantly decreased from unconsciousness to recovery state (propofol: 1.672 ± 0.023 to 1.537 ± 0.058, P < 0.001; esketamine: 1.687 ± 0.013 to 1.608 ± 0.028, P < 0.001) under both anesthetics. In contrast, type II EEG microstate fluctuation complexity significantly decreased in the unconscious state under both drugs (propofol: from 2.291 ± 0.771 to 0.782 ± 0.163, P < 0.001; esketamine: from 1.645 ± 0.417 to 0.647 ± 0.252, P < 0.001), and then increased in the recovery state (propofol: 0.782 ± 0.163 to 2.446 ± 0.723, P < 0.001; esketamine: 0.647 ± 0.252 to 1.459 ± 0.264, P < 0.001).
Both type I and type II EEG microstate complexities are drug independent. Thus, the EEG microstate complexity measures that the authors proposed are promising tools for building state-related neural correlates of consciousness to quantify anesthetic-induced unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38157438/

Combining both drugs at low dose levels offers new opportunities. However, monitoring the hypnotic effects of this drug combination in children is challenging, because the currently available processed EEG-based systems are insufficiently validated in young children and the co-administration of anesthetics. This study investigated electroencephalographic density spectral array monitoring during propofol/sevoflurane coadministration with fixed sevoflurane- and variable propofol dosages.
We analyzed the density spectral array pattern recorded during propofol/sevoflurane anesthesia in pediatric patients from birth to 11 years of age. Data from 78 patients were suitable for analysis. The primary outcome parameter of this study was the correlation between variable propofol dosages and the expression of the four electroencephalogram frequency bands β, α, θ, and δ. The main secondary outcome parameters were the intra-operative total EEG power and the prevalence of burst suppression.
In patients above the age of 1 year, a dose-dependent correlation between the propofol dosage and the relative percentage of β (-12.2%, p < 0.001) and δ (5.1%, p < 0.001) was found. There was an age-dependent trend toward increasing mean EEG power, with the most significant increase in the first year of life. In 14.1% of our patients, at least one episode of burst suppression occurred.
DSA-guided augmentation of propofol anesthesia with sevoflurane provides sufficient depth of anesthesia at doses usually considered sub-anesthetic in children, leading to less anesthetic drug exposure for the individual child.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38142866/

The existing EEG-based monitors classified general anesthesia states as underdosed, adequate, or overdosed, lacking predictive power due to the absence of transition phases among these states. In response to this limitation, we undertook an analysis of the EEG signal during isoflurane-induced general anesthesia in mice. Adopting a data-driven approach, we applied signal processing techniques to track θ- and δ-band dynamics, along with iso-electric suppressions. Combining this approach with machine learning, we successfully developed an automated algorithm. The findings of our study revealed that the dampening of the δ-band occurred several minutes before the onset of significant iso-electric suppression episodes. Furthermore, a distinct γ-frequency oscillation was observed, persisting for several minutes during the recovery phase subsequent to isoflurane-induced overdose. As a result of our research, we generated a map summarizing multiple brain states and their transitions, offering a tool for predicting and preventing overdose during general anesthesia. The transition phases identified, along with the developed algorithm, have the potential to be generalized, enabling clinicians to prevent inadequate anesthesia and, consequently, tailor anesthetic regimens to individual patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38135170/

This study aimed to assess the agreement of BIS values based on the positions of either post-auricular or frontal sensors in individual patients undergoing renal surgeries while lateral positions at various stages of anesthesia.
12 patients older than 18 years, ASA I-III patients scheduled for elective renal operations, two BIS were placed on each patient, one on each side of the post-auricular region and one across the forehead, and each sensor was connected to a different BIS monitor. We gathered three pieces of data at each of the six-time points: BIS score, signal quality index (SQI) score calculating the signal's strength and electromyography (EMG) score: before the onset of anesthesia (awake) when the eyelash reflex is lost (LOC), after intubation (intubation), following the initial surgical incision, each 30 min throughout the procedure (maintenance), and at the moment the patient's eyes open naturally after waking up from anesthesia (emergence).
The overall BIS value at the frontal position was significantly higher than the post-auricular position (52.5 ± 22.2 and 52.1 ± 22.1, respectively, P = 0.010). On the other hand, the BIS value was comparable between the frontal and post-auricular positions at LOC, intubation, 60, 120, and 80 min and at emergence. A strong link between the two sensor positions, as indicated by the correlation coefficient (r = 0.607, P < 0.001), and the Bland-Altman analysis revealed a small mean difference (-1.8) and a low (9.0/- 12.5) limit of agreement, with just 4.3% of the readings falling outside of it during the anesthetic maintenance period.
Acceptable variation in BIS data was observed when obtained from the two different sensor positions for clinical usage. The post-auricular BIS sensor system may be a suitable substitute for an impractical frontal setup.

Substance-specific emergence characteristics may additionally limit the reliability of commonly used processed EEG indices during emergence. This study aims to analyze the dynamics of different EEG indices during anesthesia emergence that was maintained with different anesthetic regimens. We used the EEG of 45 patients under general anesthesia from the emergence period. Fifteen patients per group received sevoflurane, isoflurane (+ sufentanil) or propofol (+ remifentanil) anesthesia. One channel EEG and the bispectral index (BIS A-1000) were recorded during the study. We replayed the EEG back to the Conox, Entropy Module, and the BIS Vista to evaluate and compare the index behavior. The volatile anesthetics induced significantly higher EEG frequencies, causing higher indices (AUC > 0.7) over most parts of emergence compared to propofol. The median duration of ""awake"" indices (i.e., > 80) before the return of responsiveness (RoR) was significantly longer for the volatile anesthetics (p < 0.001). The different indices correlated well under volatile anesthesia (rs > 0.6), with SE having the weakest correlation. For propofol, the correlation was lower (rs < 0.6). SE was significantly higher than BIS and, under propofol anesthesia, qCON. Systematic differences of EEG-based indices depend on the drugs and devices used. Thus, to avoid early awareness or anesthesia overdose using an EEG-based index during emergence, the anesthetic regimen, the monitor used, and the raw EEG trace should be considered for interpretation before making clinical decisions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38108943/

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,2023,"Zhao Y, Boley M, Pelentritou A, Woods W, Liley D, Kuhlmann L","This study characterizes the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying electromagnetic imaging signals using stability analysis. Researchers have proposed that transitions between conscious awake and anaesthetised states, and other brain states more generally, may result from system stability changes. The concept of stability in dynamical systems theory provides a mathematical framework to describe this possibility. In particular, the degree to which a system's trajectory in phase space is affected by small perturbations determines the stability. Previous studies using linear or oscillator-based whole-brain models cannot represent complex cerebrocortical dynamics, or model parameters were pre-assumed or inferred from data but did not change over time. This study proposes a nonlinear neurophysiologically plausible whole-cortex modeling framework to analyze the stability of brain dynamics for the emergence and disappearance of consciousness using time-varying parameters estimated from the data.Clinical relevance- Depth of anaesthesia is typically measured through changes in EEG statistics like the bispectral index and spectral entropy. However, these monitors have been found to fail in preventing awareness during surgery and postoperative recall. Our whole-cortex stability analysis may be useful in measuring anaesthesia levels in clinical settings, as it changes with the level of consciousness and is independent of individual differences and anaesthetic agents. The proposed method can also be used to, for example, identify critical brain regions for consciousness, locate the epileptogenic zone and investigate the dominance of extrinsic or intrinsic factors in brain functions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38082665/

With the emergence of advanced EEG sensors, that may be able to record and process signals in much more compact units, this additional sensor technology now opens up opportunities to revisit current ambulatory EEG recording practices and specific patient populations, and even electrodes that are embedded into the head surface. Here, we aim to provide an overview of current limited sensor long-term EEG systems. We performed a literature review using Pubmed as a database and included the relevant articles. The review identified several systems for recording long-term ambulatory EEGs. In general, EEGs recorded with these modalities can be acquired in ambulatory and home settings, achieve good sensitivity with low false detection rates, are used for automatic seizure detection as well as seizure forecasting, and are well tolerated by patients, but each of them has advantages and disadvantages. Subcutaneous, subgaleal, and subscalp electrodes are minimally invasive and provide stable signals that can record ultra--long-term EEG and are in general less noisy than scalp EEG, but they have limited spatial coverage and require anesthesia, a surgical procedure and a trained surgeon to be placed. Behind and in the ear electrodes are discrete, unobtrusive with a good sensitivity mainly for temporal seizures but might miss extratemporal seizures, recordings could be obscured by muscle artifacts and bilateral ictal patterns might be difficult to register. Finally, recording systems using electrodes in a headband can be easily and quickly placed by the patient or caregiver, but have less spatial coverage and are more prone to movement because electrodes are not attached. Overall, limited EEG recording systems offer a promising opportunity to potentially record targeted EEG with focused indications for prolonged periods, but further validation work is needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38070411/

We investigated the correlation of the electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters with the effect-site remimazolam concentration and the depth of sedation in patients receiving a target-controlled infusion of remimazolam.
This prospective observational study enrolled 35 patients (32 analyzed) who underwent lower extremity varicose vein surgery or lower extremity orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia. We administered remimazolam by target-controlled infusion using the pharmacokinetic model introduced by Schüttler et al. The EEG data were continuously recorded, including the bispectral index (BIS), patient state index (PSI), spectral edge frequency (SEF), and raw EEG signals. The relative beta ratio (RBR), defined as log (spectral power [30-47 Hz]/spectral power [11-20 Hz]), was obtained by analyzing raw EEG. The level of sedation corresponding to each effect-site remimazolam concentration was assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S). The prediction probability (Pk) and Spearman's correlation coefficients (R) were calculated between effect-site remimazolam concentration, MOAA/S, and EEG parameters.
BIS and PSI showed significantly higher Pk for effect-site remimazolam concentration (Pk = 0.76 [0.72-0.79], P < .001 for BIS; Pk = 0.76 [0.73-0.79], P < .001 for PSI) compared to RBR (Pk = 0.71 [0.68-0.74], P < .001) and SEF (Pk = 0.58 [0.53-0.63], P = .002).

However, some clinicians avoid using it because of sudden unwanted acting out or patient arousal. Previous studies suggested sugammadex-induced awakening, but frontal muscle contraction after sugammadex administration compromised reliability of results obtained from EEG-based anesthesia depth monitoring tools like bispectral index (BIS). We hypothesized that sugammadex would affect patients' arousal depending on their baseline levels of sedation. We evaluated arousal signs after sugammadex administration with BIS between 25 - 35 and 45 - 55 under steady-state propofol-remifentanil anesthesia at the end of a surgery (n = 33 in each group).

Whether processed electroencephalography (p-EEG) is useful in this setting is unclear.
To describe the PSI index in deeply sedated critically ill patients with acute organ failure, and to examine a potential association between low PSI values and ICU delirium. [Correction added on 16 October 2024, after first online publication: Aim subsection in Abstract has been added on this version.] METHODS: We conducted a single-centre observational study of non-neurological ICU patients sedated according to a standardized guideline of deep sedation (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale [RASS] between -5 and -4) during the acute phase of respiratory and/or cardio-circulatory failure. The SedLine (Masimo Incorporated, Irvine, California) was used to monitor the Patient State Index (PSI) (ranging from 0 to 100, <25 = very deep sedation and >50 = light sedation to full awareness) during the first 72 h of care. Delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU).
The median duration of PSI monitoring was 43 h. Patients spent 49% in median of the total PSI monitoring duration with a PSI <25. Patients with delirium (n = 41/97, 42%) spent a higher percentage of total monitored time with PSI <25 (median 67% [19-91] vs. 47% [12.2-78.9]) in non-delirious patients (p .047). After adjusting for the cumulative dose of analgesia and sedation, increased time spent with PSI <25 was associated with higher delirium (odds ratio 1.014; 95% CI 1.001-1.027, p = .036).
A clinical protocol of deep sedation targeted to RASS at the acute ICU phase may be associated with prolonged EEG suppression and increased delirium. Whether PSI-targeted sedation may help reducing sedative dose and delirium deserves further clinical investigation.
Patients requiring deep sedation are at high risk of being over-sedated and developing delirium despite the application of an evidence-based sedation guideline.

It has been proposed that decreasing the amount of anesthetics by titrating to an EEG index will lower POD rate, but clear evidence is missing. A strong age-dependent negative correlation has been reported between the peak oscillatory frequency of alpha waves and end-tidal anesthetic concentration, with older patients generating slower alpha frequencies. We hypothesized, that slower alpha oscillations are associated with a higher rate of POD.
Retrospective analysis of patients` data from a prospective observational study in cardiac surgical patients approved by the Bernese Ethics committee. Frontal EEG was recorded during Isoflurane effect-site concentrations of 0.7 to 0.8 and peak alpha frequency was measured at highest power between 6 and 17 Hz. Delirium was assessed by chart review. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between POD and non-POD groups. Selection bias was addressed using nearest neighbor propensity score matching (PSM) for best balance. This incorporated 18 variables, whereas patients with missing variable information or without an alpha oscillation were excluded.
Of the 1072 patients in the original study, 828 were included, 73 with POD, 755 without. PSM allowed 328 patients into the final analysis, 67 with, 261 without POD. Before PSM, 8 variables were significantly different between POD and non-POD groups, none thereafter. Mean peak alpha frequency was significantly lower in the POD in contrast to non-POD group before and after matching (7.9 vs 8.9 Hz, 7.9 vs 8.8 Hz respectively, SD 1.3, p < 0.001).
Intraoperative slower frontal peak alpha frequency is independently associated with POD after cardiac surgery and may be a simple intraoperative neurophysiological marker of a vulnerable brain for POD. Further studies are needed to investigate if there is a causal link between alpha frequency and POD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37995609/
37974297,Protocol for a randomized controlled trial to reduce pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium by titration of sevoflurane anesthesia using brain function monitoring.,Trials,2023,"Suzuki Y, Miyasaka KW, Hayashi K, Takahashi O, Nagasaka Y","Emergence agitation or emergence delirium is a common complication of unknown etiology in pediatric anesthesia. Pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) has been reported most commonly in younger children and may occur in about 30% of children up to 5-6 years old. Exposure to anesthetic agents may contribute to PAED, and we hypothesized that a management strategy to minimize exposure to volatile anesthetics may reduce PAED. Electroencephalography (EEG) signatures captured and displayed by brain function monitors during anesthesia change with concentration of sevoflurane and level of unconsciousness, and these EEG signatures may be used to inform titration of anesthetics.
A single-center, parallel-group, two-arm, superiority trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio will be performed to compare the incidence of PAED following standard sevoflurane anesthesia (maintained at 1.0MAC) and EEG-guided anesthesia (minimum concentration to sustain surgical anesthesia as determined by monitoring of EEG signatures). Participants between 1 and 6 years of age undergoing surgical procedures involving minimal postoperative pain will be randomly assigned to receive standard (n = 90) or EEG-guided (n = 90) anesthesia. PAED score will be assessed by a blinded observer in the PACU on arrival and after 5, 10, 15, and 30 min.
Anesthesia management with proactive use of brain function monitoring is expected to reduce exposure to sevoflurane without compromising surgical anesthesia. We expect this reduced exposure should help prevent PAED. Routinely administering what may be considered standard levels of anesthetic such as 1.0 MAC sevoflurane may be excessive and potentially associated with unfavorable sequelae such as PAED.

However, genetic factors contributing to severe phenotypes of FCD remain unknown. We present a patient with an exceptionally rapid development of drug-resistant epilepsy evolving in super-refractory status epilepticus. We performed multiple clinical (serial EEG, MRI), biochemical (metabolic and immunological screening), genetic (WES from blood- and brain-derived DNA), and histopathological investigations. The patient presented 1 month after an uncomplicated varicella infection. MRI was negative, as well as other biochemical and immunological examinations. Whole-exome sequencing of blood-derived DNA detected a heterozygous paternally inherited variant NM_006267.4(RANBP2):c.5233A>G p.(Ile1745Val) (Chr2[GRCh37]:g.109382228A>G), a gene associated with a susceptibility to infection-induced acute necrotizing encephalopathy. No combination of anti-seizure medication led to a sustained seizure freedom and the patient warranted induction of propofol anesthesia with high-dose intravenous midazolam and continuous respiratory support that however failed to abort seizure activity. Brain biopsy revealed FCD type IIa; this finding led to the indication of an emergency right-sided hemispherotomy that rendered the patient temporarily seizure-free. Postsurgically, he remains on antiseizure medication and experiences rare nondisabling seizures. This report highlights a uniquely severe clinical course of FCD putatively modified by the RANBP2 variant. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: We report a case summary of a patient who came to our attention for epilepsy that could not be controlled with medication. His clinical course progressed rapidly to life-threatening status epilepticus with other unusual neurological findings. Therefore, we decided to surgically remove a piece of brain tissue in order to clarify the diagnosis that showed features of a structural brain abnormality associated with severe epilepsy, the focal cortical dysplasia. Later, a genetic variant in a gene associated with another condition, was found, and we hypothesize that this genetic variant could have contributed to this severe clinical course of our patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37943122/

Noninvasive neuromonitoring modalities including diffuse correlation spectroscopy and EEG measure cerebral perfusion and neuronal function, respectively. We hypothesized that encephalopathic ECMO patients with greater degree of irreversible cerebral injury demonstrate less correlation between electrographic activity and cerebral perfusion than those whose encephalopathy is attributable to medications.
We performed a prospective observational study of adults undergoing ECMO who underwent simultaneous continuous EEG and diffuse correlation spectroscopy monitoring. (Alpha + beta)/delta ratio and alpha/delta Rartio derived from quantitative EEG analysis were correlated with frontal cortical blood flow index. Patients who awakened and followed commands during sedation pauses were included in group 1, whereas patients who could not follow commands for most neuromonitoring were placed in group 2. (Alpha + beta)/delta ratio-blood flow index and ADR-BFI correlations were compared between the groups.
Ten patients (five in each group) underwent 39 concomitant continuous EEG and diffuse correlation spectroscopy monitoring sessions. Four patients (80%) in each group received some form of analgosedation during neuromonitoring. (Alpha + beta)/delta ratio-blood flow index correlation was significantly lower in group 2 than group 1 (left: 0.05 vs. 0.52, P = 0.03; right: -0.12 vs. 0.39, P = 0.04). Group 2 ADR-BFI correlation was lower only over the right hemisphere (-0.06 vs. 0.47, P = 0.04).
Correlation between (alpha + beta)/delta ratio and blood flow index were decreased in encephalopathic ECMO patients compared with awake ones, regardless of the analgosedation use. The combined use of EEG and diffuse correlation spectroscopy may have utility in monitoring cerebral function in ECMO patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37934074/

Our aim was to investigate the congruity PSI and SR with raw EEG monitoring in neurosurgery.
We included 34 patients undergoing elective cranial neurosurgery. Each patient was monitored by a SedLine device (PSI and SR) and by raw EEG. To appraise the agreement between PSI, SR and EEG Suppr%, Bland-Altman analysis was used. We also correlated the PSI and SR recorded at different times during surgery to the degree of suppression of the raw EEG data by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. For a comparison with previous data we made an international literature review according to PRISMA protocol.
At all recording times, we found that there is a strong agreement between PSI and raw EEG. We also found a significant correlation for both PSI and SR with the EEG suppression percentage (p < 0.05), but with a broad dispersion of the individual values within the confidence interval.
The Masimo SedLine processed EEG monitoring system can be used as a guide in the anaesthetic management of patients during elective cranial neurosurgery, but the anaesthesiologist must be aware that previous correlations between PSI and SR with the suppression percentage may not always be valid in all individual patients. The use of an extended visual raw EEG evaluated by an expert electroencephalographer might help to provide better guidance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37926053/

The term was introduced by Swank and Watson in 1949 but was initially described by Derbyshire et al. in 1936 in their study about the anesthetic effects of tribromoethanol. Once the EEG/BSP pattern emerged in the literature as therapeutic goal in refractory status epilepticus, researchers began exploring whether the depth of EEG suppression correlated with improved seizure control and clinical outcomes. We can conclude that, from a historical perspective, the evidence to suppress the brain to a BSP when treating status epilepticus is inconclusive.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37921932/

A major limitation of prior studies is the use of responsiveness as an index of consciousness. We identified a collection of measures derived from unresponsive subjects and more specifically their association with consciousness (any subjective experience) or connectedness (specific experience of environmental stimuli).
Using published data generated through the UNderstanding Consciousness Connectedness and Intra-Operative Unresponsiveness Study (NCT03284307), we evaluated 10 previously published resting-state EEG-based measures that were derived using unresponsiveness as a proxy for unconsciousness. Measures were tested across dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation and natural sleep. These markers represent the complexity, connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, graph theory, and power spectrum measures.
Although many of the proposed markers were associated with consciousness per se (reported subjective experience), none were specific to consciousness alone; rather, each was also associated with connectedness (i.e. awareness of the environment). In addition, multiple markers showed no association with consciousness and were associated only with connectedness. Of the markers tested, loss of normalised-symbolic transfer entropy (front to back) was associated with connectedness across all three experimental conditions, whereas the transition from disconnected consciousness to unconsciousness was associated with significant decreases in permutation entropy and spectral exponent (P<0.05 for all conditions).
None of the proposed EEG-based neural correlates of unresponsiveness corresponded solely to consciousness, highlighting the need for a more conservative use of the term (un)consciousness when assessing unresponsive participants.

Prior to the onset of propofol-induced complete unconsciousness, degraded levels of behavioral responsiveness can be observed. However, a reliable index to monitor altered consciousness levels during anesthesia has not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we obtained 60-channel EEG data from 24 healthy participants during an ultra-slow propofol infusion protocol starting with an initial concentration of 1 μg/ml and a stepwise increase of 0.2 μg/ml in concentration. Consecutive auditory stimuli were delivered every 5 to 6 s, and the response time to the stimuli was used to assess the responsiveness levels. We calculated the spectral slope in a time-resolved manner by extracting 5-second EEG segments at each auditory stimulus and estimated their correlation with the corresponding response time. Our results demonstrated that during slow propofol infusion, the response time to external stimuli increased, while the EEG spectral slope, fitted at 15-45 Hz, became steeper, and a significant negative correlation was observed between them. Moreover, the spectral slope further steepened at deeper anesthetic levels and became flatter during anesthesia recovery. We verified these findings using an external dataset. Additionally, we found that the spectral slope of frontal electrodes over the prefrontal lobe had the best performance in predicting the response time. Overall, this study used a time-resolved analysis to suggest that the EEG spectral slope could reliably track continuously altered consciousness levels during propofol anesthesia. Furthermore, the frontal spectral slope may be a promising index for clinical monitoring of anesthesia depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37898378/

It is frequently used in the context of neuromuscular block. We have shown that a similar device, the Bispectral Index monitor (BIS), does not generate correct values in awake volunteers when neuromuscular blocking drugs are administered.
We replayed the EEGs recorded during awake paralysis from the original study to an Entropy monitor via a calibrated electronic playback system. Each EEG was replayed 30 times to evaluate the consistency of the Entropy output.
Both State Entropy and Response Entropy decreased during periods of neuromuscular block to values consistent with anaesthesia, despite there being no change in conscious state (State Entropy <60 in eight of nine rocuronium trials and nine of 10 suxamethonium trials). Entropy values did not return to pre-test levels until after the return of movement. Entropy did not generate exactly the same results when the same EEG was replayed multiple times, which is primarily because of a cyclical state within the Entropy system itself.
The GE Entropy™ monitor requires muscle activity to generate correct values in an awake subject. It could therefore be unreliable at detecting awareness in patients who have been given neuromuscular blocking drugs. In addition, Entropy does not generate the same result each time it is presented with the same EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37879777/

Multimodal outcome prediction is recommended 72 h post-arrest in still comatose patients, not considering initial rhythms. We investigated accuracy of outcome predictors in all comatose OHCA survivors, with a particular focus on shockable vs. non-shockable rhythms.
In this observational NORCAST sub-study, patients still comatose 72 h post-arrest were stratified by shockable vs. non-shockable rhythms for outcome prediction analyzes. Good outcome was defined as cerebral performance category 1-2 within 6 months. False positive rate (FPR) was used for poor and sensitivity for good outcome prediction accuracy.
Overall, 72/128 (56%) patients with shockable and 12/50 (24%) with non-shockable rhythms had good outcome (p < .001). For poor outcome prediction, absent pupillary light reflexes (PLR) and corneal reflexes (clinical predictors) 72 h after sedation withdrawal, PLR 96 h post-arrest, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), all had FPR <0.1% in both groups. Unreactive EEG and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) >60 μg/L 24-72 h post-arrest had better precision in shockable patients. For good outcome, the clinical predictors, SSEP and CT, had 86%-100% sensitivity in both groups. For NSE, sensitivity varied from 22% to 69% 24-72 h post-arrest. The outcome predictors indicated severe brain injury proportionally more often in patients with non-shockable than with shockable rhythms. For all patients, clinical predictors, CT, and SSEP, predicted poor and good outcome with high accuracy.

The neuronal injury caused by seizures in neonates often results in long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae. There are several options for anti-seizure medications (ASMs) in neonates. However, the ideal choice of first-, second- and third-line ASM is still unclear. Further, many other aspects of seizure management such as whether ASMs should be initiated for only-electrographic seizures and how long to continue the ASM once seizure control is achieved are elusive.
1. To assess whether any ASM is more or less effective than an alternative ASM (both ASMs used as first-, second- or third-line treatment) in achieving seizure control and improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with seizures. We analysed EEG-confirmed seizures and clinically-diagnosed seizures separately. 2. To assess maintenance therapy with ASM versus no maintenance therapy after achieving seizure control. We analysed EEG-confirmed seizures and clinically-diagnosed seizures separately. 3. To assess treatment of both clinical and electrographic seizures versus treatment of clinical seizures alone in neonates.
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Epistemonikos and three databases in May 2022 and June 2023. These searches were not limited other than by study design to trials.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included neonates with EEG-confirmed or clinically diagnosed seizures and compared (1) any ASM versus an alternative ASM, (2) maintenance therapy with ASM versus no maintenance therapy, and (3) treatment of clinical or EEG seizures versus treatment of clinical seizures alone.
Two review authors assessed trial eligibility, risk of bias and independently extracted data. We analysed treatment effects in individual trials and reported risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data, and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with respective 95% confidence interval (CI). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included 18 trials (1342 infants) in this review. Phenobarbital versus levetiracetam as first-line ASM in EEG-confirmed neonatal seizures (one trial) Phenobarbital is probably more effective than levetiracetam in achieving seizure control after first loading dose (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.63 to 3.30; 106 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and after maximal loading dose (RR 2.83, 95% CI 1.78 to 4.50; 106 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, we are uncertain about the effect of phenobarbital when compared to levetiracetam on mortality before discharge (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.52; 106 participants; very low-certainty evidence), requirement of mechanical ventilation (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.91; 106 participants; very low-certainty evidence), sedation/drowsiness (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.44; 106 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and epilepsy post-discharge (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.76; 106 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The trial did not report on mortality or neurodevelopmental disability at 18 to 24 months. Phenobarbital versus phenytoin as first-line ASM in EEG-confirmed neonatal seizures (one trial) We are uncertain about the effect of phenobarbital versus phenytoin on achieving seizure control after maximal loading dose of ASM (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.72; 59 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The trial did not report on mortality or neurodevelopmental disability at 18 to 24 months. Maintenance therapy with ASM versus no maintenance therapy in clinically diagnosed neonatal seizures (two trials) We are uncertain about the effect of short-term maintenance therapy with ASM versus no maintenance therapy during the hospital stay (but discontinued before discharge) on the risk of repeat seizures before hospital discharge (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.01; 373 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Maintenance therapy with ASM compared to no maintenance therapy may have little or no effect on mortality before discharge (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.22; 373 participants; low-certainty evidence), mortality at 18 to 24 months (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.61; 111 participants; low-certainty evidence), neurodevelopmental disability at 18 to 24 months (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.13 to 6.12; 108 participants; low-certainty evidence) and epilepsy post-discharge (RR 3.18, 95% CI 0.69 to 14.72; 126 participants; low-certainty evidence). Treatment of both clinical and electrographic seizures versus treatment of clinical seizures alone in neonates (two trials) Treatment of both clinical and electrographic seizures when compared to treating clinical seizures alone may have little or no effect on seizure burden during hospitalisation (MD -1871.16, 95% CI -4525.05 to 782.73; 68 participants; low-certainty evidence), mortality before discharge (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.27; 68 participants; low-certainty evidence) and epilepsy post-discharge (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.12 to 4.73; 35 participants; low-certainty evidence). The trials did not report on mortality or neurodevelopmental disability at 18 to 24 months. We report data from the most important comparisons here; readers are directed to Results and Summary of Findings tables for all comparisons.
Phenobarbital as a first-line ASM is probably more effective than levetiracetam in achieving seizure control after the first loading dose and after the maximal loading dose of ASM (moderate-certainty evidence). Phenobarbital + bumetanide may have little or no difference in achieving seizure control when compared to phenobarbital alone (low-certainty evidence). Limited data and very low-certainty evidence preclude us from drawing any reasonable conclusion on the effect of using one ASM versus another on other short- and long-term outcomes. In neonates who achieve seizure control after the first loading dose of phenobarbital, maintenance therapy compared to no maintenance ASM may have little or no effect on all-cause mortality before discharge, mortality by 18 to 24 months, neurodevelopmental disability by 18 to 24 months and epilepsy post-discharge (low-certainty evidence). In neonates with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, treatment of both clinical and electrographic seizures when compared to treating clinical seizures alone may have little or no effect on seizure burden during hospitalisation, all-cause mortality before discharge and epilepsy post-discharge (low-certainty evidence). All findings of this review apply only to term and late preterm neonates. We need well-designed RCTs for each of the three objectives of this review to improve the precision of the results. These RCTs should use EEG to diagnose seizures and should be adequately powered to assess long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. We need separate RCTs evaluating the choice of ASM in preterm infants.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37873971/

It also enables monitoring of after-discharges and seizures with EEG during functional brain mapping with electrical stimulation. When seizures or after-discharges are present, they complicate accurate interpretation of the mapping strategy to outline the brain's eloquent function and can affect the surgical procedure. Recurrent seizures during surgery requires urgent treatment and, when occurring during awake craniotomy, often leads to premature termination of brain mapping due to post-ictal confusion or sedation from acute rescue therapy. There are mixed results in studies on efficacy with iECoG in patients with epilepsy and brain tumors influencing survival and functional outcomes following surgery. Commercially available electrode arrays have inherent limitations. These could be improved with customization potentially leading to greater precision in safe and maximal resection of brain tumors. Few studies have assessed customized electrode grid designs as an alternative to commercially available products. Higher density electrode grids with intercontact distances less than 1 cm improve spatial delineation of electrophysiologic sources, including epileptiform activity, electrographic seizures, and afterdischarges on iECoG during functional brain mapping. In response to the shortcomings of current iECoG grid technologies, we designed and developed a novel higher-density hollow circular electrode grid array. The 360-degree iECoG monitoring capability allows continuous EEG recording during surgical intervention through the aperture with and without electrical stimulation mapping. Compared with linear strip electrodes that are commonly used for iECoG during surgery, the circular grid demonstrates significant benefits in brain tumor surgery. This includes quicker recovery of post-operative motor deficits (2.4 days versus 9 days, p = 0.05), more extensive tumor resection (92.0% versus 77.6%, p = 0.003), lesser reduction in Karnofsky Performance scale postoperatively (-2 versus -11.6, p = 0.007), and more sensitivity to recording afterdischarges. In this narrative review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of commercially available recording devices in the operating room and focus on the usefulness of the higher-density circular grid.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37871586/

Monitoring electroencephalography (EEG) to adjust anesthetic management has gained interest as a strategy to mitigate POD.

Meanwhile, the Con side advocates that the use of EEG to reduce POD is not yet certain, citing that there is a lack of evidence that associations between anesthetic depth and POD represent causal relationships. The Con side also contends that the ideal EEG signatures to guide anesthetic titration are currently unknown, and the potential benefits of reduced anesthesia levels may be outweighed by the risks of potentially insufficient anesthetic administration.

EEG can be processed into quantitative EEG (QEEG), but limited data exist on the range of QEEG for normal term neonates during wakefulness and sleep, baseline information that would be useful to determine changes during sedation or anesthesia. We aimed to determine the range of QEEG in neonates during awake, active sleep and quiet sleep states, and identified the ones best at discriminating between the three states. Normal neonatal EEG from 37 to 46 weeks were analyzed and classified as awake, quiet sleep, or active sleep. After processing and artifact removal, total power, power ratio, coherence, entropy, and spectral edge frequency (SEF) 50 and 90 were calculated. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the QEEG in each of the three states. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess discriminatory ability of QEEG. 30 neonates were analyzed. QEEG were different between awake vs asleep states, but similar between active vs quiet sleep states. Entropy beta, delta2 power %, coherence delta2, and SEF50 were best at discriminating awake vs active sleep. Entropy beta had the highest AUC-ROC ≥ 0.84. Entropy beta, entropy delta1, theta power %, and SEF50 were best at discriminating awake vs quiet sleep. All had AUC-ROC ≥ 0.78. In active sleep vs quiet sleep, theta power % had highest AUC-ROC > 0.69, lower than the other comparisons. We determined the QEEG range in healthy neonates in different states of consciousness. Entropy beta and SEF50 were best at discriminating between awake and sleep states. QEEG were not as good at discriminating between quiet and active sleep.

The influence of depth of sedation indices such as the bispectral index (BIS) generated by the processed electroencephalogram (pEEG) machine to guide the management of anesthetic depth of sedation on postoperative outcome remains controversial. This research was designed to decide whether an anesthetic agent exposure determined by raw electroencephalogram (rEEG) can influence anesthetic management and cause different EEG patterns and affect various patient outcomes.
A total of 141 participants aged ≥ 60 years undergoing abdominal major surgery were randomized to rEEG-guided anesthesia or routine care group. The rEEG-guided anesthesia group had propofol titrated to keep the rEEG waveform at the C-D sedation depth during surgery, while in the routine care group the anesthetist was masked to the patient's rEEG waveform and guided the anesthetic management only through clinical experience. The primary outcome was the presence of postoperative complications, the secondary outcomes included intraoperative anesthetic management and different EEG patterns.
There were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of postoperative respiratory, circulatory, neurological and gastrointestinal complications. Further EEG analysis revealed that lower frontal alpha power was significantly associated with a higher incidence of POD, and that rEEG-guidance not only reduced the duration of deeper anesthesia in patients with lower frontal alpha power, but also allowed patients with higher frontal alpha power to receive deeper and more appropriate depths of anesthesia than in the routine care group.
In elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, rEEG-guided anesthesia did not reduce the incidence of postoperative respiratory, circulatory, neurological and gastrointestinal complications. rEEG-guided anesthesia management reduced the duration of intraoperative BS in patients and the duration of over-deep sedation in patients with lower frontal alpha waves under anesthesia, and there was a strong association between lower frontal alpha power under anesthesia and the development of POD. rEEG-guided anesthesia may improve the prognosis of patients with vulnerable brains by improving the early identification of frail elderly patients and providing them with a more effective individualized anesthetic managements.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37803259/

One hundred and thirty patients between 3 and 6 years of age undergoing dental surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in the study. Real-time electroencephalogram data were recorded at four different time points from end of anesthetics administration (T1), end of surgery (T2), extubation (T3), and response (eye opening, movement) to verbal stimulation (T4). Each patient was assessed for emergence delirium using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale. Receiver operating characteristics curves and the associated areas under the curves were computed to analyze the ability of wavelet index, pain threshold index, anxiety index, and comfort index to predict emergence delirium.
One hundred and sixteen patients were included for final analysis. During recovery from general anesthesia, brain status parameters increased significantly from T1 (wavelet index, 59.5 ± 6.2; pain threshold index, 61.7 ± 5.3; anxiety index, 9.2 ± 2.5; comfort index, 21.6 ± 8.7) to T4 (wavelet index, 67.4 ± 9.4; pain threshold index, 73.2 ± 9.1; anxiety index, 38.6 ± 11.2; comfort index, 66.1 ± 16.5; p < .001). To predict emergence delirium, areas under the curves [95% CI] for anxiety index were 0.84 [0.75-0.93] (p < .001), and comfort index was 0.89 [0.81-0.96] (p < .001). The Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale scores of 37 patients were higher than 10 indicating emergence delirium, and the incidence of emergence delirium was 31.90%. The sensitivity and specificity of anxiety index with corresponding cutoff values in predicting emergence delirium were 73.0% and 89.9%, and the sensitivity and specificity of comfort index in predicting emergence delirium were 91.9% and 83.5%. The best cutoff values for anxiety index and comfort index to predict emergence delirium were 46.5 and 68.5, respectively. The areas under the curves [95% CI] of wavelet index to predict emergence delirium were 0.43 [0.31-0.35] (p = .27), while the areas under the curves [95% CI] of pain threshold index to predict emergence delirium were 0.49 [0.37-0.62] (p = .73).
Both anxiety index and comfort index derived from electroencephalogram wavelet analysis were associated with emergence delirium in pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia for dental surgery. Wavelet index and pain threshold index were not associated with emergence delirium during general anesthesia for dental surgery in children.

In daily clinical practice, the EEG is recorded from the forehead and available neuromonitoring systems translate the EEG information into an index inversely correlating with the anesthetic level. Electrode placement on the forehead can lead to an influence of electromyographic (EMG) activity on the recorded signal in patients without neuromuscular blockade (NMB). A separation of EEG and EMG in the clinical setting is difficult because both signals share an overlapping frequency range. Previous research showed that indices decreased when EMG was absent in awake volunteers with NMB. Here, we investigated to what extent the indices changed, when EEG recorded during surgery with NMB agents was superimposed with EMG.
We recorded EMG from the flexor muscles of the forearm of 18 healthy volunteers with a CONOX monitor during different activity settings, that is, during contraction using a grip strengthener and during active diversion (relaxed arm). Both the forehead and forearm muscles are striated muscles. The recorded EMG was normalized by z -scoring and added to the EEG in different amplification steps. The EEG was recorded during anesthesia with NMB. We replayed these combined EEG and EMG signals to different neuromonitoring systems, that is, bispectral index (BIS), CONOX with qCON and qNOX, and entropy module with state entropy (SE) and response entropy (RE). We used the Friedman test and a Tukey-Kramer post hoc correction for statistical analysis.
The indices of all neuromonitoring systems significantly increased when the EEG was superimposed with the contraction EMG and with high EMG amplitudes, the monitors returned invalid values, representative of artifact contamination. When replaying the EEG being superimposed with ""relaxed"" EMG, the qCON and BIS showed significant increases, but not SE and RE. For SE and RE, we observed an increased number of invalid values.
With our approach, we could show that EMG activity during contraction and resting state can influence the neuromonitoring systems. This knowledge may help to improve EEG-based patient monitoring in the future and help the anesthesiologist to use the neuromonitoring systems with more knowledge regarding their function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37756246/

We provide an evidence-based guide for implementing multimodal anaesthesia, encompassing drug combinations, dosages, and EEG monitoring techniques, to ensure reliable intraoperative anaesthesia while minimizing adverse effects and improving patient outcomes.
Opioid-free and multimodal general anaesthesia have significantly reduced opioid addiction and chronic postoperative pain. However, the evidence supporting the effectiveness of these approaches is limited. This review attempts to integrate research from broader neuroscientific fields to generate new clinical hypotheses. It discusses the correlation between high-dose intraoperative opioids and increased postoperative opioid consumption and their impact on pain indices and readmission rates. Additionally, it explores the relationship between multimodal anaesthesia and pain processing models and investigates the potential effects of nonpharmacological interventions on preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain.
The integration of EEG monitoring is crucial for guiding adequate multimodal anaesthesia and preventing excessive anaesthesia dosing. Furthermore, the review investigates the impact of combining regional and opioid-sparing general anaesthesia on perioperative EEG readings and anaesthetic depth. The findings have significant implications for clinical practice in optimizing multimodal anaesthesia techniques (Supplementary Digital Content 1: Video Abstract, http://links.lww.com/COAN/A96 ).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37724595/
37673590,Development of a Bispectral index score prediction model based on an interpretable deep learning algorithm.,Artificial intelligence in medicine,2023,"Hwang E, Park HS, Kim HS, Kim JY, Jeong H, Kim J, Kim SH","Proper maintenance of hypnosis is crucial for ensuring the safety of patients undergoing surgery. Accordingly, indicators, such as the Bispectral index (BIS), have been developed to monitor hypnotic levels. However, the black-box nature of the algorithm coupled with the hardware makes it challenging to understand the underlying mechanisms of the algorithms and integrate them with other monitoring systems, thereby limiting their use.
We propose an interpretable deep learning model that forecasts BIS values 25 s in advance using 30 s electroencephalogram (EEG) data.
The proposed model utilized EEG data as a predictor, which is then decomposed into amplitude and phase components using fast Fourier Transform. An attention mechanism was applied to interpret the importance of these components in predicting BIS. The predictability of the model was evaluated on both regression and binary classification tasks, where the former involved predicting a continuous BIS value, and the latter involved classifying a dichotomous status at a BIS value of 60. To evaluate the interpretability of the model, we analyzed the attention values expressed in the amplitude and phase components according to five ranges of BIS values. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using datasets collected from two separate medical institutions.
The proposed model achieved excellent performance on both the internal and external validation datasets. The model achieved a root-mean-square error of 6.614 for the regression task, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.937 for the binary classification task. Interpretability analysis provided insight into the relationship between EEG frequency components and BIS values. Specifically, the attention mechanism revealed that higher BIS values were associated with increased amplitude attention values in high-frequency bands and increased phase attention values in various frequency bands. This finding is expected to facilitate a more profound understanding of the BIS prediction mechanism, thereby contributing to the advancement of anesthesia technologies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37673590/

Despite substantial work, we are still unsure which brain regions are involved and how they are impacted when consciousness is disrupted. Using intracranial recordings and direct electrical stimulation, we mapped global, network, and regional involvement during wake vs. arousable unconsciousness (sleep) vs. non-arousable unconsciousness (propofol-induced general anesthesia). Information integration and complex processing we`re reduced, while variability increased in any type of unconscious state. These changes were more pronounced during anesthesia than sleep and involved different cortical engagement. During sleep, changes were mostly uniformly distributed across the brain, whereas during anesthesia, the prefrontal cortex was the most disrupted, suggesting that the lack of arousability during anesthesia results not from just altered overall physiology but from a disconnection between the prefrontal and other brain areas. These findings provide direct evidence for different neural dynamics during loss of consciousness compared with loss of arousability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37659409/
37616326,Predictors of Low Risk for Delirium during Anesthesia Emergence.,Anesthesiology,2023,"Dragovic S, Schneider G, García PS, Hinzmann D, Sleigh J, Kratzer S, Kreuzer M","Processed electroencephalography (EEG) is used to monitor the level of anesthesia, and it has shown the potential to predict the occurrence of delirium. While emergence trajectories of relative EEG band power identified post hoc show promising results in predicting a risk for a delirium, they are not easily transferable into an online predictive application. This article describes a low-resource and easily applicable method to differentiate between patients at high risk and low risk for delirium, with patients at low risk expected to show decreasing EEG power during emergence.
This study includes data from 169 patients (median age, 61 yr [49, 73]) who underwent surgery with general anesthesia maintained with propofol, sevoflurane, or desflurane. The data were derived from a previously published study. The investigators chose a single frontal channel, calculated the total and spectral band power from the EEG and calculated a linear regression model to observe the parameters' change during anesthesia emergence, described as slope. The slope of total power and single band power was correlated with the occurrence of delirium.
Of 169 patients, 32 (19%) showed delirium. Patients whose total EEG power diminished the most during emergence were less likely to screen positive for delirium in the postanesthesia care unit. A positive slope in total power and band power evaluated by using a regression model was associated with a higher risk ratio (total, 2.83 [95% CI, 1.46 to 5.51]; alpha/beta band, 7.79 [95% CI, 2.24 to 27.09]) for delirium. Furthermore, a negative slope in multiple bands during emergence was specific for patients without delirium and allowed definition of a test for patients at low risk.
This study developed an easily applicable exploratory method to analyze a single frontal EEG channel and to identify patterns specific for patients at low risk for delirium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37616326/

We investigated cortical excitability in response to dexmedetomidine, the effects of which are not fully known.
We recorded transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and EEG in frontal and parietal cortex of 20 healthy subjects undergoing dexmedetomidine sedation in four conditions (baseline, light sedation, deep sedation, recovery). We used the first component (0-30 ms) of the TMS-evoked potential (TEP) to measure cortical excitability (amplitude), slope, and positive and negative peak latencies (collectively, TEP indices). We used generalised linear mixed models to test the effect of condition, brain region, and responsiveness on TEP indices.
Compared with baseline, amplitude in the frontal cortex increased by 6.52 μV (P<0.001) in light sedation, 4.55 μV (P=0.003) in deep sedation, and 5.03 μV (P<0.001) in recovery. Amplitude did not change in the parietal cortex. Compared with baseline, slope increased in all conditions (P<0.02) in the frontal but not parietal cortex. The frontal cortex showed 5.73 μV higher amplitude (P<0.001), 0.63 μV ms

37590801,Pro-Con Debate: Should All General Anesthesia Be Done Using Target-Controlled Propofol Infusion Guided by Objective Monitoring of Depth of Anesthesia?,Anesthesia and analgesia,2023,"Schnider TW, Nieuwenhuijs-Moeke GJ, Beck-Schimmer B, Hemmerling TM","In this Pro-Con commentary article, we discuss whether all general anesthesia should be done using target-controlled propofol anesthesia guided by monitoring of depth of anesthesia. This is an ongoing debate since more than 25 years, representing a scientific, cultural as well as geographical divide in the anesthesia community. The Pro side argues that total intravenous anesthesia causes less postoperative nausea and higher patient satisfaction than anesthesia using volatile anesthetics. Target-controlled infusion (TCI) of anesthetic agents allows for better titration of intravenous anesthesia using pharmacokinetic models. Processed EEG monitors, such as bispectral index monitoring, allows for better assessing the effect of TCI anesthesia than solely assessment of clinical parameters, such as ECG or blood pressure. The combination of TCI propofol and objective depth of anesthesia monitoring allows creating a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile for each patient. Finally, anesthesia using volatile anesthetics poses health risks for healthcare professionals and contributes to greenhouse effect. The Con side argues that for procedures accompanied with ischemia and reperfusion injury of an organ or tissue and for patients suffering from a severe inflammation' the use of volatile anesthetics might well have its advantages above propofol. In times of sudden shortage of drugs, volatile anesthetics can overcome the restriction in the operating theater or even on the intensive care unit, which is another advantage. Volatile anesthetics can be used for induction of anesthesia when IV access is impossible, end-tidal measurements of volatile anesthetic concentration allows confirmation that patients receive anesthetics. Taking environmental considerations into account, both propofol and volatile anesthetics bear certain harm to the environment, be it as waste product or as greenhouse gases. The authors therefore suggest to carefully considering advantages and disadvantages for each patient in its according environment. A well-balanced choice based on the available literature is recommended. The authors recommend careful consideration of advantages and disadvantages of each technique when tailoring an anesthetic to meet patient needs. Where appropriate, anesthesia providers are encouraged to account for unique features of anesthetic drug behavior, patient-reported and observed postoperative outcomes, and economic and environmental considerations when choosing any of the 2 described techniques.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37590801/

Since the advent of ECT, extensive research has been performed to identify the predictive factors for response to ECT. In recent decades, postictal suppression on an electroencephalogram (EEG) has been considered a potential predictor of response to ECT. We aimed to investigate the direct association between postictal suppression and the therapeutic effects of ECT. In this systematic review, all articles in the field of the association between postictal suppression and the therapeutic effects of ECT published between 1990 and 2021 were identified.

Of all retrieved articles, eight studies, including four retrospective cohort articles and four clinical trials, met the inclusion criteria for further analyses. The findings of this study showed a significant association between postictal suppression and the therapeutic efficacy of ECT. Factors such as electrode placement, tachycardia, type of anesthetic agent, and EEG amplitude were also directly related to postictal suppression and the efficacy of ECT. Postictal suppression on EEG can be considered a predictor of response to ECT. To increase the effectiveness of treatment with ECT and increase postictal suppression, factors including electrode placement, tachycardia, type of anesthesia, and EEG amplitude should be considered, which highlights the need for further research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37587610/

The perturbational complexity index (PCI) has been used in humans and rodents to distinguish conscious from unconscious states based on the global cortical responses (recorded by electroencephalography, EEG) to local cortical stimulation (CS). However, it is unclear how different cortical layers respond to CS and contribute to the resulting intra- and inter-areal cortical connectivity and PCI. A detailed investigation of the local dynamics is needed to understand the basis for PCI. We hypothesized that the complexity level of global cortical responses (PCI) correlates with layer-specific activity and connectivity. We tested this idea by measuring global cortical dynamics and layer-specific activity in the somatosensory cortex (S1) of mice, combining cortical electrical stimulation in deep motor cortex, global electrocorticography (ECoG) and local laminar recordings from layers 1-6 in S1, during wakefulness and general anaesthesia (sevoflurane).

We have shown that the potential for improving the pharmacokinetic model is minimal. The drug titration paradox revealed that titration challenges the classical relationship between drug dose and effect in both individuals and the population. We hypothesised that dynamic factors during surgery beyond the static genetic, epigenetic, and other factors such as age, height, and weight affect the necessary dose. We compared the variability of measured end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations with predicted effect-site propofol concentrations when titrated to a BIS range of 40-60, with the hypothesis that the variability in measured sevoflurane concentrations would not be less than the variability in estimated propofol concentrations.
Clinical data from 2280 surgical procedures >1 h in duration were included in the analysis. Anaesthesia with sevoflurane or propofol was based on an institutional protocol. The titration performance for both drugs was assessed by comparing BIS values 30 min after skin incision. The variability of the required concentrations at the same time point was calculated and compared.
The achieved 30-min post-incision BIS ranges were not significantly different for sevoflurane or propofol TCI (30 [99% CI: 28-33] and 31 [99% CI: 27-36], respectively). The variability of sevoflurane concentrations was not significantly different from measured predicted propofol concentrations during BIS-guided anaesthesia (normalized concentration range of 0.89 [99% CI: 0.78-0.99] and 0.93 [99% CI 0.87-1.02).

We first examined plasma levels and adverse neurological effects of E2730 in healthy Wistar rats. Adult male rats were implanted with osmotic pumps delivering either 10, 20, or 100 mg/kg/day of E2730 subcutaneously for 1 week. Blood sampling and behavioral assessments were performed at several timepoints. We next examined whether E2730 suppressed seizures in rats with chronic MTLE. These rats were exposed to kainic acid-induced status epilepticus, and 9 weeks later, when chronic epilepsy was established, were assigned to receive one of the three doses of E2730 or vehicle for 1 week in a randomized crossover design. Continuous video-electroencephalographic monitoring was acquired during the treatment period to evaluate epileptic seizures.
Plasma levels following continuous infusion of E2730 showed a clear dose-related increase in concentration. The drug was well tolerated at all doses, and any sedation or neuromotor impairment was mild and transient, resolving within 48 h of treatment initiation. Remarkably, E2730 treatment in chronically epileptic rats led to seizure suppression in a dose-dependent manner, with 65% of rats becoming seizure-free at the highest dose tested. Mean seizure class did not differ between the treatment groups.
This study shows that continuous subcutaneous infusion of E2730 over 7 days results in a marked, dose-dependent suppression of spontaneous recurrent seizures, with minimal adverse neurological effects, in a rat model of chronic MTLE.

However, it has been shown that the focus on specific ordinal patterns instead of all of them produced similar results. Moreover, parameter settings influence the resulting PeEn value. We evaluated the impact of the embedding dimension m and the length of the EEG segment on the resulting PeEn. Moreover, we analysed the probability distributions of monotonous and non-occurring ordinal patterns in different parameter settings. We based our analyses on simulated data as well as on EEG recordings from volunteers, obtained during stable anaesthesia levels at defined, individualised concentrations. The results of the analysis on the simulated data show a dependence of PeEn on different influencing factors such as window length and embedding dimension. With the EEG data, we demonstrated that the probability P of monotonous patterns performs like PeEn in lower embedding dimension (m = 3, AUC = 0.88, [0.7, 1] in both), whereas the probability P of non-occurring patterns outperforms both methods in higher embedding dimensions (m = 5, PeEn: AUC = 0.91, [0.77, 1]; P(non-occurring patterns): AUC = 1, [1, 1]).

However, prior studies using qEEG in NE were limited in their generalizability due to individualized techniques for calculating qEEG features or labor-intensive pre-selection of EEG data. We piloted a fully automated method using commercially available software to calculate the suppression ratio (SR), absolute delta power, and relative delta, theta, alpha, and beta power from EEG of neonates undergoing 72 h of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) for NE between April 20, 2018, and November 4, 2019. We investigated the association of qEEG with degree of encephalopathy (modified Sarnat score), severity of neuroimaging abnormalities following TH (National Institutes of Child Health and Development Neonatal Research Network [NICHD-NRN] score), and presence of seizures. Thirty out of 38 patients met inclusion criteria. A more severe modified Sarnat score was associated with higher SR during all phases of TH, lower absolute delta power during all phases except rewarming, and lower relative delta power during the last 24 h of TH. In 21 patients with neuroimaging data, a worse NICHD-NRN score was associated with higher SR, lower absolute delta power, and higher relative beta power during all phases. QEEG features were not significantly associated with the presence of seizures after correction for multiple comparisons. Our results are consistent with those of prior studies using qEEG in NE and support automated qEEG analysis as an accessible, generalizable method for generating biomarkers of NE and response to TH. Additionally, we found evidence of an immature relative frequency composition in neonates with more severe brain injury, suggesting that automated qEEG analysis may have a use in the assessment of brain maturity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37467736/

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a more mechanism-based parameter of EEG analysis (symbolic transfer entropy, STE) can separate responsive from unresponsive patients better than a strictly probabilistic parameter (permutation entropy, PE) under clinical conditions. In this prospective single-center study, the EEG of 60 surgical ASA I-III patients was recorded perioperatively. During induction of and emergence from anesthesia, patients were asked to squeeze the investigators' hand every 15s. Time of loss of responsiveness (LoR) during induction and return of responsiveness (RoR) during emergence from anesthesia were registered. PE and STE were calculated at -15s and +30s of LoR and RoR and their ability to separate responsive from unresponsive patients was evaluated using accuracy statistics. 56 patients were included in the final analysis. STE and PE values decreased during anesthesia induction and increased during emergence. Intra-individual consistency was higher during induction than during emergence.

With approximately > 234 million major surgical procedures performed annually worldwide [4], this suggests that > 70 million surgeries are performed on older adults across the globe each year. The most common postoperative complications seen in these older surgical patients are perioperative neurocognitive disorders including postoperative delirium, which are associated with an increased risk for mortality [5], greater economic burden [6, 7], and greater risk for developing long-term cognitive decline [8] such as Alzheimer's disease and/or related dementias (ADRD). Thus, anesthesia, surgery, and postoperative hospitalization have been viewed as a biological ""stress test"" for the aging brain, in which postoperative delirium indicates a failed stress test and consequent risk for later cognitive decline (see Fig. 3). Further, it has been hypothesized that interventions that prevent postoperative delirium might reduce the risk of long-term cognitive decline. Recent advances suggest that rather than waiting for the development of postoperative delirium to indicate whether a patient ""passed"" or ""failed"" this stress test, the status of the brain can be monitored in real-time via electroencephalography (EEG) in the perioperative period. Beyond the traditional intraoperative use of EEG monitoring for anesthetic titration, perioperative EEG may be a viable tool for identifying waveforms indicative of reduced brain integrity and potential risk for postoperative delirium and long-term cognitive decline. In principle, research incorporating routine perioperative EEG monitoring may provide insight into neuronal patterns of dysfunction associated with risk of postoperative delirium, long-term cognitive decline, or even specific types of aging-related neurodegenerative disease pathology. This research would accelerate our understanding of which waveforms or neuronal patterns necessitate diagnostic workup and intervention in the perioperative period, which could potentially reduce postoperative delirium and/or dementia risk. Thus, here we present recommendations for the use of perioperative EEG as a ""predictor"" of delirium and perioperative cognitive decline in older surgical patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37436580/

Variational mode decomposition (VMD) searches for IMFs by optimizing the bandwidth to a narrow band with the [Formula: see text] norm while preserving the online estimated central frequency. In this study, we applied VMD to the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during general anesthesia. Using a bispectral index monitor, EEGs were recorded from 10 adult surgical patients (the median age: 47.0, and the percentile range: 27.0-59.3 years) who were anesthetized with sevoflurane. We created an application named EEG Mode Decompositor, which decomposes the recorded EEG into IMFs and displays the Hilbert spectrogram. Over the 30-min recovery from general anesthesia, the median (25-75 percentile range) bispectral index increased from 47.1 (42.2-50.4) to 97.4 (96.5-97.6), and the central frequencies of IMF-1 showed a significant change from 0.4 (0.2-0.5) Hz to 0.2 (0.1-0.3) Hz.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether this reduction in cerebral perfusion is significant enough to alter brain function, as assessed by electroencephalography (EEG).
Following ethics approval and parental informed consent, 11 infants (0-3 months) scheduled to undergo inguinal hernia repair were included in the study. EEG electrodes (using nine electrodes according to the 10-20 standard) were applied following anesthesia induction. Following a 5 min baseline period, a caudal block was performed (1.5 mL/kg), whereafter the EEG, hemodynamic, and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy responses were followed during a 20 min observation period that was divided into four 5 min segments. Special attention was given to alterations in delta power activity since this may indicate cerebral ischemia.
All 11 infants displayed transient EEG changes, mainly represented by increased relative delta power, during the initial 5-10 min postinjection. The observed changes had returned close to baseline values 15 min postinjection. Heart rate and blood pressure remained stable throughout the study.
A high-volume caudal block appears to increase intracranial pressure, thereby reducing cerebral blood flow, to the extent that it transiently will affect cerebral function as assessed by EEG (increased delta power activity) in approximately 90% of small infants.

However, it is not clear whether the intra-operative administration of ketamine would affect emergence under sevoflurane anesthesia. To investigate this effect, we designed this trial.
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we enrolled 44 female patients aged 18-60 who were scheduled to elective laparoscopic gynecological surgeries. All patients were randomly assigned to saline or s-ketamine group. In s-ketamine group, patients received 0.125 mg/kg s-ketamine 30 min after the start of surgery. In saline group, patients were administered the same volume of saline. Sevoflurane and remifentanil were used to maintain general anesthesia. The primary outcome was emergence time. We also assessed postoperative agitation, cognitive function, and delirium. In addition, we collected and analyzed prefrontal electroencephalogram (EEG) during and after general anesthesia.
There were no significant differences in emergence time between s-ketamine group and saline group (10.80 ± 3.77 min vs. 10.00 ± 2.78 min, P = 0.457). Neither postoperative agitation (4 [3, 4] vs. 4 [3, 4], P = 0.835) nor cognitive function (25.84 ± 2.69 vs. 25.55 ± 2.19, P = 0.412) differed between groups. No postoperative delirium was observed in either group. Subanesthetic s-ketamine resulted in active EEG with decreased power of slow (-0.35 ± 1.13 dB vs. -1.63 ± 1.03 dB, P = 0.003), delta (-0.22 ± 1.11 dB vs. -1.32 ± 1.09 dB, P = 0.011) and alpha (-0.31 ± 0.71 dB vs. -1.71 ± 1.34 dB, P = 0.0003) waves and increased power of beta-gamma bands (-0.30 ± 0.89 dB vs. 4.20 ± 2.08 dB, P < 0.0001) during sevoflurane anesthesia, as well as an increased alpha peak frequency (-0.16 ± 0.48 Hz vs. 0.31 ± 0.73 Hz, P = 0.026). EEG patterns did not differ during the recovery period after emergence between groups.
Ketamine administered during sevoflurane anesthesia had no apparent influence on emergence time in young and middle-aged female patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.

Retrospective observational study.
Single university hospital.
A total of 803 adult patients without documentation of a previous stroke, who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) between July 2016 and January 2018.
The LIR index was calculated retrospectively from the patients' EEG database.
LIR was analyzed intraoperatively every 10 seconds and compared among patients with postoperative stroke, patients with delirium, and patients without documented neurologic complications, during 5 key periods, each lasting10 minutes: (1) surgery start, (2) before CPB, (3) on CPB, (4) after CPB, and (5) surgery end. After cardiac surgery, 31 patients suffered from stroke; 48 patients were diagnosed with delirium; and 724 had no documented neurologic complications. Patients with stroke demonstrated a decrease in LIR index between the start of surgery and the postbypass period of 0.08 (0.01, 0.36 [21]; median and [interquartile range {IQR}]; valid EEG samples); whereas there was no similar decrease in the no-dysfunction group (-0.04 [-0.13, 0.04; {551}], p < 0.0001).

As anesthetic dose increases, the EEG signal changes in ways that give clues to the level of unconsciousness; the network mechanisms of these changes are only partially understood. Here, we construct a biophysical thalamocortical network involving brain stem influences that reproduces transitions in dynamics seen in the EEG involving the evolution of the power and frequency of alpha/low-beta and slow rhythm, as well as their interactions. Our model suggests that propofol engages thalamic spindle and cortical sleep mechanisms to elicit persistent alpha/low-beta and slow rhythms, respectively. The thalamocortical network fluctuates between two mutually exclusive states on the timescale of seconds. One state is characterized by continuous alpha/low-beta-frequency spiking in thalamus (C-state), whereas in the other, thalamic alpha spiking is interrupted by periods of co-occurring thalamic and cortical silence (I-state). In the I-state, alpha colocalizes to the peak of the slow oscillation; in the C-state, there is a variable relationship between an alpha/beta rhythm and the slow oscillation. The C-state predominates near loss of consciousness; with increasing dose, the proportion of time spent in the I-state increases, recapitulating EEG phenomenology. Cortical synchrony drives the switch to the I-state by changing the nature of the thalamocortical feedback. Brain stem influence on the strength of thalamocortical feedback mediates the amount of cortical synchrony. Our model implicates loss of low-beta, cortical synchrony, and coordinated thalamocortical silent periods as contributing to the unconscious state.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37314079/

Growing evidence suggests the useful information on brain states is to be found in the higher-order temporal structure of these sequences. Instead of focusing on transition probabilities, here we propose ""Microsynt"", a method designed to highlight higher-order interactions that form a preliminary step towards understanding the syntax of microstate sequences of any length and complexity. Microsynt extracts an optimal vocabulary of ""words"" based on the length and complexity of the full sequence of microstates. Words are then sorted into classes of entropy and their representativeness within each class is statistically compared with surrogate and theoretical vocabularies. We applied the method on EEG data previously collected from healthy subjects undergoing propofol anesthesia, and compared their ""fully awake"" (BASE) and ""fully unconscious"" (DEEP) conditions. Results show that microstate sequences, even at rest, are not random but tend to behave in a more predictable way, favoring simpler sub-sequences, or ""words"". Contrary to high-entropy words, lowest-entropy binary microstate loops are prominent and favored on average 10 times more than what is theoretically expected. Progressing from BASE to DEEP, the representation of low-entropy words increases while that of high-entropy words decreases. During the awake state, sequences of microstates tend to be attracted towards ""A - B - C"" microstate hubs, and most prominently A - B binary loops. Conversely, with full unconsciousness, sequences of microstates are attracted towards ""C - D - E"" hubs, and most prominently C - E binary loops, confirming the putative relation of microstates A and B to externally-oriented cognitive processes and microstate C and E to internally-generated mental activity. Microsynt can form a syntactic signature of microstate sequences that can be used to reliably differentiate two or more conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37286153/

We distributed a web-based survey through professional societies, including the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), Neurocritical Care Society (NCS), American Epilepsy Society (AES), Neuro Anesthesia and Critical Care Society (NACCS), and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), and via research contacts. We asked respondents about practice experience and experience using KD as a treatment for SE. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests were used to analyze the results.
Of 156 respondents, 80% of physicians and 18% of non-physicians reported experience with KD for SE. Anticipated difficulty in achieving ketosis (36.3%), lack of expertise (24.2%), and lack of resources (20.9%) were identified as the most important barriers limiting the utilization of KD. The absence of dietitians (37.1%) or pharmacists (25.7%) support was the most important missing resource. Reasons for stopping KD included perceived ineffectiveness (29.1%), difficulty achieving ketosis (24.6%), and side effects (17.3%).

Although systematic data are lacking regarding the immediate neurologic complications of this procedure, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) can be a valuable tool to detect real-time neurologic changes and prompt intervention(s) during DRG-S performed under general anesthesia and deep sedation.
In our single-center case series, we performed multimodal IONM, including peripheral nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (pnSSEPs) and dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials (dSSEPs), spontaneous electromyography (EMG), transcranial motor evoked potentials (MEPs), and electroencephalogram (EEG) for some trials and all permanent DRG-S lead placement per surgeon preference. Alert criteria for each IONM modality were established before data acquisition and collection. An IONM alert was used to implement an immediate repositioning of the lead to reduce any possible postoperative neurologic deficits. We reviewed the literature and summarized the current IONM modalities commonly applied during DRG-S, including somatosensory evoked potentials and EMG. Because DRG-S targets the dorsal roots, we hypothesized that including dSSEP would allow more sensitivity as a proxy for potential sensory changes under generalized anesthesia than would including standard pnSSEPs.
From our case series of 22 consecutive procedures with 45 lead placements, one case had an alert immediately after DRG-S lead positioning. In this case, dSSEP attenuation was seen, indicating changes in the S1 dermatome, which occurred despite ipsilateral pnSSEP from the posterior tibial nerve remaining at baselines. The dSSEP alert prompted the surgeon to reposition the S1 lead, resulting in immediate recovery of the dSSEP to baseline status. The rate of IONM alerts reported intraoperatively was 4.55% per procedure and 2.22% per lead (n = 1). No neurologic deficits were reported after the procedure, resulting in no postoperative neurologic complications or deficits. No other IONM changes or alerts were observed from pnSSEP, spontaneous EMG, MEPs, or EEG modalities. Reviewing the literature, we noted challenges and potential deficiencies when using current IONM modalities for DRG-S procedures.
Our case series suggests dSSEPs offer greater reliability than do pnSSEPs in quickly detecting neurologic changes, and subsequent neural injury, during DRG-S cases. We encourage future studies to focus on adding dSSEP to standard pnSSEP to provide a comprehensive, real-time neurophysiological assessment during lead placement for DRG-S. More investigation, collaboration, and evidence are required to evaluate, compare, and standardize comprehensive IONM protocols for DRG-S.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37245141/

This study explored the association between NSE and EEG, considering the role of EEG timing, its background continuity, reactivity, occurrence of epileptiform discharges, and pre-defined malignancy degree.
Retrospective analysis including 445 consecutive adults from a prospective registry, surviving the first 24 hours after CA and undergoing multimodal evaluation. EEG were interpreted blinded to NSE results.
Higher NSE was associated with poor EEG prognosticators, such as increasing malignancy, repetitive epileptiform discharges and lack of background reactivity, independently of EEG timing (including sedation and temperature). When stratified for background continuity, NSE was higher with repetitive epileptiform discharges, except in the case of suppressed EEGs. This relationship showed some variation according to the recording time.
Neuronal injury after CA, reflected by NSE, correlates with several EEG features: increasing EEG malignancy, lack of background reactivity, and presence of repetitive epileptiform discharges. The correlation between epileptiform discharges and NSE is influenced by underlying EEG background and timing.
This study, describing the complex interplay between serum NSE and epileptiform features, suggests that epileptiform discharges reflect neuronal injury particularly in non-suppressed EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37236128/

This retrospective study included 140 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy who received total intravenous anesthesia using a combination of propofol and dexmedetomidine infusions. Patients were equally matched to the spectrogram group (maintaining the robust EEG alpha power during surgery) or the index group (maintaining the BIS score between 40 and 60 during surgery) based on the propensity score of age and surgical type. The primary outcome was the propofol dose. Secondary outcome was the postoperative neurological profile.
Patients in the spectrogram group received significantly less propofol (1585 ± 581 vs. 2314 ± 810 mg, P < 0.001). Fewer patients in the spectrogram group exhibited delayed emergence (1.4% vs. 11.4%, P = 0.033). The postoperative delirium profile was similar between the groups (profile P = 0.227).

Although EEG analysis has traditionally focused exclusively on oscillatory power, recent investigations have shown that the aperiodic EEG component can distinguish conscious wakefulness from sleep and anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. This study investigates the aperiodic EEG component of individuals in a disorder of consciousness (DOC); how it changes in response to exposure to anesthesia; and how it relates to the brain's information richness and criticality. High-density EEG was recorded from 43 individuals in a DOC, with 16 of these individuals undergoing a protocol of propofol anesthesia. The aperiodic component was defined by the spectral slope of the power spectral density. Our results demonstrate that the EEG aperiodic component is more informative about the participants' level of consciousness than the oscillatory component, especially for patients that suffered from a stroke. Importantly, the pharmacologically induced change in the spectral slope from 30 to 45 Hz positively correlated with individual's pre-anesthetic level of consciousness. The pharmacologically induced loss of information-richness and criticality was associated with individual's pre-anesthetic aperiodic component. During exposure to anesthesia, the aperiodic component distinguished individuals with DOC, according to their 3-month recovery status. The aperiodic EEG component has been historically neglected; this research highlights the necessity of considering this measure for the assessment of individuals in DOC and future research that seeks to understand the neurophysiological underpinnings of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37209758/

Patients with focal DRE who had undergone epilepsy surgery were included in the present study. All patients underwent a comprehensive presurgical evaluation. Postoperative seizure outcomes were classified using the Engel Epilepsy Surgery Outcome Scale.
After surgery, 33 patients (62.2%) were Class I according to the Engel classification of surgical outcomes; eight patients (15.0%) were Class II, 11 (20.7%) were Class III, and one (1.8%) was Class IV. The relationships of presurgical, surgical, and postsurgical clinical variables to seizure outcomes were compared. Older age at seizure onset, older age at the time of surgery, the presence of focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, seizure duration over 2 minutes, unsuccessful treatment with three or fewer antiseizure medications, lesions confined to one lobe (as demonstrated via magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), surgical site in the temporal lobe, and histopathology including developmental tumors were significantly linked to an Engel Class I outcome. A univariate analysis of excellent surgical outcomes showed that lateralized semiology, localized interictal and ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) discharges, lateralized single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography findings, and temporal lobe resections were significantly related to excellent seizure outcomes.
The results of our study are encouraging and similar to those found in other centers around the world. Epilepsy surgery remains an underutilized treatment for children with DRE and should be offered early.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37162422/

App-based mindfulness meditation combined with an electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) shows promise as effective and accessible adjuncts in medical practice.
This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a BCI-based mindfulness meditation app in improving the experience of patients with AF during RFCA.
This single-center pilot randomized controlled trial involved 84 eligible patients with AF scheduled for RFCA, who were randomized 1:1 to the intervention and control groups. Both groups received a standardized RFCA procedure and a conscious sedative regimen. Patients in the control group were administered conventional care, while those in the intervention group received BCI-based app-delivered mindfulness meditation from a research nurse. The primary outcomes were the changes in the numeric rating scale, State Anxiety Inventory, and Brief Fatigue Inventory scores. Secondary outcomes were the differences in hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, and peripheral oxygen saturation), adverse events, patient-reported pain, and the doses of sedative drugs used in ablation.
BCI-based app-delivered mindfulness meditation, compared to conventional care, resulted in a significantly lower mean numeric rating scale (mean 4.6, SD 1.7 [app-based mindfulness meditation] vs mean 5.7, SD 2.1 [conventional care]; P=.008), State Anxiety Inventory (mean 36.7, SD 5.5 vs mean 42.3, SD 7.2; P<.001), and Brief Fatigue Inventory (mean 3.4, SD 2.3 vs mean 4.7, SD 2.2; P=.01) scores. No significant differences were observed in hemodynamic parameters or the amounts of parecoxib and dexmedetomidine used in RFCA between the 2 groups. The intervention group exhibited a significant decrease in fentanyl use compared to the control group, with a mean dose of 3.96 (SD 1.37) mcg/kg versus 4.85 (SD 1.25) mcg/kg in the control group (P=.003).The incidence of adverse events was lower in the intervention group (5/40) than in the control group (10/40), though this difference was not significant (P=.15).
BCI-based app-delivered mindfulness meditation effectively relieved physical and psychological discomfort and may reduce the doses of sedative medication used in RFCA for patients with AF.

It is therefore important to avoid any factors causing delirium as far as possible. Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring can be used during anesthesia to individually adjust dosages of hypnotically acting drugs. It is necessary to gain knowledge about the relationship between intraoperative EEG and postoperative delirium in children.
In a dataset comprising 89 children (53 male, 36 female; median age: 0.99 (interquartile range: 0.51, 4.89) years) undergoing cardiac surgery involving use of a heart-lung machine, relationships between depth of anesthesia as measured by EEG (EEG index: Narcotrend Index (NI)), sevoflurane dosage, and body temperature were analyzed. A Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAP-D) score ≥ 9 indicated delirium.
The EEG could be used in patients of all age groups for patient monitoring during anesthesia. In the context of induced hypothermia, EEG monitoring supported individually adjusted sevoflurane dosing. The NI was significantly correlated with the body temperature; decreasing temperature was accompanied by a decreasing NI. A CAP-D score ≥ 9 was documented in 61 patients (68.5%); 28 patients (31.5%) had a CAP-D < 9.

A case report.,Psychiatria polska,2024,"Chrobak J, Rodek P, Kucia K","Electroconvulsive therapy has been a method used in psychiatry since 1938 and despite its rather turbulent history, it is still the most effective method of treating severe mental disorders. Despite its high efficiency and good safety profile, patients with catatonia usually require a large number of treatments. It entails a long hospitalization time and the necessity to repeatedly induce general anesthesia. In 1966, Blachly proposed to induce more than one seizure during a single anesthesia. According to this method, the patient was to be constantly monitored (ECG, EEG) during a series of electroconvulsions, which consisted of two to even eight treatments. For simplicity, the method is called multiple-monitored ECT (MMECT). The work is based on the medical history of a patient diagnosed with catatonic schizophrenia. Due to the insufficient effect of single treatments, we decided to use the MMECT method, which was performed in series of three treatments, twice a week. Thanks to the therapy, catatonic symptoms remitted. Studies in various patient populations have shown that MMECT reduces hospitalization time, the duration of acute symptoms, and the patient's total exposure to anesthetics and muscle relaxants. As the above case shows, MMECT can potentially be considered as a safe treatment alternative in patients that require a large number of treatments, resistant to standard forms of therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37125506/

So far, no studies have compared the influence of methohexital vs. a combination of propofol/esketamine on established SQ parameters.
This retrospective longitudinal study compared eight established SQ parameters (PSI, ASEI, MSC, midictal amplitude, motor and electroencephalography (EEG) seizure duration, concordance, PHR) before and after the change from propofol/esketamine to methohexital in 34 patients under maintenance ECT. Each patient contributed four measurements, two before and two after the anesthesia change. Anesthesia dose, stimulus dose, electrode placement, and concomitant medication remained unchanged throughout the analyzed treatments.

Recently, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) was introduced to analyze nonlinear and nonstationary data. In this study, we assessed whether the changes in EEG characteristics during general anesthesia that are analyzed by the HHT are useful for monitoring the depth of anesthesia.
This retrospective observational study enrolled patients who underwent propofol anesthesia. Raw EEG signals were obtained from a monitor through a previously developed software application. We developed an HHT analyzer to decompose the EEG signal into six intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and estimated the instantaneous frequencies (HHT_IF) for each IMF. Changes over time in the raw EEG waves and parameters such as HHT_IF, BIS, spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), and electromyogram parameter (EMGlow) were assessed, and a Gaussian process regression model was created to assess the association between BIS and HHT_IF.
We analyzed EEG signals from 30 patients. The beta oscillation frequency range (13-25 Hz) was detected in IMF1 and IMF2 during the awake state, then after loss of consciousness, the frequency decreased and alpha oscillation (8-12 Hz) was detected in IMF2. At the emergence phase, the frequency increased and beta oscillations were detected in IMF1, IMF2, and IMF3. BIS and EMGlow changed significantly during the induction and emergence phases, whereas SEF95 showed a wide variability and no significant changes during the induction phase. The root mean square error between the observed BIS values and the values predicted by a Gaussian process regression model ranged from 4.69 to 9.68.
We applied the HHT to EEG analyses during propofol anesthesia. The instantaneous frequency in IMF1 and IMF2 identified changes in EEG characteristics during induction and emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, the HHT_IF in IMF2 showed strong associations with BIS and was suitable for depicting the alpha oscillation. Our study suggests that the HHT is useful for monitoring the depth of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37059989/

Patients with anesthesia for SE from 2015 to 2021 at two Swiss academic medical centers were categorized as anesthetized as recommended third-line treatment, earlier (as first- or second-line treatment), and delayed (later as third-line treatment). Associations between timing of anesthesia and in-hospital outcomes were estimated by logistic regression.
Of 762 patients, 246 received anesthesia; 21% were anesthetized as recommended, 55% earlier, and 24% delayed. Propofol was preferably used for earlier (86% vs. 55.5% for recommended/delayed anesthesia) and midazolam for later anesthesia (17.2% vs. 15.9% for earlier anesthesia). Earlier anesthesia was statistically significantly associated with fewer infections (17% vs. 32.7%), shorter median SE duration (.5 vs. 1.5 days), and more returns to premorbid neurologic function (52.9% vs. 35.5%).

During propofol general anesthesia, intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) variables, such as alpha band power (α-BP), correlate with cognitive status. This relationship under sevoflurane is unclear. We investigated whether EEG biomarkers of poor cognitive status found under propofol could be extended to sevoflurane.
In this monocentric prospective observational study, 106 patients with intraoperative EEG monitoring were included (propofol/sevoflurane = 55/51). We administered the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale to identify abnormal cognition (low MoCA) 1 day before intervention. EEG variables included delta to beta frequency band powers. Results were adjusted to age and drug dosage. We assessed depth of anesthesia (DoA) using the spectral edge frequency (SEF 95 ) and maintained it within (8-13) Hz.
The difference in α-BP between low and normal MoCA patients was significantly larger among propofol patients (propofol: 4.3 ± 4.8 dB versus sevoflurane: 1.5 ± 3.4 dB, P = .022). SEF 95 and age were not statistically different between sevoflurane and propofol groups. After adjusting to age and dose, low α-BP was significantly associated with low MoCA under propofol (odds ratio [OR] [confidence interval {CI}] = 0.39 [0.16-0.94], P = .034), but not under sevoflurane, where theta-band power was significantly associated with low MoCA (OR [CI] = 0.31 [0.13-0.73], P = .007).

Interestingly, the sympathetic control of pupil size is thought to be lost in states of unconsciousness. We therefore hypothesized that administration of brimonidine (an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist) eye drops into one eye should produce a pharmacologic Horner's syndrome if the clinically unresponsive patient is conscious, but not if the patient is unconscious. Here, in a first step to explore this hypothesis, we investigated the potential of brimonidine eye drops to distinguish preserved sympathetic pupillary function in awake volunteers from impairment of sympathetic tone in patients in a coma.
We enrolled comatose patients admitted for acute brain injury to one of the intensive care units (ICU) of a tertiary referral center, in whom EEG and/or neuroimaging for all practical purposes had ruled out residual consciousness. Exclusion criteria were deep sedation, medications with known drug interactions with brimonidine, and a history of eye disease. Age- and sex-matched healthy and awake volunteers served as controls. We measured pupils of both eyes, under scotopic conditions, at baseline and five times 5-120 min after administering brimonidine into the right eye, using automated pupillometry. Primary outcomes were miosis and anisocoria at the individual and group levels.
We included 15 comatose ICU patients (seven women, mean age 59 ± 13.8 years) and 15 controls (seven women, mean age 55 ± 16.3 years). At 30 min, miosis and anisocoria were seen in all 15 controls (mean difference between the brimonidine-treated pupil and the control pupil: - 1.31 mm, 95% CI [- 1.51; - 1.11], p < 0.001), but in none (p < 0.001) of the 15 ICU patients (mean difference: 0.09 mm, 95% CI [- 0.12;0.30], p > 0.99). This effect was unchanged after 120 min and remained robust in sensitivity analyses correcting for baseline pupil size, age, and room illuminance.
In this proof-of-principle study, brimonidine eye drops produced anisocoria in awake volunteers but not in comatose patients with brain injury. This suggests that automated pupillometry after administration of brimonidine can distinguish between the extremes of the spectrum of consciousness (i.e., fully conscious vs. deeply comatose).

We visualized spatial distributions of the electrocorticography biomarkers at an oxygen baseline, three time-points while sevoflurane was increasing, and at a plateau of 2 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) sevoflurane. HFO EC was combined with diffusion-weighted imaging, in dynamic tractography.
Intraoperative HFO EC diffusely increased as a function of sevoflurane concentration, although most in epileptogenic sites (defined as those included in the resection); their ability to classify epileptogenicity was optimized at sevoflurane 2 MAC. HFO EC could be visualized on major white matter tracts, as a function of sevoflurane level.
The results strengthened the hypothesis that sevoflurane-activated HFO biomarkers may help intraoperatively localize the epileptogenic zone.

EEG alpha power emerged as a promising marker for DoC, although long-standing literature reported alpha power being sustained during anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, and reduced during dreaming and hallucinations. We hypothesized that EEG power suppression caused by severe anoxia could explain this conflict. Accordingly, we split DoC patients (n = 87) in postanoxic and non-postanoxic cohorts. Alpha power was suppressed only in severe postanoxia but failed to discriminate un/consciousness in other aetiologies. Furthermore, it did not generalize to an independent reference dataset (n = 65) of neurotypical, neurological, and anesthesia conditions. We then investigated EEG spatio-spectral gradients, reflecting anteriorization and slowing, as alternative markers. In non-postanoxic DoC, these features, combined in a bivariate model, reliably stratified patients and indexed consciousness, even in unresponsive patients identified as conscious by an independent neural marker (the Perturbational Complexity Index). Crucially, this model optimally generalized to the reference dataset. Overall, alpha power does not index consciousness; rather, its suppression entails diffuse cortical damage, in postanoxic patients. As an alternative, EEG spatio-spectral gradients, reflecting distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, jointly provide a robust, parsimonious, and generalizable marker of consciousness, whose clinical application may guide rehabilitation efforts.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36977648/

LOR was defined as five inspirations without accompanied squeezes; ROR was defined as the return of five inspirations accompanied by squeezes. Brain states were monitored using 64-channel EEG. Dexmedetomidine was administered as a target-controlled infusion, with Ce estimated from a pharmacokinetic model.
Counter to our hypothesis, mean estimated dexmedetomidine Ce was lower at LOR (0.92 ng ml
The breathe-squeeze task can effectively track changes in responsiveness during sedation without external stimuli and might be more sensitive to state changes than stimulus-based tasks. It should be considered when perturbation of brain states is undesirable.

36963911,Leveraging electronic medical record-embedded standardised electroencephalogram reporting to develop neonatal seizure prediction models: a retrospective cohort study.,The Lancet. Digital health,2023,"McKee JL, Kaufman MC, Gonzalez AK, Fitzgerald MP, Massey SL, Fung F, Kessler SK, Witzman S, Abend NS, Helbig I","Accurate prediction of seizures can help to direct resource-intense continuous electroencephalogram (CEEG) monitoring to neonates at high risk of seizures. We aimed to use data from standardised EEG reports to generate seizure prediction models for vulnerable neonates.
In this retrospective cohort study, we included neonates who underwent CEEG during the first 30 days of life at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA, USA). The hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy subgroup included only patients with CEEG data during the first 5 days of life, International Classification of Diseases, revision 10, codes for hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, and documented therapeutic hypothermia. In January, 2018, we implemented a novel CEEG reporting system within the electronic medical record (EMR) using common data elements that incorporated standardised terminology. All neonatal CEEG data from Jan 10, 2018, to Feb 15, 2022, were extracted from the EMR using age at the time of CEEG. We developed logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models of neonatal seizure prediction using EEG features on day 1 to predict seizures on future days.
We evaluated 1117 neonates, including 150 neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, with CEEG data reported using standardised templates between Jan 10, 2018, and Feb 15, 2022. Implementation of a consistent EEG reporting system that documents discrete and standardised EEG variables resulted in more than 95% reporting of key EEG features. Several EEG features were highly correlated, and patients could be clustered on the basis of specific features. However, no simple combination of features adequately predicted seizure risk. We therefore applied computational models to complement clinical identification of neonates at high risk of seizures. Random forest models incorporating background features performed with classification accuracies of up to 90% (95% CI 83-94) for all neonates and 97% (88-99) for neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy; recall (sensitivity) of up to 97% (91-100) for all neonates and 100% (100-100) for neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy; and precision (positive predictive value) of up to 92% (84-96) in the overall cohort and 97% (80-99) in neonates with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy.
Using data extracted from the standardised EEG report on the first day of CEEG, we predict the presence or absence of neonatal seizures on subsequent days with classification performances of more than 90%. This information, incorporated into routine care, could guide decisions about the necessity of continuing EEG monitoring beyond the first day, thereby improving the allocation of limited CEEG resources. Additionally, this analysis shows the benefits of standardised clinical data collection, which can drive learning health system approaches to personalised CEEG use.

36961823,A Pilot Investigation Evaluating Relative Changes in Fronto-Occipital Alpha and Beta Spectral Power as Measurement of Anesthesia Hypnotic Depth.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2023,"Fehrlin ES, Hight D, Kaiser HA, Luedi MM, Huber M, Zubler F, Lersch F","Other than clinical observation of a patient's vegetative response to nociception, monitoring the hypnotic component of general anesthesia (GA) and unconsciousness relies on electroencephalography (EEG)-based indices. These indices exclusively based on frontal EEG activity neglect an important observation. One of the main hallmarks of transitions from wakefulness to GA is a shift in alpha oscillations (7.5-12.5 Hz activity) from occipital brain regions toward anterior brain regions (""alpha anteriorization""). Monitoring the degree of this alpha anteriorization may help to guide induction and maintenance of hypnotic depth and prevent intraoperative awareness. However, the occipital region of the brain is completely disregarded and occipital alpha as characteristic of wakefulness and its posterior-to-anterior shift during induction are missed. Here, we propose an application of Narcotrend's reduced power alpha beta (RPAB) index, originally developed to monitor differences in hemispheric perfusion, for determining the ratio of alpha and beta activity in the anterior-posterior axis.
Perioperative EEG data of 32 patients undergoing GA in the ophthalmic surgery department of Bern University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. EEG was recorded with the Narcotrend® monitor using a frontal (Fp1-Fp2) and a posterior (T9-Oz) bipolar derivation with reference electrode over A2. The RPAB index was computed between both bipolar signals, defining the fronto-occipital RPAB (FO-RPAB). FO-RPAB was analyzed during wakefulness, GA maintenance, and emergence, as well as before and after the intraoperative administration of a ketamine bolus. FO-RPAB was compared with a classical quantitative EEG measure-the spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF-95).
A significant shift of the FO-RPAB was observed during both induction of and emergence from GA ( P < .001). Interestingly, the additional administration of ketamine during GA did not lead to a significant change in FO-RPAB ( P = 0.81). In contrast, a significant increase in the SEF-95 in the frontal channel was observed during the 10-minute period after ketamine administration ( P < .001).
FO-RPAB appears to qualify as a marker of unconsciousness, reflecting physiological fronto-occipital activity differences during GA. In contrast to frontal SEF-95, it is not disturbed by additional administration of ketamine for analgesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36961823/
36934515,The use of processed electroencephalography (pEEG) in obstetric anaesthesia: a narrative review.,International journal of obstetric anesthesia,2023,"Corner H, Barley M, Metodiev Y","Accidental awareness under general anaesthesia (AAGA) remains a major complication of anaesthesia. The incidence of AAGA during obstetric anaesthesia is high relative to other specialities. The use of processed electroencephalography (pEEG) in the form of ""depth of anaesthesia"" monitoring has been shown to reduce the incidence of AAGA in the non-obstetric population. The evidence for using pEEG to prevent AAGA in the obstetric population is poor and requires further exploration. Furthermore, pregnancy and disease states affecting the central nervous system, such as pre-eclampsia, may alter the interpretation of pEEG waveforms although this has not been fully characterised. National guidelines exist for pEEG monitoring with total intravenous anaesthesia and for ""high-risk"" cases regardless of technique, including the obstetric population. However, none of the currently available guidelines relates specifically to obstetric anaesthesia. Using pEEG monitoring for obstetric anaesthesia may also provide additional benefits beyond a reduction in risk of AAGA. These potential benefits include reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting, reduced anaesthetic agent use, and a shorter post-anaesthetic recovery stay. In addition, pEEG acts as a surrogate marker of cerebral perfusion, and thus as an additional monitor for impending cardiovascular collapse, as seen in amniotic fluid embolism. The subtle physiological and pathological changes in EEG activity that may occur during pregnancy are an unexplored research area in the context of anaesthetic pEEG monitors. We believe that the direction of clinical practice is moving towards greater use of pEEG monitoring and individualisation of anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36934515/
36922266,Electroencephalographic delta and alpha oscillations reveal phase-amplitude coupling in paediatric patients undergoing sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia.,British journal of anaesthesia,2023,"Zakaria L, Desowska A, Berde CB, Cornelissen L","Sevoflurane-induced anaesthesia generates frontal alpha oscillations as early as 6 months of age, whereas strong delta oscillations are present at birth. In adults, delta oscillations and alpha oscillations are coupled: the phase of delta waves modulates the amplitude of alpha oscillations in a phenomenon known as phase-amplitude coupling. We hypothesise that delta-alpha phase-amplitude coupling exists in young children and is a feature of sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia distinct from emergence after anaesthesia.
Electroencephalographic data from 31 paediatric patients aged 10 months to 3 yr undergoing elective surgery with sevoflurane-based anaesthesia were analysed retrospectively. Delta-alpha phase-amplitude coupling was evaluated during maintenance of anaesthesia and during emergence.
Delta-alpha phase-amplitude coupling was observed in the study population. Strength of phase-amplitude coupling, represented by the delta-alpha mean amplitude vector, was greater during general anaesthesia than during emergence (Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test, Z=3.107, P=0.002). Frontal alpha amplitude during anaesthesia was not uniformly distributed across all delta phases. During general anaesthesia, alpha power was restricted to the positive phase of the delta wave (omnibus circular uniformity, general anaesthesia: P<0.001, mean phase: 114º; 99% confidence interval: 90º-139º; emergence: P=0.35, mean phase 181º, 99% confidence interval: 110º-253º).
Sevoflurane-based anaesthesia is associated with delta-alpha phase-amplitude coupling in paediatric patients. These findings improve our understanding of cortical dynamics in children undergoing general anaesthesia, which might improve paediatric intraoperative depth of anaesthesia monitoring techniques.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36922266/

We enrolled 84 patients who underwent radical cancer surgeries with reconstruction for esophageal cancer, oral floor cancer, or pharyngeal cancer under total intravenous anesthesia. We collected the perioperative EEG data and the perioperative data of the inflammatory markers, including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, presepsin, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The existence of POD was evaluated based on the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. We compared the time-dependent changes in the relative ratio of the EEG α-power and inflammatory markers between the patients with and without POD.
Four of the 84 patients were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 80 patients, 25 developed POD and the other 55 did not. The relative ratio of the α-power at baseline was significantly lower in the POD group than the non-POD group (0.18 ± 0.08 vs 0.28 ± 0.11, P < .001). A time-dependent decline in the relative ratio of α-power in the EEG during surgery was observed in both groups. There were significant differences between the POD and non-POD groups in the baseline, 3-h, 6-h, and 9-h values of the relative ratio of α-power. The preoperative NLR of the POD group was significantly higher than that of the non-POD group (2.88 ± 1.04 vs 2.22 ± 1.00, P < .001), but other intraoperative inflammatory markers were comparable between the groups. Two multivariable logistic regression models demonstrated that the relative ratio of the α-power at baseline was significantly associated with POD.
Intraoperative frontal relative ratios of the α-power of EEG were associated with POD in patients who underwent radical cancer surgery. Intraoperative EEG monitoring could be a simple and more useful tool for predicting the development of postoperative delirium than measuring perioperative acute inflammatory markers. A lower relative ratio of α-power might be an effective marker for vulnerability of brain and ultimately for the development of POD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36917508/

The functional significance of alpha anteriorization and the precise brain regions contributing to the phenomenon are a mystery. While posterior alpha is thought to be generated by thalamocortical circuits connecting nuclei of the sensory thalamus with their cortical partners, the thalamic origins of the propofol-induced alpha remain poorly understood. Here, we used human intracranial recordings to identify regions in sensory cortices where propofol attenuates a coherent alpha network, distinct from those in the frontal cortex where it amplifies coherent alpha and beta activities. We then performed diffusion tractography between these identified regions and individual thalamic nuclei to show that the opposing dynamics of anteriorization occur within two distinct thalamocortical networks. We found that propofol disrupted a posterior alpha network structurally connected with nuclei in the sensory and sensory associational regions of the thalamus. At the same time, propofol induced a coherent alpha oscillation within prefrontal cortical areas that were connected with thalamic nuclei involved in cognition, such as the mediodorsal nucleus. The cortical and thalamic anatomy involved, as well as their known functional roles, suggests multiple means by which propofol dismantles sensory and cognitive processes to achieve loss of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36897972/

We took 52 EEG signals showing intraoperative patterns of diminished anaesthesia, similar to those that occur during emergence (after surgery) and subjected them to analysis by five commercially available monitors.
We compared five monitors (BIS, Entropy-SE, Narcotrend, qCON, and Sedline) to see if index values remained within, or moved out of, each monitors' recommended index range for general anaesthesia for at least 2 min during a period of supposed lighter anaesthesia, as observed by changes in the EEG spectrogram obtained in a previous study.
Of the 52 cases, 27 (52%) had at least one monitor warning of potentially inadequate hypnosis (index above range) and 16 of the 52 cases (31%) had at least one monitor signifying excessive hypnotic depth (index below clinical range). Of the 52 cases, only 16 (31%) showed concordance between all five monitors. Nineteen cases (36%) had one monitor discordant compared with the remaining four, and 17 cases (33%) had two monitors in disagreement with the remaining three.
Many clinical providers still rely on index values and manufacturer's recommended ranges for titration decision making. That two-thirds of cases showed discordant recommendations given identical EEG data, and that one-third signified excessive hypnotic depth where the EEG would suggest a lighter hypnotic state, emphasizes the importance of personalised EEG interpretation as an essential clinical skill.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36894408/

We aimed to assess how patient stratification by known ES risk factors would impact CEEG utilization.
This was a prospective observational study of critically ill children with encephalopathy who underwent CEEG. We calculated the average CEEG duration required to identify a patient with ES for the full cohort and subgroups stratified by known ES risk factors.
ES occurred in 345 of 1,399 patients (25%). For the full cohort, an average of 90 hours of CEEG would be required to identify 90% of patients with ES. If subgroups of patients were stratified by age, clinically evident seizures before CEEG initiation, and early EEG risk factors, then 20 to 1,046 hours of CEEG would be required to identify a patient with ES. Patients with clinically evident seizures before CEEG initiation and EEG risk factors present in the initial hour of CEEG required only 20 (<1 year) or 22 (≥1 year) hours of CEEG to identify a patient with ES. Conversely, patients with no clinically evident seizures before CEEG initiation and no EEG risk factors in the initial hour of CEEG required 405 (<1 year) or 1,046 (≥1 year) hours of CEEG to identify a patient with ES. Patients with clinically evident seizures before CEEG initiation or EEG risk factors in the initial hour of CEEG required 29 to 120 hours of CEEG to identify a patient with ES.
Stratifying patients by clinical and EEG risk factors could identify high- and low-yield subgroups for CEEG by considering ES incidence, the duration of CEEG required to identify ES, and subgroup size.

Patients with RSE treated with anesthetics at a Swiss academic care center from 2011 to 2019 were included. Clinical data and semiquantitative EEG analyses were assessed. Burst suppression was categorized as incomplete burst suppression (with ≥20% and <50% suppression proportion) or complete burst suppression (with ≥50% suppression proportion). The frequency of induced burst suppression and association of burst suppression with outcomes (persistent seizure termination, in-hospital survival, and return to premorbid neurologic function) were the endpoints.

In this prospective observational study, we investigated the electroencephalogram (EEG) of infants under spinal anesthesia and hypothesized that we would observe EEG features similar to those seen during sleep.
We computed the EEG power spectra and spectrograms of 34 infants undergoing infraumbilical surgeries under spinal anesthesia (median age 11.5 weeks postmenstrual age, range 38-65 weeks postmenstrual age). Spectrograms were visually scored for episodes of EEG discontinuity or spindle activity. We characterized the relationship between EEG discontinuity or spindles and gestational age, postmenstrual age, or chronological age using logistic regression analyses.
The predominant EEG patterns observed in infants under spinal anesthesia were slow oscillations, spindles, and EEG discontinuities. The presence of spindles, observed starting at about 49 weeks postmenstrual age, was best described by postmenstrual age ( P =.002) and was more likely with increasing postmenstrual age. The presence of EEG discontinuities, best described by gestational age ( P = .015), was more likely with decreasing gestational age. These age-related changes in the presence of spindles and EEG discontinuities in infants under spinal anesthesia generally corresponded to developmental changes in the sleep EEG.
This work illustrates 2 separate key age-dependent transitions in EEG dynamics during infant spinal anesthesia that may reflect the maturation of underlying brain circuits: (1) diminishing discontinuities with increasing gestational age and (2) the appearance of spindles with increasing postmenstrual age. The similarity of these age-dependent transitions under spinal anesthesia with transitions in the developing brain during physiological sleep supports a sleep-related mechanism for the apparent sedation observed during infant spinal anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36881544/

We investigated a novel 2-channel electroencephalogram (EEG)-based marker for stroke detection-the lateral interconnection ratio (LIR)-in AS patients having endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) with general anesthesia (GA) or sedation. The LIR in 2 reference groups of patients without postoperative neurological complications was used for comparison.
The National Institutes of Health stroke scale score was assessed before and after thrombectomy in 100 patients having EVT with GA or sedation. The EEG was monitored during and for 4 hours following EVT in the AS group and during surgery in the 2 reference groups. We compared: (1) LIR between AS and reference groups; (2) LIR and stroke dynamics (clinical improvement or deterioration after EVT assessed by the National Institutes of Health stroke scale score); (3) the impact of stroke site (anterior vs. posterior circulation) and anesthesia type (GA vs. sedation) on the LIR.
Median (interquartile range) LIR was lower in patients with AS compared with reference patients (0.09, 0.05 to 0.16 vs. 0.39, 0.24 to 0.52, respectively; P <0.000002), and LIR increased in AS patients whose clinical status recovered after EVT compared with nonrecovered patients (0.20, 0.12 to 0.29 vs. 0.09, 0.05 to 0.11, respectively; P <0.007). The LIR might be more sensitive to anterior circulation stroke but is not impacted by anesthesia type.

36729437,A Narrative Review Illustrating the Clinical Utility of Electroencephalogram-Guided Anesthesia Care in Children.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2023,"Bong CL, Balanza GA, Khoo CE, Tan JS, Desel T, Purdon PL","The major therapeutic end points of general anesthesia include hypnosis, amnesia, and immobility. There is a complex relationship between general anesthesia, responsiveness, hemodynamic stability, and reaction to noxious stimuli. This complexity is compounded in pediatric anesthesia, where clinicians manage children from a wide range of ages, developmental stages, and body sizes, with their concomitant differences in physiology and pharmacology. This renders anesthetic requirements difficult to predict based solely on a child's age, body weight, and vital signs. Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring provides a window into children's brain states and may be useful in guiding clinical anesthesia management. However, many clinicians are unfamiliar with EEG monitoring in children. Young children's EEGs differ substantially from those of older children and adults, and there is a lack of evidence-based guidance on how and when to use the EEG for anesthesia care in children. This narrative review begins by summarizing what is known about EEG monitoring in pediatric anesthesia care. A key knowledge gap in the literature relates to a lack of practical information illustrating the utility of the EEG in clinical management. To address this gap, this narrative review illustrates how the EEG spectrogram can be used to visualize, in real time, brain responses to anesthetic drugs in relation to hemodynamic stability, surgical stimulation, and other interventions such as cardiopulmonary bypass. This review discusses anesthetic management principles in a variety of clinical scenarios, including infants, children with altered conscious levels, children with atypical neurodevelopment, children with hemodynamic instability, children undergoing total intravenous anesthesia, and those undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Each scenario is accompanied by practical illustrations of how the EEG can be visualized to help titrate anesthetic dosage to avoid undersedation or oversedation when patients experience hypotension or other physiological challenges, when surgical stimulation increases, and when a child's anesthetic requirements are otherwise less predictable. Overall, this review illustrates how well-established clinical management principles in children can be significantly complemented by the addition of EEG monitoring, thus enabling personalized anesthesia care to enhance patient safety and experience.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36729437/
36727845,Performance of the SEDLine Monitor: Age Dependency and Time Delay.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2023,"Obert DP, Schneider F, Schneider G, von Dincklage F, Sepulveda P, García PS, Kratzer S, Kreuzer M","Devices monitoring the hypnotic component of general anesthesia can help to guide anesthetic management. The main purposes of these devices are the titration of anesthesia dose. While anesthesia at low doses can result in awareness with intraoperative memory formation, excessive administration of anesthetics may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative neurocognitive disorder. We have previously shown for various indices that they are significantly influenced by the patient's age and that the monitors have a significant time delay. Here, we evaluated the influence of patient's age and time delay on the patient state index (PSI) of the SEDLine monitor.
To analyze the influence of the patient's age, we replayed 2 minutes of electroencephalography (EEG) of 141 patients (19-88 years, ASA I-IV) undergoing general anesthesia maintained with desflurane, sevoflurane, or propofol to the SEDLine monitor. We extracted the PSI as well as the spectral edge frequency (SEF) and performed a linear regression analysis. For evaluation of the time delay, we replayed 5 minutes of EEG of stable episodes of adequate anesthesia (PSI between 25 and 50) or light sedation/wake (PSI >70) in different orders to the SEDLine to simulate sudden changes between the states. Time delays were defined as the required time span of the monitor to reach the stable target index.
PSI and SEF increased significantly with the patient's age. These findings did not depend on the administered anesthetic. The evaluation of the correlation between SEF and PSI showed a strong correlation with Spearman's correlation coefficient of ρ = 0.86 (0.82; 0.89). The time delays depended on the type of transition. We found a median time delay of 54 (Min: 46; Max: 61) seconds for the important transition between adequate anesthesia and awake and 55 (Min: 50; Max: 67) seconds in the other direction.
With our analyses, we show that the indices presented on the SEDLine display, the PSI and the SEF, increase with age for patients under general anesthesia. Additionally, a delay of the PSI to react to sudden neurophysiologic changes due to dose of the maintenance anesthetic is of a time course that is clinically significant. These factors should be considered when navigating anesthesia relying on only the proprietary index for the SEDLine monitor.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36727845/

In particular, PACU-D is among common postoperative complications of elderly patients. As PACU-D may be associated with postoperative delirium, early detection of at-risk patients and strategies to prevent PACU-D are important. We characterized EEG baseline signatures of patients who developed PACU-D following surgery and general anesthesia and patients who did not.
We conducted a post-hoc analysis of preoperative EEG recordings between patients with and without PACU-D, as indicated by positive bCAM scores post general anesthesia and surgery.
Preoperative baseline EEG recordings from 89 patients were recorded at controlled eyes-open (focused wakefulness) and eyes-closed (relaxed wakefulness) conditions. We computed power spectral densities, permutation entropy, spectral entropy and spectral edge frequency to see if these parameters can reflect potential baseline EEG differences between PACU-D (31.5%) and noPACU-D (68.5%) patients. Wilcoxon's Rank Sum Test as well as AUC values were used to determine statistical significance.
Baseline EEG recordings showed significant differences between PACU-D and noPACU-D patients preoperatively. Compared to the noPACU-D group, PACU-D patients presented with lower power in higher frequencies during relaxed and focused wakefulness alike. These differences in power led to AUC values of 0.73 [0.59;0.85] (permutation entropy) and 0.72 [0.61;0.83] (spectral edge frequency) indicative of a ""fair"" performance to separate patients with and without PACU-D.
The baseline EEG of relaxed wakefulness as well as focused wakefulness may be used to assess the risk of developing PACU-D following surgery under general anesthesia. Moreover, routinely used monitoring parameters capture these differences as well, potentially allowing an easy transfer to clinical settings.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used to estimate DoA since EEG could reflect the effect of anesthetic drugs on the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we propose that a deep learning model consisting mainly of a deep residual shrinkage network (DRSN) and a 1 × 1 convolution network could estimate DoA in terms of patient state index (PSI) values. First, we preprocessed the four raw channels of EEG signals to remove electrical noise and other physiological signals. The proposed model then takes the preprocessed EEG signals as inputs to predict PSI values. Then we extracted 14 features from the preprocessed EEG signals and implemented three conventional feature-based models as comparisons. A dataset of 18 patients was used to evaluate the models' performances. The results of the five-fold cross-validation show that there is a relatively high similarity between the ground-truth PSI values and the predicted PSI values of our proposed model, which outperforms the conventional models, and further, that the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is 0.9344. In addition, an ablation experiment was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the soft-thresholding module for EEG-signal processing, and a cross-subject validation was implemented to illustrate the robustness of the proposed method. In summary, the procedure is not merely feasible for estimating DoA by mimicking PSI values but also inspired us to develop a precise DoA-estimation system with more convincing assessments of anesthetization levels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36679805/
36637902,Auditory stimulation and deep learning predict awakening from coma after cardiac arrest.,Brain : a journal of neurology,2023,"Aellen FM, Alnes SL, Loosli F, Rossetti AO, Zubler F, De Lucia M, Tzovara A","Assessing the integrity of neural functions in coma after cardiac arrest remains an open challenge. Prognostication of coma outcome relies mainly on visual expert scoring of physiological signals, which is prone to subjectivity and leaves a considerable number of patients in a 'grey zone', with uncertain prognosis. Quantitative analysis of EEG responses to auditory stimuli can provide a window into neural functions in coma and information about patients' chances of awakening. However, responses to standardized auditory stimulation are far from being used in a clinical routine due to heterogeneous and cumbersome protocols. Here, we hypothesize that convolutional neural networks can assist in extracting interpretable patterns of EEG responses to auditory stimuli during the first day of coma that are predictive of patients' chances of awakening and survival at 3 months. We used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to model single-trial EEG responses to auditory stimuli in the first day of coma, under standardized sedation and targeted temperature management, in a multicentre and multiprotocol patient cohort and predict outcome at 3 months. The use of CNNs resulted in a positive predictive power for predicting awakening of 0.83 ± 0.04 and 0.81 ± 0.06 and an area under the curve in predicting outcome of 0.69 ± 0.05 and 0.70 ± 0.05, for patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia and normothermia, respectively. These results also persisted in a subset of patients that were in a clinical 'grey zone'. The network's confidence in predicting outcome was based on interpretable features: it strongly correlated to the neural synchrony and complexity of EEG responses and was modulated by independent clinical evaluations, such as the EEG reactivity, background burst-suppression or motor responses. Our results highlight the strong potential of interpretable deep learning algorithms in combination with auditory stimulation to improve prognostication of coma outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36637902/

36626961,Graph approaches for analysis of brain connectivity during dexmedetomidine sedation.,Neuroscience letters,2023,"Kim PJ, Kim HT, Choi B, Shin TJ","Sedation is commonly used to relieve fear and anxiety during procedures. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1999 for short-term sedation, is a selective alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist. The use of DEX is increasing due to minimal respiratory depression and easy and quick awakening from sedation. Its sedative mechanisms are suggested to be related to changes in the interaction between brain regions. In this study, we used graph theory to investigate whether the altered network connection is associated with sedation. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of 32 channels were acquired during awake and DEX-induced sedation for 20 participants. We extracted EEG epochs from the awake and the DEX sedation state. Using the graph theory, we compared the changes in the network connection parameters with the awake state. We observed that the slopes in 1/f dynamics, which indicate overall brain network characteristics, were greater during DEX-induced sedation compared to the awake state, suggesting a transition towards a random network behavior. In addition, network connections from the perspective of information processing were significantly disturbed in the alpha frequency band, unlike other frequency bands augmenting network connections. The alpha frequency band plays a prominent role in the function and interaction of cognitive activities. These results collectively indicate that changes in the brain network critical to cognition during DEX administration may also be related to the mechanism of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36626961/

Care during TH has implications for long-term outcomes. Outcome variability exists among neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Canada, but care variations are not understood well. This study examines variations in care practices for neonates with NE treated with TH in NICUs across Canada.
A non-anonymous, web-based questionnaire was emailed to tertiary NICUs in Canada providing TH for NE to assess care practices during the first days of life and neurodevelopmental follow-up.
Ninety-two percent (24/26) responded. Centres followed national guidelines regarding the use of the modified Sarnat score to assess the initial severity of NE, the need to initiate TH within the first 6 h of birth, and the importance of follow-up. However, other practices varied, including ventilation mode, definition/treatment of hypotension, routine echocardiography, use of sedation, use of electroencephalogram (EEG), MRI timing, placental analysis, and follow-up duration.
NICUs across Canada follow available national guidelines, but variations exist in practices for managing NE during TH. Development and implementation of a consensus-based care bundle for neonates during TH may reduce practice variability and improve outcomes.
This survey describes the current HIE care practices and variation among tertiary centres in Canada. Variations exist in the care of neonates with NE treated with TH in NICUs across Canada. This paper Identifies areas of variation that are not discussed in detail in the national guidelines and will help to set up quality improvement initiatives. Elucidating the variation in care practices calls for the creation and implementation of a national, consensus-based care bundle, with the objective to improve the outcomes of these critically ill neonates.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36624286/
36616891,Improved Individualized Patient-Oriented Depth-of-Hypnosis Measurement Based on Bispectral Index.,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,"Karer G, Škrjanc I","Total intravenous anesthesia is an anesthesiologic technique where all substances are injected intravenously. The main task of the anesthesiologist is to assess the depth of anesthesia, or, more specifically, the depth of hypnosis (DoH), and accordingly adjust the dose of intravenous anesthetic agents. However, it is not possible to directly measure the anesthetic agent concentrations or the DoH, so the anesthesiologist must rely on various vital signs and EEG-based measurements, such as the bispectral (BIS) index. The ability to better measure DoH is directly applicable in clinical practice-it improves the anesthesiologist's assessment of the patient state regarding anesthetic agent concentrations and, consequently, the effects, as well as provides the basis for closed-loop control algorithms. This article introduces a novel structure for modeling DoH, which employs a residual dynamic model. The improved model can take into account the patient's individual sensitivity to the anesthetic agent, which is not the case when using the available population-data-based models. The improved model was tested using real clinical data. The results show that the predictions of the BIS-index trajectory were improved considerably. The proposed model thus seems to provide a good basis for a more patient-oriented individualized assessment of DoH, which should lead to better administration methods that will relieve the anesthesiologist's workload and will benefit the patient by providing improved safety, individualized treatment, and, thus, alleviation of possible adverse effects during and after surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36616891/

While many studies have assessed the response of these markers to propofol sedation and anesthetic gases, few studies have compared these markers when using dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist. Fifty-one patients underwent drug induced sleep endoscopy with dexmedetomidine sedation. Continuous EEG was captured using SedLine (Masimo, Inc), and a playback system was used to extract the bispectral index (BIS) (Medtronic Inc), the patient state index (PSI) (Masimo, Inc), the state and response Entropy (GE Healthcare), and calculate the spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF95). Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores were assessed continually throughout the procedure and in recovery. We assessed the correlation between EEG markers and constructed ordinal logistic regression models to predict the RASS score and compare EEG markers. All three commercial EEG metrics were significantly associated with the RASS score (p < 0.001 for all metrics) whereas SEF95 alone was insufficient at characterizing dexmedetomidine sedation. PSI and Entropy achieved higher accuracy at predicing deeper levels of sedation as compared to BIS (PSI: 58.3%, Entropy: 58.3%, BIS: 44.4%). Lightening secondary to RASS score assessment is significantly captured by all three commercial EEG metrics (p < 0.001).

While these complexes have been qualitatively assessed in previous literature, quantitative analyses are lacking. This study aims to characterize CPCs across temporal, spatial, and spectral domains.
High-density 64-electrode electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during 50 seizures acquired from 11 patients undergoing right unilateral ECT allowed for evaluation of spatiotemporal characteristics of CPCs via source localization and spectral analysis.
Peak-amplitude CPC scalp topology was consistent across seizures, showing maximal positive polarity over the midline fronto-central region and maximal negative polarity over the suborbital regions. The sources of these peak potentials were localized to the bilateral medial thalamus and cingulate cortical regions. Delta, beta, and gamma oscillations were correlated with the peak amplitude of CPCs during seizures induced during ketamine, whereas delta and gamma oscillations were associated with CPC peaks during etomidate anesthesia (excluding the dose-charge titration).
Our findings demonstrate the consistency of CPC presence across participant, stimulus charge, time, and anesthetic agent, with peaks localized to bilateral medial thalamus and cingulate cortical regions and associated with delta, beta, and gamma band oscillations (depending on the anesthetic condition).

We evaluated the spectral profile, regional connectivity and complexity of 5-minute EEG segments after each assessment. We used penalized regression to select EEG metrics associated with delirium or coma, and compared mixed-effects models predicting delirium with and without the selected EEG metrics.
Delta variability, high-beta variability, relative theta power, and relative alpha power contributed independently to EEG-based identification of delirium or coma. A model with these metrics achieved better prediction of delirium or coma than a model with clinical variables alone (Akaike Information Criterion: 36 vs 43, p = 0.006 by likelihood ratio test).

Does consciousness show itself in decibels or in bits? To address these questions, we introduce a testbed for evaluating electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarkers of consciousness using dissociations between neural oscillations and consciousness caused by rare genetic disorders. Children with Angelman syndrome (AS) exhibit sleep-like neural dynamics during wakefulness. Conversely, children with duplication 15q11.2-13.1 syndrome (Dup15q) exhibit wake-like neural dynamics during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. To identify highly generalizable biomarkers of consciousness, we trained regularized logistic regression classifiers on EEG data from wakefulness and NREM sleep in children with AS using both entropy measures of neural complexity and spectral (i.e., neural oscillatory) EEG features. For each set of features, we then validated these classifiers using EEG from neurotypical (NT) children and abnormal EEGs from children with Dup15q. Our results show that the classification performance of entropy-based EEG biomarkers of conscious state is not upper-bounded by that of spectral EEG features, which are outperformed by entropy features. Entropy-based biomarkers of consciousness may thus be highly adaptable and should be investigated further in situations where spectral EEG features have shown limited success, such as detecting covert consciousness or anesthesia awareness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36522453/

However, because of its inability to detect the activities of the brain stem and spinal cord responsible for most of the vital signs, a new biomarker for measuring the multidimensional activities of the central nervous system under anesthesia is required. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a new technique for detecting the scaling properties of nonstationary heart rate (HR) behavior. This study investigated the changes in fractal properties of heart rate variability (HRV), a nonlinear analysis, under intravenous propofol, inhalational desflurane, and spinal anesthesia. We compared the DFA method with traditional spectral analysis to evaluate its potential as an alternative biomarker under different levels of anesthesia. Eighty patients receiving elective procedures were randomly allocated different anesthesia. HRV was measured with spectral analysis and DFA short-term (4-11 beats) scaling exponent (DFAα1). An increase in DFAα1 followed by a decrease at higher concentrations during propofol or desflurane anesthesia is observed. Spinal anesthesia decreased the DFAα1 and low-/high-frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio). DFAα1 of HRV is a sensitive and specific method for distinguishing changes from baseline to anesthesia state.

Therefore, continuously delivered intravenous midazolam, propofol, or barbiturates are recommended as third-line therapy. While electroencephalographically (EEG)-controlled titration of anesthetics to seizure termination or to the emergence of an EEG burst-suppression pattern makes sense, evidence of the efficacy and tolerability of such third-line treatment is limited and concerns regarding the risks of anesthesia remain. The lack of treatment alternatives and persistent international discord reflecting contradictory results from some studies leave clinicians on their own when deciding to escalate treatment. In this conference-accompanying narrative review, we highlight the challenges of EEG-monitored third-line treatment and discuss recent studies that examined earlier administration of anesthetics.
Based on the literature, maintaining continuous burst suppression is difficult despite the constant administration of anesthetics, and the evidence for burst suppression as an adequate surrogate target is limited by methodological shortcomings as acknowledged by international guidelines. In our Swiss cohort including 102 patients with refractory status epilepticus, burst suppression as defined by the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's Critical Care EEG Terminology 2021 was established in only 21%. Besides case reports suggesting that rapid but short-termed anesthesia can be sufficient to permanently stop seizures, a study including 205 patients revealed that anesthesia as second-line treatment was associated with a shorter median duration of status epilepticus (0.5 versus 12.5 days, p < 0.001), median ICU (2 versus 5.5 days, p < 0.001) and hospital stay (8 versus 17 days, p < 0.001) with equal rates of complications when compared to anesthesia as third-line treatment.
Recent investigations have led to important findings and new insights regarding the use of anesthetics in refractory status epilepticus. However, numerous methodological limitations and remaining questions need to be considered when it comes to the translation into clinical practice, and, in consequence, call for prospective randomized studies.

Available technical approaches are limited by various constraints. We investigated the electroencephalogram (EEG) for correlates that precede or coincide with behavioural nociceptive responses to noxious stimulation.
In this retrospective study, we analysed frontal EEG recordings of 64 critical care patients who were tracheally intubated and ventilated before, during, and after tracheal suctioning. We investigated EEG power bands for correlates preceding or coinciding with behavioural responses (Behavioural Pain Scale ≥7). We applied the Mann-Whitney U-test to calculate corresponding P-values.
Strong behavioural responses were preceded by higher normalised power in the 2.5-5 Hz band (+17.1%; P<0.001) and lower normalised power in the 0.1-1.5 Hz band (-10.5%; P=0.029). After the intervention, strong behavioural responses were associated with higher normalised EEG power in the 2.5-5 Hz band (+16.6%; P=0.021) and lower normalised power in the 8-12 Hz band (-51.2%; P=0.037) CONCLUSIONS: We observed correlates in EEG band power that precede and coincide with behavioural responses to noxious stimulation. Based on previous findings, some of the power bands could be linked to processing of nociception, arousal, or sedation effects. The power bands more closely related to nociception and arousal could be used to improve monitoring of nociception and to optimise analgesic management in critical care patients.

A total of 2 min of data were created by extracting EEG signals with less noise from the measured data and the extracted data were applied with a 1-40 Hz Butterworth filter and a 50 Hz notch filter with a quality factor of 30. After that, EEG are subdivided into delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-45 Hz) bands. Finally, EEG changes in response to sound stimuli were analyzed using power spectral density and T-test validation in the frequency band.
When a sound stimulus of less than 1 KHz was stimulated by air conduction, brainstem activation was induced and the reticular activation system was activated. In addition, a great potential for replacing drugs was confirmed by inducing changes in the nervous system similar to drugs used for sedation.
These results will be able to expand the concept of digital therapeutics, and it is expected that it will be developed as a safer treatment method that can replace surgery and drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36377425/

However, how the fragmented brain networks reversibly recover during the recovery of consciousness (ROC) remains vague. This study aims to investigate the changes in brain network structure during ROC, to better understand the network fragmentation during anesthesia, thus providing insights into consciousness monitoring. We analyzed EEG data recorded from 15 individuals anesthetized by sevoflurane. By investigating the properties of functional networks generated using different brain atlases and performing community detection for functional networks, we explored the changes in brain network structure to understand how fragmented brain networks recover during the ROC. We observed an overall larger FC magnitude during LOC than in the conscious state. The ROC was accompanied by the increasing binary network efficiency, decreasing FC magnitude, and decreasing community similarity with the functional atlas. Furthermore, we observed a negative correlation between modularity and community number ( [Formula: see text] and , linear regression test), in which modularity increased and community number decreased during ROC. Our results show that a larger FC magnitude reveals excessive synchronization of neuronal activities during LOC. The increasing binary network efficiency, decreasing community number, and decreasing community similarity indicate the recovery of functional network integration. The increasing modularity implies the recovery of functional network segregation during ROC. The results suggest the limitation of FC magnitude and modularity in monitoring anesthetized states and the potential of integrated information theory to evaluate consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36374869/
36343241,Protective down-regulated states in the human brain: A possible lesson from COVID-19.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2022,"Schiff ND, Brown EN","The COVID-19 pandemic has created a large population of patients who are slow to recover consciousness following mechanical ventilation and sedation in the intensive care unit. Few clinical scenarios are comparable. Possible exceptions are the rare patients in post-cardiac arrest coma with minimal to no structural brain injuries who recovered cognitive and motor functions after prolonged delays. A common electroencephalogram (EEG) signature seen in these patients is burst suppression [8]. Biophysical modeling has shown that burst suppression is likely a signature of a neurometabolic state that preserves basic cellular function ""during states of lowered energy availability."" These states likely act as a brain protective mechanism [9]. Similar EEG patterns are observed in the anoxia resistant painted turtle [24]. We present a conceptual analysis to interpret the brain state of COVID-19 patients suffering prolonged recovery of consciousness. We begin with the Ching model and integrate findings from other clinical scenarios and studies of the anoxia-tolerant physiology of the painted turtle. We postulate that prolonged recovery of consciousness in COVID-19 patients could reflect the effects of modest hypoxic injury to neurons and the unmasking of latent neuroprotective mechanisms in the human brain. This putative protective down-regulated state appears similar to that observed in the painted turtle and suggests new approaches to enhancing coma recovery [12].",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36343241/

The Conox monitor uses two EEG indices, the qCon and the qNox. The qNox refers to the probability that a nociceptive stimulation triggers a movement of the patient and the response probability of reaction to nociceptive stimulation. We decided to test the feasibility of monitoring the qNOX index during adult cardiac surgery and to investigate whether this index correlates with hemodynamic and hormonal signs of nociceptive stimulation.
We enrolled 19 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. These were randomised to 2 groups receiving different doses of sufentanil via target controlled infusion: group A (n=9) 0.25 ng/mL and group B (n=10) 0.75 ng/mL. All patients were maintained at the same depth of anaesthesia. We recorded the Conox monitor indices (qNOX, qCON, electromyographic), hemodynamic variables and plasmatic levels of cortisol and noradrenaline.
There was significantly higher blood pressure (P=0.013) and plasmatic cortisol (P=0.003) in group A and a significant increase in plasmatic noradrenaline with increasing intensity of surgical stimulation in both groups: A (P=0.001), B (P=0.008). We found no significant corresponding changes in the qNOX index. There was a positive correlation between qNOX and hemodynamic signs of stimulation (P=0.012) and between the qNOX and EMG indices (P=0.013) after endotracheal intubation, but not later after EMG index dropped.
Our results do not support the assumption that signs of nociceptive stimulation during adult cardiac surgery will be reflected by the qNOX index. This may be related to compounding of qNOX processing and use of muscle relaxants. Further investigation on this field is needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36321735/

She was placed under invasive mechanical ventilation due to persistence of coma despite antiepileptic treatment. Despite continuous sedation with propofol, the frequency and intensity of seizure increased. Seizures were very similar to epileptic tonic-clonic seizures and were recorded with video and electroencephalogram (EEG). A diagnosis of tetanus was considered after a scalp wound was discovered. The patient's husband revealed that a trismus had appeared a few days before hospital admission after a head trauma. EEG showed a pattern of diffuse spikes, which disappeared after a cisatracurium bolus. The diagnosis of tetanus was later confirmed by cultures from wound samples. Therefore, severe tetanus can mimic both the clinical and EEG features of status epilepticus and could be added to the differential diagnosis of epilepsy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36318639/

Investigating the quantitative relationship between such a specific EEG change and the level of anesthesia has academic and clinical importance. We quantified the degree of anteriorization and investigated its detailed relationship with the level of anesthesia. We acquired 21-electrode EEG data and bispectral index (BIS) values of 50 patients undergoing surgery from before anesthesia induction until after patient arousal. For each epoch of a 10.24-s window with 1-s offsets, we calculated frontal alpha power [Formula: see text], occipital alpha power [Formula: see text], and their difference [Formula: see text] to quantify anteriorization.

We used locally weighted regression to estimate [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] at each BIS value. Thirty-six patients (26 females and 10 males aged 24-85 years) were analyzed. The 95% confidence intervals for the mean of Fisher transformations of Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] and BIS value were [- 0.68, - 0.26], [0.02, 0.62], and [- 1.11, - 0.91], respectively. The change in [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] with BIS value showed different patterns by the type of anesthetic agent, whereas that in [Formula: see text] was more consistent with smaller individual variance.

A total of 80 elderly patients aged 65 and above who underwent laparoscopic radical gastrectomy in our hospital were by convenience sampling and randomly divided into two groups : 55 groups ( group H ) and 45 groups ( group L ), 40 cases in each group. The depth of anesthesia was maintained using a closed-loop target-controlled infusion system: the EEG bispectral index was set to 55 in the H group and 45 in the L group. Venous blood samples were collected 2 h (T2), 24 h (T3) and 72 h (T4) after the start of surgery. The intraoperative dosage of propofol and remifentanil, operation duration, postoperative PACU stay time, intraoperative consciousness occurrence, postoperative hospital stay and postoperative pulmonary inflammatory events were recorded.
The patient characteristic of the two groups had no statistical difference and were comparable (P > 0.05). The intraoperative dosage of propofol in group H was lower than that in group L (P < 0.05). Compared with the L group, the plasma IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations in the H group were significantly increased at T2 (P < 0.05), and the plasma IL-10 concentration was significantly increased at T4 (P < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in both groups at T2, T3 and T4 than at T1, while at T4, the concentration of TNF-α in group H was higher than at T1 (P < 0.05).

This secondary analysis was from a prospective, multicenter study of neonates enrolled in the Neonatal Seizure Registry with seizures due to intracranial infection. Sites used continuous EEG monitoring per American Clinical Neurophysiology Society guidelines. High seizure burden was defined a priori as seven or more EEG-confirmed seizures. EEG background was categorized using standardized terminology. Primary outcome was neurodevelopment at 24-months corrected age using Warner Initial Developmental Evaluation of Adaptive and Functional Skills (WIDEA-FS). Secondary outcomes were postneonatal epilepsy and motor disability.
Twenty-seven of 303 neonates (8.9%) had seizures due to intracranial infection, including 16 (59.3%) bacterial, 5 (18.5%) viral, and 6 (22.2%) unknown. Twenty-three neonates (85%) had at least one subclinical seizure. Among 23 children with 24-month follow-up, the WIDEA-FS score was, on average, 23 points lower in children with high compared with low seizure burden (95% confidence interval, [-48.4, 2.1]; P = 0.07). After adjusting for gestational age, infection etiology, and presence of an additional potential acute seizure etiology, the effect size remained unchanged (β = -23.8, P = 0.09). EEG background was not significantly associated with WIDEA-FS score. All children with postneonatal epilepsy (n = 4) and motor disability (n = 5) had high seizure burden, although associations were not significant.

However, EEG-R usually relies on visual assessment, which requires neurophysiological expertise and is prone to inter-rater variability. We hypothesised that quantitative analysis of EEG-R obtained 3 days after patient admission can identify new markers of subsequent awakening and consciousness recovery.
In this prospective observational study of patients with severe brain injury requiring mechanical ventilation, quantitative EEG-R was assessed using standard 11-lead EEG with frequency-based (power spectral density) and functional connectivity-based (phase-lag index) analyses. Associations between awakening in the intensive care unit (ICU) and reactivity to auditory and nociceptive stimulations were assessed with logistic regression. Secondary outcomes included in-ICU mortality and 3-month Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score.
Of 116 patients, 86 (74%) awoke in the ICU. Among quantitative EEG-R markers, variation in phase-lag index connectivity in the delta frequency band after noise stimulation was associated with awakening (adjusted odds ratio=0.89, 95% confidence interval: 0.81-0.97, P=0.02 corrected for multiple tests), independently of age, baseline severity, and sedation. This new marker was independently associated with improved 3-month CRS-R (adjusted β=-0.16, standard error 0.075, P=0.048), but not with mortality (adjusted odds ratio=1.08, 95% CI: 0.99-1.18, P=0.10).
An early-stage quantitative EEG-R marker was independently associated with awakening and 3-month level of consciousness in patients with severe brain injury.

We examine novel biomarkers potentially associated with delirium, including inflammation, Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and neurodegeneration, neuroimaging markers, and neurophysiologic markers. The goal of this paper is to describe the study design and methods for the SAGES II study.
The SAGES II study is a 5-year prospective observational study of 400-420 community dwelling persons, aged 65 years and older, assessed prior to scheduled surgery and followed daily throughout hospitalization to observe for development of delirium and other clinical outcomes. Delirium is measured with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), long form, after cognitive testing. Cognitive function is measured with a detailed neuropsychologic test battery, summarized as a weighted composite, the General Cognitive Performance (GCP) score. Other key measures include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)/electroencephalography (EEG), and Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. We describe the eligibility criteria, enrollment flow, timing of assessments, and variables collected at baseline and during repeated assessments at 1, 2, 6, 12, and 18 months.

Current methods require large amounts of data and lack formal statistical inference tools. We describe here a novel approach for PAC analysis that substantially addresses these problems. We use a state space model to estimate the component oscillations, avoiding problems with frequency band selection, nonlinearities, and sharp signal transitions. We represent cross-frequency coupling in parametric and time-varying forms to further improve statistical efficiency and estimate the posterior distribution of the coupling parameters to derive their credible intervals.

A reliable biomarker for tracking delirium does not exist, but oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) could address this need. We evaluated whether the frequencies of EEG oscillations are associated with delirium onset, severity, and recovery in the postoperative period.
Twenty-six adults enrolled in the Electroencephalography Guidance of Anesthesia to Alleviate Geriatric Syndromes (ENGAGES; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02241655) study underwent major surgery requiring general anesthesia, and provided longitudinal postoperative EEG recordings for this prespecified substudy. The presence and severity of delirium were evaluated with the confusion assessment method (CAM) or the CAM-intensive care unit. EEG data obtained during awake eyes-open and eyes-closed states yielded relative power in the delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), and alpha (8-13 Hz) bands. Discriminability for delirium presence was evaluated with c-statistics. To account for correlation among repeated measures within patients, mixed-effects models were generated to assess relationships between: (1) delirium severity and EEG relative power (ordinal), and (2) EEG relative power and time (linear). Slopes of ordinal and linear mixed-effects models are reported as the change in delirium severity score/change in EEG relative power, and the change in EEG relative power/time (days), respectively. Bonferroni correction was applied to confidence intervals (CIs) to account for multiple comparisons.
Occipital alpha relative power during eyes-closed states offered moderate discriminability (c-statistic, 0.75; 98% CI, 0.58-0.87), varying inversely with delirium severity (slope, -0.67; 98% CI, -1.36 to -0.01; P = .01) and with severity of inattention (slope, -1.44; 98% CI, -2.30 to -0.58; P = .002). Occipital theta relative power during eyes-open states correlated directly with severity of delirium (slope, 1.28; 98% CI, 0.12-2.44; P = .007), inattention (slope, 2.00; 98% CI, 0.48-3.54; P = .01), and disorganized thinking (slope, 3.15; 98% CI, 0.66-5.65; P = .01).

Our group systematically searched the PubMed, Cochrane library (Central) and EMBASE for the relevant trials from their inception until September 2020. The primary endpoint was the incidence of epileptiform discharges during sevoflurane induction. The secondary endpoints were the incidence of different types of epileptiform discharges, factors associated with these epileptiform events, and other adverse events such as seizure-like movements.
After screening of 713 records, eleven studies involving 448 participants were included into the final analysis. Meta-analysis indicated that the overall incidence of Epileptiform EEG discharges was 38.1% (95%confidence interval [CI], 19.1%-59.2%) during sevoflurane anesthesia in children.

Of particular importance, sleep spindles are transient oscillatory events associated with memory consolidation, which are altered in aging and in several psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Spindle identification, however, currently contains implicit assumptions derived from what waveforms were historically easiest to discern by eye, and has recently been shown to select only a high-amplitude subset of transient events. Moreover, spindle activity is typically averaged across a sleep stage, collapsing continuous dynamics into discrete states. What information can be gained by expanding our view of transient oscillatory events and their dynamics? In this paper, we develop a novel approach to electroencephalographic phenotyping, characterizing a generalized class of transient time-frequency events across a wide frequency range using continuous dynamics. We demonstrate that the complex temporal evolution of transient events during sleep is highly stereotyped when viewed as a function of slow oscillation power (an objective, continuous metric of depth-of-sleep) and phase (a correlate of cortical up/down states). This two-fold power-phase representation has large intersubject variability-even within healthy controls-yet strong night-to-night stability for individuals, suggesting a robust basis for phenotyping. As a clinical application, we then analyze patients with schizophrenia, confirming established spindle (12-15 Hz) deficits as well as identifying novel differences in transient non-rapid eye movement events in low-alpha (7-10 Hz) and theta (4-6 Hz) ranges. Overall, these results offer an expanded view of transient activity, describing a broad class of events with properties varying continuously across spatial, temporal, and phase-coupling dimensions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36107467/

In this research, the high-density EEG of propofol-induced consciousness states alterations in 20 healthy adults were converted into cortical signals of 68 regions of interest (ROI), after alpha bandpass filtering, the pairwise orthogonal power envelope connectivity (PEC) was calculated. Then, due to the number of PECs was huge, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to select as few PECs as possible as the indicators to distinguish baseline (BS) and moderate sedation (MD) states. The results show that most PECs that can be used as indicators are related to ROI related to default mode network (DMN). At the same time, changes of thalamocortical connectivity and frontal-parietal connectivity could be observed, similar to the neuroimaging method of directly measuring cerebral cortical activity. By extracting the PEC as a classifier to classify the BS and MD States, the accuracy could reach more than 70%. Therefore, this method can not only reflect the mechanism of cortical activity alterations induced by anesthetics, but also provide a new idea for monitoring the depth of anesthesia in the future. Clinical Relevance - This shows that the high-density EEG of scalp level can be converted into cortical signals by source estimation, which is similar to the neuroimaging method of directly measuring cortical activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36085815/

The delta-alpha PAC signature during anesthetic-induced unconsciousness is gradually becoming known; however, the frequency dependence and spatial characteristics of PAC are still unclear. Multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was performed during the loss and recovery phases of consciousness in patients undergoing general anesthesia using sevoflurane. First, a spectral analysis was used to investigate the power change of the different frequency bands in the EEG signals. Second, PAC comodulogram analysis was performed to confirm the frequencies of the PAC phase drivers. Finally, to investigate the spatial characteristics of PAC, a novel PAC network was constructed using within- and cross-lead PAC, and a K-means clustering algorithm was used to identify PAC network patterns. Our results show that, in addition to the delta-alpha PAC, unconsciousness induced by sevoflurane was accompanied by spatial non-uniform alpha-gamma PAC in the cortical network, and dynamic PAC patterns between the anterior and posterior brain were observed during the unconscious phase. The dynamic transition of PAC network patterns indicates that brain states under sevoflurane-induced unconsciousness emerge from the regulation of functional integration and segregation instantiated by delta-alpha and alpha-gamma PAC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36084701/

As the literature is quite exhaustive regarding SE with motor symptoms in those patients, little is known about nonconvulsive SE (NCSE). Our aim was to compile the evidence from the literature of the frequency and outcome of NCSE in adult patients remaining in coma after resuscitation.
The medical search PubMed was screened for most relevant articles reporting the emergence and outcome of NCSE in comatose post-resuscitated adult patients.
We identified 11 cohort studies (four prospective observational, seven retrospective) including 1092 patients with SE in 29-96% and NCSE reported in 1-20%. EEG evaluation started at a median of 9.5 h (range 7.5-14.8) after cardiac arrest, during sedation and targeted temperature management (TTM). Favorable outcome after NCSE occurred in 24.5%. We found no study reporting EEG to detect or exclude NCSE in patients remaining in coma prior to the initiation of TTM and without sedation withing the first hours after ROSC.
Studies on NCSE after ROSC are scarce and unsystematic, reporting favorable outcome in every fourth patient experiencing NCSE after ROSC. This suggests that NCSE is often overlooked and outcome after NCSE is not always poor. The low data quality does not allow firm conclusions regarding the effects of NCSE on outcome calling for further investigation. In the meantime, clinicians should avoid equating NCSE after ROSC with poor prognosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36076090/

The secondary aim is to address the effects of analgesics such as morphine, on bIHS in extremely preterm infants. A total of 25 extremely preterm infants (gestational age [GA] < 28 weeks) were monitored with the continuous two-channel EEG during the first 72 h and after 1 week from birth. bIHS was analyzed using the activation synchrony index (ASI) algorithm. Microstructural development of the CC was assessed at ~ 30 and ~ 40 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA) using fractional anisotropy (FA) measurements. Multivariable regression analyses were used to assess the primary and secondary aim. Analyses were adjusted for important clinical confounders: morphine, birth weight z-score, and white matter injury score. Due to the reduced sample size, only the most relevant variables, according to literature, were included. ASI was not significantly associated with FA of the CC at 30 weeks PMA and at 40 weeks PMA (p > .5). ASI was positively associated with the administration of morphine (p < .05). Early cortical synchrony may be affected by morphine and is not associated with the microstructural development of the CC.

We sought to characterize the state-dependent effects of propofol on cortico-cortical undirected and directed FC.
We collected 256-channel high-density EEGs from 14 patients undergoing surgery while awake (AWA) or in propofol-induced moderate sedation (SED) or loss of consciousness (LOC) states. Using source-space EEG, we estimated neuronal oscillatory activity for 68 cortical regions of interest. FC was analyzed using the weighted phase lag index. Directed connectivity was computed using directed phase transfer entropy (dPTE) as a measure of information flow in the bilateral prefrontal, frontal, parietal, and occipital areas.
FC strength evidently reduced during LOC compared with those during the AWA and SED states. The dPTE analysis showed significant propofol-induced changes in directed connectivity. In the alpha band, the prefrontal-to-frontal information flow was significantly stronger in the AWA than in the SED (p = 0.033) and LOC states (p = 0.033). The parietal-to-frontal dPTE was significantly weaker during LOC than during the AWA (p = 0.033) and SED states (p = 0.007). Finally, a loss of occipital-to-frontal connectivity occurred during LOC but not the AWA state (p = 0.001). In the beta band, the dominant occipital-to-frontal direction of information flow in the AWA state was gradually converted to a frontal-to-occipital direction during LOC.
Propofol-induced unconsciousness is marked by a decrease in FC and posterior-to-anterior (feedforward) directed connectivity, which may be useful as a measure to discriminate different conscious states caused by propofol administration.
The study demonstrates that propofol produces state-dependent effects on cortico-cortical undirected and directed FC, supporting the idea that propofol induces loss of consciousness may through disrupting network interactions and cortical coordination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36067595/

Monitoring of EEG slow-wave activity (SWA) has potential in measuring sleep quality and quantity. We investigated the quantitative monitoring of nighttime SWA and its association with the clinical evaluation of sleep in patients with hyperactive ICU delirium treated with dexmedetomidine.
We performed overnight EEG recordings in 15 patients diagnosed with hyperactive delirium during moderate dexmedetomidine sedation. SWA was evaluated by offline calculation of the C-Trend Index, describing SWA in one parameter ranging 0 to 100 in values. Average and percentage of SWA values <50 were categorized as poor. The sleep quality and depth was clinically evaluated by the bedside nurse using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) with scores <70 categorized as poor.
Nighttime SWA revealed individual sleep structures and fundamental variation between patients. SWA was poor in 67%, sleep quality (RCSQ) in 67%, and sleep depth (RCSQ) in 60% of the patients. The category of SWA aligned with that of RCSQ-based sleep quality in 87% and RCSQ-based sleep depth in 67% of the patients.
Both, SWA and clinical evaluation suggested that the quality and depth of nighttime sleep were poor in most patients with hyperactive delirium despite dexmedetomidine infusion. Furthermore, the SWA and clinical evaluation classifications were not uniformly in agreement.

In our aging society the incidence of PND will increase. Hence, interdisciplinary efforts should be taken to minimize the occurrence of PND. Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring of brain activity during anesthesia or emergence from anesthesia is a promising tool to identify patients at risk. We therefore investigated whether we could identify specific EEG signatures during emergence of anesthesia that are associated with the occurrence of PND.
We performed a prospective observational investigation on 116 patients to evaluate the EEG features during emergence from general anesthesia dominated by slow delta waves in patients with and without delirium in the postoperative care unit (PACU-D) as assessed by the CAM-ICU and the RASS.
During emergence both the frontal and global EEG of patients with PACU-D were significantly different from patients without PACU-D. PACU-D patients had lower relative alpha power and reduced fronto-parietal alpha coherence.
With our analysis we show differences in EEG features associated with anesthesia emergence in patients with and without PACU-D. Frontal and global EEG alpha-band features could help to identify patients with PACU-D.

PGES following generalized seizures induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been previously linked to antidepressant response. The commonality of quiescence during both BS and PGES motivated trials to recapitulate the antidepressant effects of ECT using high doses of anesthetics. However, there have been no direct electrographic comparisons of these quiescent periods to address whether these are distinct entities.
We compared periods of EEG quiescence recorded from two human studies: BS induced in 29 healthy adult volunteers by isoflurane general anesthesia and PGES in 11 patients undergoing right unilateral ECT for treatment-resistant depression. An automated algorithm allowed detection of EEG quiescence based on a 10-microvolt amplitude threshold. Spatial, spectral, and temporal analyses compared quiescent epochs during BS and PGES.
The median (interquartile range) voltage for quiescent periods during PGES was greater than during BS (1.81 (0.22) microvolts vs 1.22 (0.33) microvolts, p < 0.001). Relative power was greater for quiescence during PGES than BS for the 1-4 Hz delta band (p < 0.001), at the expense of power in the theta (4-8 Hz, p < 0.001), beta (13-30 Hz, p = 0.04) and gamma (30-70 Hz, p = 0.006) frequency bands. Topographic analyses revealed that amplitude across the scalp was consistently higher for quiescent periods during PGES than BS, whose voltage was within the noise floor.

Measuring depth of anaesthesia is confounded by the complexity of the EEG and the fact that different agents create different pattens. A narrative review was undertaken to examine the available research evidence on the effect and reliability of spectral edge frequency (SEF) for assessing the depth of anaesthesia in adult patients under general anaesthesia. A systematic search of the PubMed®, Scopus®, CINAHL and Cochrane databases identified six randomized controlled trials and five observational studies. The findings of these studies suggest that SEF varies according to the anaesthetic drugs used. Remifentanil and age are two factors that can affect SEF, while other opioids and benzodiazepine (administered separately) seem to have no effect. No patients experienced intraoperative awareness. However, this does not indicate that SEF can provide full protection against it and the number of articles in which intraoperative awareness was studied was too small to afford any certainty. None of the studies demonstrated a reliable SEF interval associated with adequate general anaesthesia.

However, when sevoflurane was first introduced, clinicians reported isolated cases of unexpected myoclonic jerking movements during the induction in children without epilepsy. These cases raised concerns regarding the widespread use of sevoflurane particularly after reports of seizures and epileptiform electroencephalographic (EEG) discharges surfaced. The latter reports prompted recommendations to reduce the concentration of sevoflurane during induction of anesthesia. More recently, a shift away from the use of nitrous oxide has prompted some to question whether sevoflurane has a role as an induction agent in children. The preponderance of evidence supports the practice of safely inducing anesthesia with 8% sevoflurane with or without nitrous oxide in children but recommended strategies to mitigate against epileptiform discharges may be more harmful than beneficial.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35899582/

A multidisciplinary panel of international experts consisting of 21 clinicians involved in monitoring DOS in ICU patients was carefully selected on the basis of their expertise in neurocritical care and neuroanesthesiology. Panelists were assigned four domains (techniques for electroencephalography [EEG] monitoring, patient selection, use of the EEG monitors, competency, and training the principles of pEEG monitoring) from which a list of questions and statements was created to be addressed. A Delphi method based on iterative approach was used to produce the final statements. Statements were classified as highly appropriate or highly inappropriate (median rating ≥ 8), appropriate (median rating ≥ 7 but < 8), or uncertain (median rating < 7) and with a strong disagreement index (DI) (DI < 0.5) or weak DI (DI ≥ 0.5 but < 1) consensus.
According to the statements evaluated by the panel, frontal pEEG (which includes a continuous colored density spectrogram) has been considered adequate to monitor the level of sedation (strong consensus), and it is recommended by the panel that all sedated patients (paralyzed or nonparalyzed) unfit for clinical evaluation would benefit from DOS monitoring (strong consensus) after a specific training program has been performed by the ICU staff. To cover the gap between knowledge/rational and routine application, some barriers must be broken, including lack of knowledge, validation for prolonged sedation, standardization between monitors based on different EEG analysis algorithms, and economic issues.

We performed a retrospective chart review of 100 consecutive adult patients at an academic medical center who underwent rEEG monitoring for suspected non-convulsive seizures. We collected information on the timing of ASM administration and categorized EEG diagnoses as seizures (SZ), highly epileptiform patterns (HEP), or normal or slow activity (NL/SL). We used a χ² test to determine whether the use of ASMs was significantly different between SZ/HEP and NL/SL cases.
Of 100 patients, SZ were found in 5%, HEP in 14%, and no epileptiform/ictal activity in 81%. Forty-six percent of patients had received ASM(s) before rEEG. While 84% of HEP/SZ cases were started or continued on ASMs, only 51% of NL/SL cases were started or continued on ASMs after rEEG (χ² [1, n=100] = 7.09, p=0.008). Thirty-seven patients had received sedation (i.e., propofol or dexmedetomidine) prior to rEEG. In 15 patients (13/30 NL/SL, 2/7 HEP/SZ), sedation was discontinued following rEEG.
Our study demonstrates that seizures were rapidly ruled out with rEEG in 81% of patients while 19% of patients were rapidly identified as having seizures or being at higher risk for seizures. The rapid evaluation of patients correlated with a significant reduction in ASM treatment in NL/SL cases compared to HEP/SZ cases.

Although OPM-MEG and SQUID-MEG share similar data features, OPM-MEG is a wearable design that fits children and adults, and it is also robust to head motion within a magnetically shielded room. This means that OPM-MEG can potentially extend the application of MEG into the neurobiology of severe childhood epilepsies with intellectual disabilities (e.g., epileptic encephalopathies) without sedation. It is worth noting that most OPM-MEG sensors are heated, which may become an issue with large OPM sensor arrays (OPM-MEG currently has fewer sensors than SQUID-MEG).

In addition, the technical quality of all EEG tests was evaluated and rated by one neurologist (G.J.) in a blinded manner. One hundred children participated in the study. Fifty children underwent the EEG accompanied by one of two medical clowns (study group), and fifty children underwent routine EEG, without medical clowns (control group). The physician-rated technical score of the EEG recording was significantly higher in the study group (p < 0.001). Among parents of the study group, 96% were highly satisfied from the presence of the medical clowns during the EEG (median 5). Both the EEG technician and the parents denoted a significantly higher cooperation rate in the study group children, of 72% and 82%, respectively, compared to the control group. The rating of child/parent's cooperation was not correlated with age, sex, or ethnicity of the child. There was no need for sedation in the study group.
Performing EEG in young children in collaboration with medical clowns can increase the quality of the EEG recording possibly due to higher cooperation rates, which in turn lead to mutual satisfaction of both parents and technicians with the procedure.

• Performing EEG in young children may be a stressful experience. • Use of sedation during EEG may cause side effects. To avoid need for sedation various methods are used to overcome the stressful experience: Natural daytime nap, partial sleep deprivation, oral melatonine and reassurance of parents.

35803755,Emerging functional connectivity patterns during sevoflurane anaesthesia in the developing human brain.,British journal of anaesthesia,2023,"Desowska A, Berde CB, Cornelissen L","Spectral-based EEG is used to monitor anaesthetic state during surgical procedures in adults. Spectral EEG features that can resemble the patterns seen in adults emerge in children after the age of 10 months and cannot distinguish wakefulness and anaesthesia in the youngest children. There is a need to explore alternative EEG measures. We hypothesise that functional connectivity is one of the measures that can help distinguish between consciousness states in children.
An EEG data set of children undergoing sevoflurane general anaesthesia (age 0-3 yr) was reanalysed using debiased weighted phase lag index as a measure of functional connectivity in wakefulness (n=38) and anaesthesia (n=73). Network topology measures were compared between states in 0- to 6-, 6- to 10-, and >10-month-old children.
Functional connectivity was reduced in anaesthesia vs wakefulness in delta band (n=cluster of 17 significant connections; P=0.013; 58% connections surviving thresholding in wakefulness and 49% in anaesthesia). Network density and node degree were lower in anaesthesia even in the youngest children (0.57 in wakefulness; 0.48 in anaesthesia; t [9]=3.39; P=0.029; G=0.98; confidence interval [CI] [0.25-1.77]). Modularity was higher in anaesthesia (0-6 months: 0.16 in wakefulness and 0.19 in anaesthesia, t [9]=-2.95, P=0.04, G=-0.85, CI [-1.60 to -0.16]; >10 months: 0.16 vs 0.21, t [13]=-6.45, P<0.001, G=-1.62, CI [-2.49 to -0.85]) and decreased with age (ρ [73]=-0.456; P<0.001).
Anaesthesia modulates functional connectivity. Increased segregation into a more modular structure in anaesthesia decreases with age as adult-like features develop.

The division consisted of 63 faculty, 11 clinical fellows, 32 residents, and 28 nurse anesthetists at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The program was assessed for effectiveness (a significant improvement in EEG knowledge scores), scalability (training 50% of fellows and staff), and sustainability (recurring EEG lectures for 80% of rotating residents and 100% of new fellows and staff). The key drivers included educational content development (lectures, articles, and hand-outs), training a cohort of EEG TIVA trainers, intraoperative teaching (teaching points and dosing tables), decision support tools (algorithms and anesthesia electronic record pop-ups), and knowledge tests (written exam and verbal quiz during cases).
Over 12 months, 78.5% of the division (62/79) completed EEG training and test scores improved (mean score 38% before training vs 59% after training, p < .001). Didactic lectures were given to 100% of the fellows, 100% (11/11) of new staff, and 80% (4/5 blocks) of rotating residents.

In this study, we propose an intelligence model that predicts the DoA from a single channel electroencephalograph (EEG) signal. A segmentation technique based on a sliding window is employed to partition EEG signals. Hierarchical dispersion entropy (HDE) is applied to each EEG segment. A set of features is extracted from each EEG segment. The extracted features are investigated using a community graph detection approach (CGDA), and the most relevant features are selected to trace the DoA. The proposed model, based on HDE coupled with CGDA, is evaluated in term of BIS index using several statistical metrics such Q-Q plot, regression, and correlation coefficients. In addition, the proposed model is evaluated against the BIS index in the case of the poor signal quality. The results demonstrated that the proposed model showed an earlier reaction compared with the BIS index when patient's state transits from deep anaesthesia to moderate anaesthesia in the case of poor signal quality. The highest Pearson correlation coefficient obtained by the proposed is 0.96.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35790625/

We aimed to determine if EEG-guided anesthesia will result in lower sevoflurane requirements, lower incidence of burst suppression and improved emergence characteristics in children undergoing routine general anesthesia, compared to standard care.
Randomized controlled trial.
Tertiary pediatric hospital.
200 children aged 1 to 6 years, ASA 1 or 2, undergoing routine sevoflurane anesthesia for minor surgery lasting 30 to 240 min.
Children were randomized to either EEG-guided anesthesia (EEG-G) or standard care (SC). EEG-G group had sevoflurane titrated to maintain continuous slow/delta oscillations on the raw EEG and spectrogram, aiming to avoid burst suppression and, as far as possible, maintain a patient state index (PSI) between 25 and50. SC group received standard anesthesia care and the anesthesia teams were blinded to EEG waveforms.
The primary outcomes were the average end-tidal sevoflurane concentration during induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Secondary outcomes include incidence and duration of intra-operative burst suppression and Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scores.
The EEG-G group received lower end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations during induction [4.80% vs 5.67%, -0.88% (-1.45, -0.31) p = 0.003] and maintenance of anesthesia [2.23% vs 2.38%, -0.15% (-0.25, -0.05) p = 0.005], and had a lower incidence of burst suppression [3.1% vs 10.9%, p = 0.044] compared to the SC group. PAED scores were similar between groups. Children <2 years old required higher average end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations, regardless of group.
EEG-guided anesthesia care reduces sevoflurane requirements in children undergoing general anesthesia, possibly lowering the incidence of burst suppression, without altering emergence characteristics.

In this study, a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) combined with blood drug concentration and behavioral response indicators was used to monitor propofol-induced sedation and evaluate the alterations in consciousness states. Microstate analysis, which can reflect the semi-stable state of the sub-second activation of the brain functional network, can be used to assess the brain's consciousness states. In this research, the EEG microstate sequences were constructed to compare the characteristics of corresponding sequences. Compared with the baseline (BS) state, the microstate sequences in the moderate sedation (MD) state exhibited higher complexity indexes of the multiscale sample entropy. With respect to the transition probability (TP) of microstates, most microstates tended to be converted into microstate C in the BS state. In contrast, they tended to be converted into microstate F in the MD state. The significant difference between the expected TP and observed TP could lead to the conclusion that hidden layers were present when there were changes in the consciousness states. According to the hidden Markov model, the accuracy of distinguishing the BS and MD states was 80.16%.

However, these monitors are vulnerable to artefacts. In addition to the processed number, the raw frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) can be displayed as a curve on the same monitor. Anaesthesia practitioners can learn to interpret the EEG in a short tutorial and may be quicker and more accurate thanBIS in assessing anaesthesia depth by recognising EEG patterns. We hypothesise that quality of recovery (QoR) in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery is better, if propofol is titrated by anaesthesia practitioners able to interpret the EEG.

Secondary outcomes are propofol consumption, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and postoperative delirium.QoR and propofol consumption are compared between both groups using a two-sample t-test. Fisher's exact test is used to compare the incidences of PONV and delirium.

However, most anesthesia research on PAC typically focuses on delta and alpha oscillations. Studies of spatial-frequency characteristics by PAC for EEG may yield additional insights into understanding the impaired information processing under anesthesia unconsciousness and provide potential improvements in anesthesia monitoring.
Considering different frequency bands of EEG represent neural activities on different spatial scales, we hypothesized that functional coupling simultaneously appears in multiple frequency bands and specific brain regions during anesthesia unconsciousness. In this paper, PAC analysis on whole-brain EEG besides delta and alpha oscillations was investigated to understand the influence of multiple cross-frequency coordination coupling on information processing during the loss and recovery of consciousness.
EEG data from fifteen patients without cognitive diseases (7 males/8 females, aged 43.8 ± 13.4 years, weighing 63.3 ± 14.9 kilograms) undergoing lower limb surgery and sevoflurane anesthesia was recorded. To investigate the spatial-frequency characteristics of EEG source signals during loss and recovery of consciousness, the time-resolved PAC (tPAC) was calculated to reflect cross-frequency coordination in different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) and different functional regions (Visual, Limbic, Dorsal attention, Ventral attention, Default, Somatomotor, Control, Salience networks). Furthermore, different patterns (peak-max and trough-max) of PAC were examined by constructing phase-amplitude histograms using phase bins to investigate the different information processing during LOC. The multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and trend analysis were used for statistical analysis.
Theta-alpha and alpha-beta PAC were observed during sevoflurane-induced LOC, which significantly changed during loss and recovery of consciousness (F
Theta-alpha and alpha-beta PAC observed in specific brain regions represent information processing on multiple spatial scales, and the opposite patterns of PAC indicate opposite information processing on multiple spatial scales during LOC.

One of these monitors, the Entropy module, uses an algorithm to calculate the burst suppression ratio (BSR) that reflects the percentage of suppressed EEG. Automated burst suppression detection monitors may not reliably detect this EEG pattern. Hence, we evaluated the detection accuracy of BSR and investigated the EEG features leading to errors in the identification of burst suppression.
With our study, we were able to compare the performance of the BSR to the visual burst suppression detection in the raw EEG and obtain insights on the architecture of the unrecognized burst suppression phases.
We showed that the BSR did not detect burst suppression in 13 of 90 (14%) patients. Furthermore, the time comparison between the visually identified burst suppression duration and elevated BSR values strongly depended on the BSR value being used as a cutoff. A possible factor for unrecognized burst suppression by the BSR may be a significantly higher suppression amplitude ( P = .002). Six of the 13 patients with undetected burst suppression by BSR showed intraoperative state entropy values >80, indicating a risk of awareness while being in burst suppression.

There is a need to improve monitoring and management of sedation in mechanically ventilated patients. Remote technologies that are based on automated analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) could enhance standard care and alert clinicians real-time when severe EEG suppression or other abnormal brain states are detected.
High rates of drug-induced coma as well as delirium were found in several large cohorts of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, high doses of sedatives comparable to general anesthesia have been commonly administered without defined EEG endpoints. Continuous limited-channel EEG can reveal pathologic brain states such as burst suppression, that cannot be diagnosed by neurological examination alone. Recent studies documented that machine learning-based analysis of continuous EEG signal is feasible and that this approach can identify burst suppression as well as delirium with high specificity.

Targeted strategies could enhance implementation feasibility. We aimed to validate previously published findings regarding the optimal CEEG duration to identify ES in critically ill children.
This was a prospective observational study of 1,399 consecutive critically ill children with encephalopathy. We validated the findings of a multistate survival model generated in a published cohort ( N = 719) in a new validation cohort ( N = 680). The model aimed to determine the CEEG duration at which there was <15%, <10%, <5%, or <2% risk of experiencing ES if CEEG were continued longer. The model included baseline clinical risk factors and emergent EEG risk factors.
A model aiming to determine the CEEG duration at which a patient had <10% risk of ES if CEEG were continued longer showed similar performance in the generation and validation cohorts. Patients without emergent EEG risk factors would undergo 7 hours of CEEG in both cohorts, whereas patients with emergent EEG risk factors would undergo 44 and 36 hours of CEEG in the generation and validation cohorts, respectively. The <10% risk of ES model would yield a 28% or 64% reduction in CEEG hours compared with guidelines recommending CEEG for 24 or 48 hours, respectively.
This model enables implementation of a data-driven strategy that targets CEEG duration based on readily available clinical and EEG variables. This approach could identify most critically ill children experiencing ES while optimizing CEEG use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35512186/

This international prospective observational study sought to determine the prevalence of isoelectric EEG in young children during anesthesia. The authors hypothesized that the prevalence of isoelectric events would be common worldwide and associated with certain anesthetic practices and intraoperative hypotension.
Fifteen hospitals enrolled patients age 36 months or younger for surgery using sevoflurane or propofol anesthetic. Frontal four-channel EEG was recorded for isoelectric events. Demographics, anesthetic, emergence behavior, and Pediatric Quality of Life variables were analyzed for association with isoelectric events.
Isoelectric events occurred in 32% (206 of 648) of patients, varied significantly among sites (9 to 88%), and were most prevalent during pre-incision (117 of 628; 19%) and surgical maintenance (117 of 643; 18%). Isoelectric events were more likely with infants younger than 3 months (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.57 to 7.4; P < 0.001), endotracheal tube use (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.73; P = 0.008), and propofol bolus for airway placement after sevoflurane induction (odds ratio, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.78 to 4.8; P < 0.001), and less likely with use of muscle relaxant for intubation (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.99; P = 0.046]. Expired sevoflurane was higher in patients with isoelectric events during preincision (mean difference, 0.2%; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.4; P = 0.005) and surgical maintenance (mean difference, 0.2%; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.3; P = 0.002). Isoelectric events were associated with moderate (8 of 12, 67%) and severe hypotension (11 of 18, 61%) during preincision (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.30 to 16.1; P = 0.018) (odds ratio, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.27 to 9.9; P = 0.015) and surgical maintenance (odds ratio, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.71 to 7.8; P = 0.001) (odds ratio, 7.1; 95% CI, 1.78 to 28.1; P = 0.005), and lower Pediatric Quality of Life scores at baseline in patients 0 to 12 months (median of differences, -3.5; 95% CI, -6.2 to -0.7; P = 0.008) and 25 to 36 months (median of differences, -6.3; 95% CI, -10.4 to -2.1; P = 0.003) and 30-day follow-up in 0 to 12 months (median of differences, -2.8; 95% CI, -4.9 to 0; P = 0.036).

To better understand the relationship between EEG and neuronal injury, we explored the association between EEG and neurofilament light (NfL) as a marker of neuroaxonal injury, evaluated whether highly malignant EEG patterns are reflected by high NfL levels, and explored the association of EEG backgrounds and EEG discharges with NfL.
We performed a post hoc analysis of the Target Temperature Management After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest trial. Routine EEGs were prospectively performed after the temperature intervention ≥36 hours postarrest. Patients who awoke or died prior to 36 hours postarrest were excluded. EEG experts blinded to clinical information classified EEG background, amount of discharges, and highly malignant EEG patterns according to the standardized American Clinical Neurophysiology Society terminology. Prospectively collected serum samples were analyzed for NfL after trial completion. The highest available concentration at 48 or 72 hours postarrest was used.
A total of 262/939 patients with EEG and NfL data were included. Patients with highly malignant EEG patterns had 2.9 times higher NfL levels than patients with malignant patterns and NfL levels were 13 times higher in patients with malignant patterns than those with benign patterns (95% CI 1.4-6.1 and 6.5-26.2, respectively; effect size 0.47;
Benign, malignant, and highly malignant EEG patterns reflect the extent of brain injury as measured by NfL in serum. The extent of brain injury is more strongly related to the EEG background than superimposed discharges. Combining EEG and NfL may be useful to better identify patients misclassified by single methods.

Most of the studies have extremely small number of samples (average N = 15) and studies with large number of data do not have control group. We identified EEG features that may be biomarkers for dementia with 120 subjects (dementia 10, MCI 33, against control 77).
We recorded EEG from 120 patients with dementia as they stayed in relaxed state using a single-channel EEG device while conducting real-time noise reduction and compared them to healthy subjects. Differences in EEG between patients and controls, as well as differences in patients' severity, were examined using the ratio of power spectrum at each frequency.
In comparing healthy controls and dementia patients, significant power spectrum differences were observed at 3 Hz, 4 Hz, and 10 Hz and higher frequencies. In patient group, differences in the power spectrum were observed between asymptomatic patients and healthy individuals, and between patients of each respective severity level and healthy individuals.

The primary aim of the study was to compare the response of the Bispectral Index (BIS) during emergence from anesthesia maintained by xenon and sevoflurane. To better understand the variation in response of pEEG to these agents, we also compared several EEG derived parameters relevant to pEEG monitoring during emergence. Twenty-four participants scheduled for lithotripsy were randomized to receive xenon or sevoflurane anesthesia. Participants were monitored with the BIS and had simultaneous raw EEG collected. BIS index values were compared at three key emergence timepoints: first response, eyes open and removal of airway. Two sets of EEG derived parameters, three related to the BIS: relative beta ratio, SynchFastSlow and SynchFastSlow biocoherence, and two unrelated to the BIS: spectral edge frequency and the composite cortical state, were calculated for comparison. BIS index values were significantly lower in the xenon group than the sevoflurane group at each emergence timepoint. The relative beta ratio parameter increased significantly during emergence in the sevoflurane group but not in the xenon group. The spectral edge frequency and composite cortical state parameters increased significantly in both groups during emergence. The BIS index is lower at equivalent stages of behavioural response during emergence from xenon anesthesia when compared to sevoflurane anesthesia, most likely due to differences in how these two agents influence the relative beta ratio. The spectral edge frequency and composite cortical state might better reflect emergence from xenon anaesthesia.Clinical trial number and registry Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Number: ACTRN12618000916246.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441313/

Prospectively collected records of adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) who were started on ECMO support in July 2016 to December 2020 at a single tertiary center were analyzed. cEEGs were performed on patients on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients receiving sedation that affect cEEG reactivity at the start of cEEG recording, including propofol, ketamine, or benzodiazepines, were excluded. We allowed fentanyl and dexmedetomidine during cEEG monitoring. cEEGs were evaluated for frequency, amplitude, variability, reactivity, and state changes.
Of 290 patients, 40 underwent cEEG in the absence of confounding sedation (median age 60 years, 85% venoarterial-ECMO, 15% venovenous-ECMO). The median length of ECMO support and analyzable cEEG were 143 h and 24 h, respectively. A total of 27 patients underwent withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies (WOLST) during ECMO support. Of the 13 who weaned off ECMO, 9 underwent WOLST later in the hospitalization and 4 survived at hospital discharge. Decisions of WOLST were not influenced by cEEG features' results. Proportions of present EEG reactivity, present state changes, and fair/good variability were significantly higher in patients who survived compared with those who died (odds ratios infinity, infinity, and 13.57, respectively; p values < 0.001, < 0.001, and 0.0299, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity for survival at discharge were 100% and 91.67% for intact reactivity, 100% and 97.20% for present state changes, and 75% and 83.3% for fair/good variability.
Although future multicenter studies with larger patient cohorts are certainly warranted, we were able to validate the feasibility of protocolized sedation cessation and cEEG analyses in the absence of a confounding effect from sedating medications. Moreover, we demonstrate some evidence that cEEG features of intact reactivity, present state changes, and fair/good variability in comatose patients on ECMO may be associated with survival at hospital discharge.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35411539/

Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as an objective means of characterizing brain altered arousal and/or cognition states induced by anesthetics in real-time. Different general anesthetics affect cerebral electrical activities in different ways. However, the performance of conventional machine learning models on EEG data is unsatisfactory due to the low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in the EEG signals, especially in the office-based anesthesia EEG setting. Deep learning models have been used widely in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to perform classification and pattern recognition tasks due to their capability of good generalization and handling noises. Compared to other BCI applications, where deep learning has demonstrated encouraging results, the deep learning approach for classifying different brain consciousness states under anesthesia has been much less investigated. In this paper, we propose a new framework based on meta-learning using deep neural networks, named Anes-MetaNet, to classify brain states under anesthetics. The Anes-MetaNet is composed of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract power spectrum features, and a time consequence model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture the temporal dependencies, and a meta-learning framework to handle large cross-subject variability. We use a multi-stage training paradigm to improve the performance, which is justified by visualizing the high-level feature mapping. Experiments on the office-based anesthesia EEG dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Anes-MetaNet by comparison of existing methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35404821/

However, the impact of carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum on the body during laparoscopic surgery has attracted the attention of many scholars. Pneumoperitoneum can cause increased cerebral blood flow and increased intracranial pressure, cerebral metabolic rate is highly correlated with blood carbon dioxide partial pressure, and cerebral metabolism without cardiopulmonary bypass is linearly correlated with the depth of anesthesia. Electroencephalographic (EEG) bispectral index (BIS) is a signal analysis method, which can directly measure the effect of drugs on the cerebral cortex and reflect the depth of anesthesia. Based on this, this study takes smart medical treatment as the background and uses the improved BP neural network as a tool to explore the effect of carbon dioxide on EEG bispectral index under intravenous target-controlled anesthesia. The main purpose is to observe the correlation between arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure and EEG bispectral index under propofol target-controlled anesthesia during retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery.

This method was applied to 60 patients who underwent elective laparoscopic gynecological surgery in our hospital from February to August 2016. Inclusion criteria were ASA i ∼ ii; the average age was (37.8 ± 6.6) years from 20 to 50 years old; the average body weight was (51.53 ± 3.87) kg; conscious and no communication barriers; and patients without instrument ventilation. The patients were divided into observation group and control group according to the random number table method, with 30 patients in each group. The two groups were anesthetized with the same anesthetic drugs, and their consciousness index was monitored. IoC values were recorded before induction of anesthesia (T0), 5 min after intubation (T1), 5 min after operation (T2), intraoperative exploration (T3), at the end of operation (T4), 1 min before extubation (T5), and 5 min after extubation (T6). The dosage of anesthetic drugs, operation time, extubation time, and operation time of the two groups were statistically analyzed. Compared with the operation time of patients in the two groups, the extubation time, awake time, and time out of the operating room of patients in the control group were longer than the observation group. The IoC values of patients in the control group at T0 and T6 time points were lower than those in the observation group at each time point from T1 to T5. Comparison of perioperative dose of remifentanil and atracurium between the two groups was performed. The control group used more propofol dose in perioperative period. The application of neuroelectric signal in laparoscopic gynecological surgery to detect changes in perioperative IoC value can well reflect the level of consciousness of patients and reflect the effect of perioperative stimulation at different time points on the EEG of patients in real time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35386725/

We describe the case of a 22-year-old female previously diagnosed with KLS who was scheduled to have her third molars extracted under general anesthesia. Because the patient had symptoms of periodic hypersomnia and hyperphagia, the surgery was scheduled during a KLS crisis interval. General anesthesia was induced with propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium, and maintained with desflurane and remifentanil. To prevent overuse of anesthetic agents, an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based depth of anesthesia monitor (SedLine; Masimo Corporation) was used intraoperatively. A neuromuscular monitor was also used to carefully titrate use of a neuromuscular blocking agent. After surgery, sugammadex was administered, and the patient quickly emerged within 10 minutes, as also confirmed by the EEG monitor. She had no KLS recurrence postoperatively. When anesthetizing patients with KLS, an EEG-based depth of anesthesia monitor and neuromuscular monitor may be warranted to ensure complete emergence from general anesthesia.

Electroencephalographical (EEG) microstates are proposed as the neurophysiological correlates of these transiently stable brain states that last for fractions of seconds. To further understand the link between EEG microstate dynamics and consciousness, we continuously recorded high-density EEG in 23 surgical patients from their awake state to unconsciousness, induced by step-wise increasing concentrations of the intravenous anesthetic propofol. Besides the conventional parameters of microstate dynamics, we introduce a new implementation of a method to estimate the complexity of microstate sequences. The brain activity under the surgical anesthesia showed a decreased sequence complexity of the stereotypical microstates, which became sparser and longer-lasting. However, we observed an initial increase in microstates' temporal dynamics and complexity with increasing depth of sedation leading to a distinctive ""U-shape"" that may be linked to the paradoxical excitation induced by moderate levels of propofol. Our results support the idea that the brain is in a metastable state under normal conditions, balancing between order and chaos in order to flexibly switch from one state to another. The temporal dynamics of EEG microstates indicate changes of this critical balance between stability and transition that lead to altered states of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35364276/

MD affects 1 in 4,000 persons and is often an unfamiliar topic to the anesthesia provider. This review aims to inform the anesthetist on important considerations in perioperative management of MD. Patients with MD have impaired mitochondrial energy formation pathways affecting function of cardiac, central nervous, and musculoskeletal systems. All general anesthetics interfere with these mitochondrial bioenergetic pathways. MD patients exhibit hypersensitivity to volatile anesthetics. Propofol interferes with mitochondrial function via multiple pathways thus its use should be limited. MD is not at increased risk for malignant hyperthermia and should not be managed with prolonged propofol infusion. Succinylcholine is contraindicated due to hyperkalemia and myotonic risks. Nondepolarizing agents should be used with caution given unpredictable effects. No single anesthetic plan has been found to be safer than another in patients with MD. Intravenous and volatile anesthetics should be titrated incrementally while monitoring anesthetic depth clinically or via processed electroencephalogram (EEG). All MD patients should be optimized by minimizing fasting times, careful fluid selection to avoid lactate, and hypervigilant temperature management aimed at reducing the detrimental effects of catabolic stress during the perioperative period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35343897/

Serial measurements of EEG power and cognitive task performance were assessed relative to pre-intervention baseline. Mixed-effects models allowed quantification of PDR and neurocognitive trajectories after return of responsiveness (ROR).
Individuals in the control group showed stability in the PDR peak frequency over several hours (median difference/inter-quartile range [IQR] of 0.02/0.20 Hz, P=0.39).

This updated systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the effect of processed electroencephalography (pEEG)-guided general anaesthesia during surgery on POD incidence.
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) electronic databases. Studies of adult patients having general anaesthesia for any surgery where pEEG was used and POD was an outcome measure were included. Full-text reports of RCTs published from database inception until August 28, 2021, were included. Trials were excluded if sedation rather than general anaesthesia was administered, or the setting was intensive care. The primary outcome was POD assessed by validated tools. The study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO.
Nine studies, which included 4648 eligible subjects, were identified. The incidence of POD in the pEEG-guided general anaesthesia or lighter pEEG target group was 19.0% (440/2310) compared with 23.3% (545/2338) in the usual care or deeper pEEG target group (pooled odds ratio=0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.00; P=0.054). Significant heterogeneity was detected (I
Our primary analysis demonstrated a highly sensitive result with a pooled analysis of trials in which the intervention group adhered to manufacturer's recommended guidelines, showing reduced incidence of POD with pEEG guidance. High clinical heterogeneity limits inferences from this and any future meta-analyses.

We sought to identify the neural correlates of sensory disconnection and unconsciousness using a novel serial awakening paradigm.
Volunteers were recruited for sedation with dexmedetomidine i.v., propofol i.v., or natural sleep with high-density EEG monitoring and serial awakenings to establish whether subjects were in states of disconnected consciousness or unconsciousness in the preceding 20 s. The primary outcome was classification of conscious states by occipital delta power (0.5-4 Hz). Secondary analyses included derivation (dexmedetomidine) and validation (sleep/propofol) studies of EEG signatures of conscious states.
Occipital delta power differentiated disconnected and unconscious states for dexmedetomidine (area under the curve [AUC] for receiver operating characteristic 0.605 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.516; 0.694]) but not for sleep/propofol (AUC 0.512 [95% CI: 0.380; 0.645]). Distinct source localised signatures of sensory disconnection (AUC 0.999 [95% CI: 0.9954; 1.0000]) and unconsciousness (AUC 0.972 [95% CI: 0.9507; 0.9879]) were identified using support vector machine classification of dexmedetomidine data. These findings generalised to sleep/propofol (validation data set: sensory disconnection [AUC 0.743 {95% CI: 0.6784; 0.8050}]) and unconsciousness (AUC 0.622 [95% CI: 0.5176; 0.7238]). We identified that sensory disconnection was associated with broad spatial and spectral changes. In contrast, unconsciousness was associated with focal decreases in activity in anterior and posterior cingulate cortices.
These findings may enable novel monitors of the anaesthetic state that can distinguish sensory disconnection and unconsciousness, and these may provide novel insights into the biology of arousal.

Here, we empirically identify a mathematically specific critical point near which waking cortical oscillatory dynamics operate, which is known as the edge-of-chaos critical point, or the boundary between stability and chaos. We do so by applying the recently developed modified 0-1 chaos test to electrocorticography (ECoG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from the cortices of humans and macaques across normal waking, generalized seizure, anesthesia, and psychedelic states. Our evidence suggests that cortical information processing is disrupted during unconscious states because of a transition of low-frequency cortical electric oscillations away from this critical point; conversely, we show that psychedelics may increase the information richness of cortical activity by tuning low-frequency cortical oscillations closer to this critical point. Finally, we analyze clinical electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) and show that assessing the proximity of slow cortical oscillatory electrodynamics to the edge-of-chaos critical point may be useful as an index of consciousness in the clinical setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35145021/

We aimed to assess variability in coma definitions, etiologies, treatment strategies, and attitudes toward prognosis.
As part of the Neurocritical Care Society Curing Coma Campaign, between September 2020 and January 2021, we conducted an anonymous, international, cross-sectional global survey of health care professionals caring for patients with coma and disorders of consciousness in the acute, subacute, or chronic setting. Survey responses were solicited by sequential emails distributed by international neuroscience societies and social media. Fleiss κ values were calculated to assess agreement among respondents.
The survey was completed by 258 health care professionals from 41 countries. Respondents predominantly were physicians (n = 213, 83%), were from the United States (n = 141, 55%), and represented academic centers (n = 231, 90%). Among eight predefined items, respondents identified the following cardinal features, in various combinations, that must be present to define coma: absence of wakefulness (81%, κ = 0.764); Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) ≤ 8 (64%, κ = 0.588); failure to respond purposefully to visual, verbal, or tactile stimuli (60%, κ = 0.552); and inability to follow commands (58%, κ = 0.529). Reported etiologies of coma encountered included medically induced coma (24%), traumatic brain injury (24%), intracerebral hemorrhage (21%), and cardiac arrest/hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (11%). The most common clinical assessment tools used for coma included the GCS (94%) and neurological examination (78%). Sixty-six percent of respondents routinely performed sedation interruption, in the absence of contraindications, for clinical coma assessments in the intensive care unit. Advanced neurological assessment techniques in comatose patients included quantitative electroencephalography (EEG)/connectivity analysis (16%), functional magnetic resonance imaging (7%), single-photon emission computerized tomography (6%), positron emission tomography (4%), invasive EEG (4%), and cerebral microdialysis (4%). The most commonly used neurostimulants included amantadine (51%), modafinil (37%), and methylphenidate (28%). The leading determinants for prognostication included etiology of coma, neurological examination findings, and neuroimaging. Fewer than 20% of respondents reported routine follow-up of coma survivors after hospital discharge; however, 86% indicated interest in future research initiatives that include postdischarge outcomes at six (85%) and 12 months (65%).
There is wide heterogeneity among health care professionals regarding the clinical definition of coma and limited routine use of advanced coma assessment techniques in acute care settings. Coma management practices vary across sites, and mechanisms for coordinated and sustained follow-up after acute treatment are inconsistent. There is an urgent need for the development of evidence-based guidelines and a collaborative, coordinated approach to advance both the science and the practice of coma management globally.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35141860/

Recent evidence suggests that sleep increases the convection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and promotes the export of interstitial solutes, thus providing a framework to explain why all vertebrate species require sleep. Cardiovascular, respiratory and vasomotor brain pulsations have each been shown to drive CSF flow along perivascular spaces, yet it is unknown how such pulsations may change during sleep in humans. To investigate these pulsation phenomena in relation to sleep, we simultaneously recorded fast fMRI, magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG), and electroencephalography (EEG) signals in a group of healthy volunteers. We quantified sleep-related changes in the signal frequency distributions by spectral entropy analysis and calculated the strength of the physiological (vasomotor, respiratory, and cardiac) brain pulsations by power sum analysis in 15 subjects (age 26.5 ± 4.2 years, 6 females). Finally, we identified spatial similarities between EEG slow oscillation (0.2-2 Hz) power and MREG pulsations. Compared with wakefulness, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was characterized by reduced spectral entropy and increased brain pulsation intensity. These effects were most pronounced in posterior brain areas for very low-frequency (≤0.1 Hz) vasomotor pulsations but were also evident brain-wide for respiratory pulsations, and to a lesser extent for cardiac brain pulsations. There was increased EEG slow oscillation power in brain regions spatially overlapping with those showing sleep-related MREG pulsation changes. We suggest that reduced spectral entropy and enhanced pulsation intensity are characteristic of NREM sleep. With our findings of increased power of slow oscillation, the present results support the proposition that sleep promotes fluid transport in human brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35135852/

Portable EEG devices are increasingly popular in clinical monitoring applications such as sleep scoring or anesthesia monitoring. In these situations, for reasons of speed and simplicity only few electrodes are used and contamination of the EEG signal by artifacts is inevitable. Visual inspection and manual removal of artifacts is often not possible, especially in real-time applications. Our goal is to develop a flexible technique to remove EEG artifacts in these contexts with minimal supervision. We propose here a new wavelet-based method which allows to remove artifacts from single-channel EEGs. The method is based on a data-driven renormalization of the wavelet components and is capable of adaptively attenuate artifacts of different nature. We benchmark our method against alternative artifact removal techniques. We assessed the performance of the proposed method on publicly available datasets comprising ocular, muscular, and movement artifacts. The proposed method shows superior performances on different kinds of artifacts and signal-to-noise levels. Finally, we present an application of our method to the monitoring of general anesthesia. We show that our method can successfully attenuate various types of artifacts in single-channel EEG. Thanks to its data-driven approach and low computational cost, the proposed method provides a valuable tool to remove artifacts in real-time EEG applications with few electrodes, such as monitoring in special care units.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35085086/

Computer tomography and magnetic resonance were performed to investigate the relationship between electrodes' positioning and anatomical structures. The pediatric SedLine® EEG-sensor could be easily applied and SedLine®-generated variables collected. An EEG Density Spectral Array (DS) was displayed over the whole procedure. During surgery, the EEG signal was dominated by elevated power in the delta range (0.5-4 Hz), with an underlying broadband signal (where power decreased with increasing frequency). The emergence period was marked by a decrease in delta power, and a more evenly distributed power over the 4-40 Hz frequency range. From incision to end of surgery, mean SedLine®-generated values (± standard deviation) were overall stable [23.0 (± 2.8) Patient State Index (PSI), 1.0% (± 3.8%) Suppression Ratio (SR), 8.8 Hz (± 2.5 Hz) Spectral Edge Frequency 95% (SEF) left, 7.7 Hz (± 2.4 Hz) SEF right], quickly changing during emergence [75.3 (± 11.1) PSI, 0.0 (± 0.0) SR, 12.5 (± 6.6) SEF left 10.4 (± 6.6) SEF right].

It has been explored for prevention of postoperative delirium, although results have been contradictory. In this study, we investigated the association of ketamine with postoperative delirium and specific encephalographic signatures. Furthermore, we examined these associations in the context of baseline neurocognition as measured by a validated assessment.
We conducted a prospective observational study from January 2019 to December 2020. Ninety-eight patients aged ≥65 years and undergoing spine surgery scheduled for ≥3 hours were included in the study. All participants who completed the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Health Assessment preoperatively and postoperatively were assessed with the confusion assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and/or the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC). Patients had frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings (SedLine Root, Masimo, Corp) quantitatively analyzed. We used 60 seconds of artifact-free EEG (without burst suppression) extracted from the middle of the maintenance period to calculate the normalized power spectral density (PSD). Comparisons were made between those who did or did not receive ketamine and according to results from neurocognitive assessments.
Ninety-eight patients (of a total of 155, enrolled and consented) had EEG of sufficient quality for analysis (42 women). Overall, we found a significant increase in the EEG power in the moderate frequency range (10-20 Hz) in patients that received ketamine. When the patients were divided by their preoperative cognitive status, this result in the ketamine group only held true for the cognitively normal patients. Patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline did not demonstrate a significant change in EEG characteristics based on ketamine administration, but impaired patients that received ketamine had a significantly higher rate of postoperative delirium (52% ketamine versus 20% no ketamine) (odds ratio [OR], 4.36; confidence interval [CI], 1.02-18.22; P = .048). In patients determined to be preoperatively cognitively normal, the incidence of postoperative delirium was not significantly associated with ketamine administration (19% ketamine versus 17% no ketamine) (OR, 1.10; CI, 0.30-4.04; P = .5833).
Ketamine-related changes in EEG are observed in a heterogeneous group of patients receiving spine surgery. This result was driven primarily by the effect of ketamine on cognitively normal patients and not observed in patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline. Furthermore, patients who were cognitively impaired at baseline and who had received ketamine were more likely to develop postoperative delirium, suggesting that cognitive vulnerability might be predicted by the lack of a neurophysiologic response to ketamine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35051953/
35041633,Decreased Electroencephalographic Alpha Power During Anesthesia Induction Is Associated With EEG Discontinuity in Human Infants.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2022,"Chao JY, Gutiérrez R, Legatt AD, Yozawitz EG, Lo Y, Adams DC, Delphin ES, Shinnar S, Purdon PL","Electroencephalogram (EEG) discontinuity can occur at high concentrations of anesthetic drugs, reflecting suppression of electrocortical activity. This EEG pattern has been reported in children and reflects a deep state of anesthesia. Isoelectric events on the EEG, a more extreme degree of voltage suppression, have been shown to be associated with worse long-term neurologic outcomes in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery. However, the clinical significance of EEG discontinuities during pediatric anesthesia for noncardiac surgery is not yet known and merits further research. In this study, we assessed the incidence of EEG discontinuity during anesthesia induction in neurologically normal infants and the clinical factors associated with its development. We hypothesized that EEG discontinuity would be associated with sevoflurane-induced alpha (8-12 Hz) power during the period of anesthesia induction in infants.
We prospectively recorded 26 channels of EEG during anesthesia induction in an observational cohort of 54 infants (median age, 7.6 months; interquartile range [IQR] [4.9-9.8 months]). We identified EEG discontinuity, defined as voltage amplitude <25 microvolts for >2 seconds, and assessed its association with sevoflurane-induced alpha power using spectral analysis and multivariable logistic regression adjusting for clinically important variables.
EEG discontinuity was observed in 20 of 54 subjects (37%), with a total of 25 discrete events. Sevoflurane-induced alpha power in the posterior regions of the head (eg, parietal or occipital regions) was significantly lower in the EEG discontinuity group (midline parietal channel on the electroencephalogram, International 10-20 System [Pz]; 8.3 vs 11.2 decibels [dBs]; P = .004), and this association remained after multivariable adjustment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.51 per dB increase in alpha power [95% CI, 0.30-0.89]; P = .02). There were no differences in the baseline (unanesthetized) EEG between groups in alpha power or power in any other frequency band.
We demonstrate that EEG discontinuity is common during anesthesia induction and is related to the level of sevoflurane-induced posterior alpha power, a putative marker of cortical-thalamic circuit development in the first year of life. This association persisted even after adjusting for age and propofol coadministration. The fact that this difference was only observed during anesthesia and not in the baseline EEG suggests that otherwise hidden brain circuit properties are unmasked by general anesthesia. These neurophysiologic markers observed during anesthesia may be useful in identifying patients who may have a greater chance of developing discontinuity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35041633/
35007718,Dynamic reconfiguration of frequency-specific cortical coactivation patterns during psychedelic and anesthetized states induced by ketamine.,NeuroImage,2022,"Li D, Vlisides PE, Mashour GA","Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that spontaneous brain activity exhibits rich spatiotemporal structure that can be characterized as the exploration of a repertoire of spatially distributed patterns that recur over time. The repertoire of brain states may reflect the capacity for consciousness, since general anesthetics suppress and psychedelic drugs enhance such dynamics. However, the modulation of brain activity repertoire across varying states of consciousness has not yet been studied in a systematic and unified framework. As a unique drug that has both psychedelic and anesthetic properties depending on the dose, ketamine offers an opportunity to examine brain reconfiguration dynamics along a continuum of consciousness. Here we investigated the dynamic organization of cortical activity during wakefulness and during altered states of consciousness induced by different doses of ketamine. Through k-means clustering analysis of the envelope data of source-localized electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, we identified a set of recurring states that represent frequency-specific spatial coactivation patterns. We quantified the effect of ketamine on individual brain states in terms of fractional occupancy and transition probabilities and found that ketamine anesthesia tends to shift the configuration toward brain states with low spatial variability. Furthermore, by assessing the temporal dynamics of the occurrence and transitions of brain states, we showed that subanesthetic ketamine is associated with a richer repertoire, while anesthetic ketamine induces dynamic changes in brain state organization, with the repertoire richness evolving from a reduced level to one comparable to that of normal wakefulness before recovery of consciousness. These results provide a novel description of ketamine's modulation of the dynamic configuration of cortical activity and advance understanding of the neurophysiological mechanism of ketamine in terms of the spatial, temporal, and spectral structures of underlying whole-brain dynamics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007718/

We determined whether sevoflurane anesthesia preferentially enhances this metric within the epileptogenic zone.
This is an observational study of intraoperative electrocorticography data from 621 electrodes chronically implanted into eight patients with drug-resistant, focal epilepsy. All patients were anesthetized with sevoflurane during resective surgery, which subsequently resulted in seizure control. We classified 'removed' and 'retained' brain sites as epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic, respectively. Mixed model analysis determined which anesthetic stage optimized MI-based classification of epileptogenic sites.
MI increased as a function of anesthetic stage, ranging from baseline (i.e., oxygen alone) to 2.0 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane, preferentially at sites showing higher initial MI values. This phenomenon was accentuated just prior to sevoflurane reaching 2.0 MAC, at which time, the odds of a site being classified as epileptogenic were enhanced by 86.6 times for every increase of 1.0 MI.
Intraoperative MI best localized the epileptogenic zone immediately before sevoflurane reaching 2.0 MAC in this small cohort of patients.

Propofol-remifentanil anesthesia was guided either by SedLine (EEG-guided care, n=779) or not (usual care, n=781). The goal of EEG-guided care was to maintain spectral edge frequency between 10 and 15 and patient state index (PSI) between 25 and 50. The primary outcome was the incidence of POD on postoperative days 1 to 5. The secondary outcomes included emergence delirium, composite moderate-to-severe complications, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission, 30-day hospital readmission and all-cause mortality, and intraoperative awareness.
Of the 1560 randomized patients, 1545 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The median propofol administered for anesthesia maintenance was 900 mg and 1000 mg in the EEG-guided and usual care groups, respectively (P=0.21). POD occurred in 1.0% (8/771) and 1.2% (9/774) of patients in the EEG-guided and usual care groups, respectively (risk ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.35-2.30). There were no between-group differences in all secondary outcome measures. Emergence delirium occurred in 11.8% (91/771) and 13.2% (102/774) of the EEG-guided care and usual care groups, respectively (risk ratio: 0.90; 95% confidence interval: 0.69-1.17; P=0.41). Three patients from each group reported intraoperative awareness.
Compared with usual care, SedLine spectral edge frequency-guided and patient state index-guided propofol-remifentanil anesthetic care neither alters anesthetic delivery nor decreases the unexpected low incidence of POD in relatively young Chinese patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882106/
34862586,Processed intraoperative burst suppression and postoperative cognitive dysfunction in a cohort of older noncardiac surgery patients.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2022,"Dustin Boone M, Lin HM, Liu X, Kim J, Sano M, Baxter MG, Sieber FE, Deiner SG","Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a decline in cognitive test performance which persists months after surgery. There has been great interest in the anesthesia community regarding whether variables generated by commercially available processed EEG monitors originally marketed to prevent awareness under anesthesia can be used to guide intraoperative anesthetic management to prevent POCD. Processed EEG monitors represent an opportunity for anesthesiologists to directly monitor the brain even if they have not been trained to interpret EEG waveforms. There is continued equipoise regarding whether any of the variables generated by the machines' interpretation of raw data are associated with POCD. Most literature has focused on the depth of anesthesia number, however recent studies have shown that processed depth may not be accurate in older age groups due to reduced alpha band power. Burst suppression is an encephalographic pattern of high voltage activity alternating with periods of electrical silence and is another marker of depth which can be obtained from commercial processed EEG monitors. We performed a prospective cohort study to determine whether burst suppression and burst suppression ratio as measured by the BIS Monitor (Bispectral Index, BIS Medtronic, Boulder CO), is associated with cognitive dysfunction 3 months after surgery. We recruited 167 elective surgery patients, 65 years of age and older, anticipated to require at least 2 day inpatient admission. Our main outcome measure was cognitive decline in composite z-score on the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center UDS Battery of at least 1 standard deviation 3 months after surgery relative to preoperative baseline. 14% experienced POCD, this group was older (72 [70, 74] versus 70 [67, 75] years), and had frailty scores as measured by the FRAIL Scale (2 [0, 3] versus 1 [0, 2]) and lower baseline z-scores (- 0.2 [- 0.6, 0.5] versus 0.1 [- 0.3, 0.5]). There was a univariable association between suppression ratio > 10 (SR > 10) and POCD (4.8 [0, 37.3] versus 15.4 [4.0-142.4] min), p = .038. However, after adjustment this relationship did not persist, only anesthetic technique, age, and pain remained in the model. In our cohort of older elective noncardiac surgery patients we found a marginal association between processed burst suppression (total burst suppression p = .067, SR > 5 p = .052, SR > 10.038) which did not persist in a multivariable model. Patients with POCD had almost twice the number of minutes of burst suppression, and three times the amount of time for SR > 5 and > 10. Our finding may be a limitation of the monitor's ability to detect burst suppression. The consistent trend towards more intraoperative burst suppression in patients who developed POCD suggests that future studies are needed to investigate the relationship of raw intraoperative burst suppression and POCD.Trial registry Clinical trial number and registry URL: Optimizing Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction in the Elderly-PRESERVE, Clinical Trials Gov# NCT02650687; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02650687 .",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34862586/

The hypothetical questions in this survey include: (1) Chinese anaesthesiologists mainly use the depth of anaesthesia (DoA) monitors to prevent intraoperative awareness and (2) the accuracy of these monitors is the most crucial performance factor during the clinical daily practice of Chinese anaesthesiologists.
We collected and statistically analysed the response of a total of 12,750 anesthesiologists who were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. The Chinese Society of Anaesthesiologists (CSA) trial group provided the email address of each anaesthesiologist, and the selection of respondents was random from the computerized system.
The overall response rate was 32.0% (4037 respondents). Only 9.1% (95% confidence interval, 8.2-10.0%) of the respondents routinely used DoA monitors. Academic respondents (91.5, 90.3-92.7%) most frequently used DoA monitoring to prevent awareness, whereas nonacademic respondents (88.8, 87.4-90.2%) most frequently used DoA monitoring to guide the delivery of anaesthetic agents. In total, the number of respondents who did not use a DoA monitor and whose patients experienced awareness (61.7, 57.8-65.6%) was significantly greater than those who used one or several DoA monitors (51.5, 49.8-53.2%). Overall, the crucial performance factor during DoA monitoring was considered by 61.9% (60.4-63.4%) of the respondents to be accuracy. However, most respondents (95.7, 95.1-96.3%) demanded improvements in the accuracy of the monitors for DoA monitoring. In addition, broad application in patients of all ages (86.3, 85.2-87.4%), analgesia monitoring (80.4, 79.2-81.6%), and all types of anaesthetic agents (75.6, 74.3-76.9%) was reported. In total, 65.0% (63.6-66.5%) of the respondents believed that DoA monitors should be combined with EEG and vital sign monitoring, and 53.7% (52.1-55.2%) believed that advanced DoA monitors should include artificial intelligence.
Academic anaesthesiologists primarily use DoA monitoring to prevent awareness, whereas nonacademic anaesthesiologists use DoA monitoring to guide the delivery of anaesthetics. Anaesthesiologists demand high-accuracy DoA monitors incorporating EEG signals, multiple vital signs, and antinociceptive indicators. DoA monitors with artificial intelligence may represent a new direction for future research on DoA monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34814841/

Therefore, it is of interest to combine both EEG and HRV. However, irregular nature of time spans between adjacent heartbeats makes the HRV hard to be directly fused with EEG timeseries. Current study performed a pioneering work in integrating EEG-HRV information in a single marker called cumulant ratio, quantifying how far EEG dynamics deviate from self-similarity compared to HRV dynamics. Experimental data recorded using BrainStatus device with single ECG and 10 EEG channels from healthy-brain patients undergoing operation (N = 20) were used for the validation of the proposed method. Our analyses show that the EEG to HRV ratio of first, second and third cumulants gets systematically closer to zero with increase in depth of anesthesia, respectively 29.09%, 65.0% and 98.41%. Furthermore, extracting multifractality properties of both heart and brain activities and encoding them into a 3-sample numeric code of relative cumulants does not only encapsulates the comparison of two evenly and unevenly spaced variables of EEG and HRV into a concise unitless quantity, but also reduces the impact of outlying data points.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34784279/

The Neonatal Seizure Registry is a multicenter, prospectively acquired cohort of neonates with clinical or electroencephalographic (EEG)-confirmed seizures. Cardiopulmonary disease was defined as congenital heart disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and exposure to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We assessed continuous EEG monitoring strategy, seizure characteristics, seizure management, and outcomes for neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease.
We evaluated 83 neonates with cardiopulmonary disease and 271 neonates without cardiopulmonary disease. Neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were more likely to have EEG-only seizures (40% vs 21%, P < .001) and experience their first seizure later than those without cardiopulmonary disease (174 vs 21 hours of age, P < .001), but they had similar seizure exposure (many-recurrent electrographic seizures 39% vs 43%, P = .27). Phenobarbital was the primary initial antiseizure medication for both groups (90%), and both groups had similarly high rates of incomplete response to initial antiseizure medication administration (66% vs 68%, P = .75). Neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were discharged from the hospital later (hazard ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.25-0.45, P < .001), although rates of in-hospital mortality were similar between the groups (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.66-1.94, P = .64).
Neonates with and without cardiopulmonary disease had a similarly high seizure exposure, but neonates with cardiopulmonary disease were more likely to experience EEG-only seizures and had seizure onset later in the clinical course. Phenobarbital was the most common seizure treatment, but seizures were often refractory to initial antiseizure medication. These data support guidelines recommending continuous EEG in neonates with cardiopulmonary disease and indicate a need for optimized therapeutic strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34728234/

Ripples on oscillations (RonO, 80-250 Hz), ripples on spikes (RonS), sharp-spikes, fast RonO (fRonO, 250-600 Hz), and fast RonS (fRonS) were semi-automatically detected. HFO power and frequency were compared between the conditions using a generalized linear mixed-effects model. HFO rates were compared using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with anesthesia type and SOZ as factors. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis quantified seizure onset zone (SOZ) classification accuracy, and the scalar product was used to assess spatial reliability. Resection of contacts with the highest rate of events was compared with outcome. During sleep, all HFOs, except fRonO, were larger in amplitude compared to intraoperatively (p < 0.01). HFO frequency was also affected (p < 0.01). Anesthesia selection affected HFO and sharp-spike rates. In both conditions combined, sharp-spikes and all HFO subtypes were increased in the SOZ (p < 0.01). However, the increases were larger during the sleep recordings (p < 0.05). The area under the ROC curves for SOZ classification were significantly smaller for intraoperative sharp-spikes, fRonO, and fRonS rates (p < 0.05). HFOs and spikes were only significantly spatially reliable for a subset of the patients (p < 0.05). A failure to resect fRonO areas in the sleep recordings trended the most sensitive and accurate for predicting failure. In summary, HFO morphology is altered by anesthesia. Intraoperative SEEG recordings exhibit increased rates of HFOs in the SOZ, but their spatial distribution can differ from sleep recordings. Recording these biomarkers during non-REM sleep offers a more accurate delineation of the SOZ and possibly the epileptogenic zone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34725412/
34715426,Ketamine induces EEG oscillations that may aid anesthetic state but not dissociation monitoring.,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,2021,"Chamadia S, Gitlin J, Mekonnen J, Ethridge BR, Ibala R, Colon KM, Qu J, Akeju O","Ketamine is an anesthetic drug associated with dissociation. Decreased electroencephalogram alpha (8-13 Hz) and low-beta (13-20 Hz) oscillation power have been associated with ketamine-induced dissociation. We aimed to characterize surface electroencephalogram signatures that may serve as biomarkers for dissociation.
We analyzed data from a single-site, open-label, high-density surface electroencephalogram study of ketamine anesthesia (2 mg/kg, n = 15). We assessed dissociation longitudinally using the Clinician Administered Dissociation States Scale (CADSS) and administered midazolam to attenuate dissociation and enable causal inference. We analyzed electroencephalogram power and global coherence with multitaper spectral methods. Mixed effects models were used to assess whether power and global coherence signatures of ketamine could be developed into dissociation-specific biomarkers.
Compared to baseline, ketamine unresponsiveness was associated with increased frontal power between 0.5 to 9.3 Hz, 12.2 to 16.6 Hz, and 24.4 to 50 Hz. As subjects transitioned into a responsive but dissociated state (mean CADSS ± SD, 22.1 ± 17), there was a decrease in power between 0.5 to 10.3 Hz and 11.7 to 50 Hz. Midazolam reduced dissociation scores (14.3 ± 11.6), decreased power between 4.4 to 11.7 Hz and increased power between 14.2 to 50 Hz. Our mixed-effects model demonstrated a quadratic relationship between time and CADSS scores. When models (frontal power, occipital power, global coherence) were reanalyzed with midazolam and electroencephalogram features as covariates, only midazolam was retained.
Ketamine is associated with structured electroencephalogram power and global coherence signatures that may enable principled anesthetic state but not dissociation monitoring.

Therefore, it is essential to construct an effective spectrum and spectrogram to analyze the relationship between the depth of anesthesia and the EEG frequency during general anesthesia. This paper reviews the computer programming techniques for analyzing the spectrum and spectrogram derived from a single-channel EEG recorded during general anesthesia. A periodogram is obtained by repeating a Fourier transform on EEG segments separated by short time intervals, but spectral leakage (i.e., dissociation from the true spectrum) occurs as a consequence of unnatural segmentation and noise. While offsetting the securing of the dynamic range, practical analyses of the adaptation of the window function are explained. Finally, the multitaper method, which can suppress artifacts caused by the edges of the analysis segments, suppress noise, and probabilistically infer values that are close to the real power spectral density, is explained using practical examples of the analysis. All analyses were performed and all graphs plotted using Python under Jupyter Notebook.

Yet, it is unclear how best to teach trainees to interpret EEG time series data and the corresponding spectral information for intraoperative anesthetic titration, or what effect this might have on outcomes.
We developed an electronic learning curriculum (ELC) that covered EEG spectrogram interpretation and its use in anesthetic titration. Anesthesiology residents at a single academic center were randomized to receive this ELC and given spectrogram monitors for intraoperative use versus standard residency curriculum alone without intraoperative spectrogram monitors. We hypothesized that this intervention would result in lower inhaled anesthetic administration (measured by age-adjusted total minimal alveolar concentration [MAC] fraction and age-adjusted minimal alveolar concentration [aaMAC]) to patients ≥60 old during the postintervention period (the primary study outcome). To study this effect and to determine whether the 2 groups were administering similar anesthetic doses pre- versus postintervention, we compared aaMAC between control versus intervention group residents both before and after the intervention. To measure efficacy in the postintervention period, we included only those cases in the intervention group when the monitor was actually used. Multivariable linear mixed-effects modeling was performed for aaMAC fraction and hospital length of stay (LOS; a non-prespecified secondary outcome), with a random effect for individual resident. A multivariable linear mixed-effects model was also used in a sensitivity analysis to determine if there was a group (intervention versus control group) by time period (post- versus preintervention) interaction for aaMAC. Resident EEG knowledge difference (a prespecified secondary outcome) was compared with a 2-sided 2-group paired t test.
Postintervention, there was no significant aaMAC difference in patients cared for by the ELC group (n = 159 patients) versus control group (N = 325 patients; aaMAC difference = -0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.09 to 0.03; P =.32). In a multivariable mixed model, the interaction of time period (post- versus preintervention) and group (intervention versus control) led to a nonsignificant reduction of -0.05 aaMAC (95% CI, -0.11 to 0.01; P = .102). ELC group residents (N = 19) showed a greater increase in EEG knowledge test scores than control residents (N = 20) from before to after the ELC intervention (6-point increase; 95% CI, 3.50-8.88; P < .001). Patients cared for by the ELC group versus control group had a reduced hospital LOS (median, 2.48 vs 3.86 days, respectively; P = .024).
Although there was no effect on mean aaMAC, these results demonstrate that this EEG-ELC intervention increased resident knowledge and raise the possibility that it may reduce hospital LOS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34709008/

Pronounced alpha oscillations in the frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) appear to predict favorable perioperative neurocognitive outcomes and may also provide a measure of intraoperative antinociception. Monitoring the presence and strength of these alpha oscillations can be challenging, especially in elderly patients, because the EEG in these patients may be dominated by oscillations in other frequencies. Hence, the information regarding alpha oscillatory activity may be hidden and hard to visualize on a screen. Therefore, we developed an effective approach to improve the detection and presentation of alpha activity in the perioperative setting.
We analyzed EEG records of 180 patients with a median age of 60 years (range, 18-90 years) undergoing noncardiac, nonneurologic surgery under general anesthesia with propofol induction and sevoflurane maintenance. We calculated the power spectral density (PSD) for the unprocessed EEG as well as for the time-discrete first derivative of the EEG (diffPSD) from 10-second epochs. Based on these data, we estimated the power-law coefficient κ of the PSD and diffPSD, as the EEG coarsely follows a 1/fκ distribution when displayed in double logarithmic coordinates. In addition, we calculated the alpha (7.8-12.1 Hz) to delta (0.4-4.3 Hz) ratio from the PSD as well as diffPSD.
The median κ was 0.899 [first and third quartile: 0.786, 0.986] for the unaltered PSD, and κ = -0.092 [-0.202, -0.013] for the diffPSD, corresponding to an almost horizontal PSD of the differentiated EEG. The alpha-to-delta ratio of the diffPSD was strongly increased (median ratio = -8.0 dB [-10.5, -4.7 dB] for the unaltered PSD versus 30.1 dB [26.1, 33.8 dB] for the diffPSD). A strong narrowband oscillatory alpha power component (>20% of total alpha power) was detected in 23% using PSD, but in 96% of the diffPSD.
We demonstrated that the calculation of the diffPSD from the time-discrete derivative of the intraoperative frontal EEG is a straightforward approach to improve the detection of alpha activity by eliminating the broadband background noise. This improvement in alpha peak detection and visualization could facilitate the guidance of general anesthesia and improve patient outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34677164/

However, the creation of such database is often tedious and cumbersome and involves human labor. Hence, we developed a Raspberry Pi-based system for archiving EEG signals recorded from patients under anesthesia in operating rooms (ORs) with minimal human involvement.
Using this system, we archived patient EEG signals from over 500 unique surgeries at the Emory University Orthopaedics and Spine Hospital, Atlanta, for about 18 months. For this, we developed a software package that runs on a Raspberry Pi and archives patient EEG signals from a SedLine Root EEG Monitor (Masimo) to a secure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant cloud storage. The OR number corresponding to each surgery was archived along with the EEG signal to facilitate retrospective EEG analysis. We retrospectively processed the archived EEG signals and performed signal quality checks. We also proposed a formula to compute the proportion of true EEG signal and calculated the corresponding statistics. Further, we curated and interleaved patient medical record information with the corresponding EEG signals.
We retrospectively processed the EEG signals to demonstrate a statistically significant negative correlation between the relative alpha power (8-12 Hz) of the EEG signal captured under anesthesia and the patient's age.
Our system is a standalone EEG archiver developed using low cost and readily available hardware. We demonstrated that one could create a large-scale EEG database with minimal human involvement. Moreover, we showed that the captured EEG signal is of good quality for retrospective analysis and combined the EEG signal with the patient medical records.

However, a broad analysis of the EEG dynamics including preoperative, postinduction, intraoperative and postoperative scenarios and its correlation to POD development is still lacking. We explored the relationship between perioperative EEG spectra-derived parameters and POD development, aiming to ascertain the diagnostic utility of these parameters to detect patients developing POD.
Patients aged ≥65 years undergoing elective surgeries that were expected to last more than 60 minutes were included in this prospective, observational single center study (Biomarker Development for Postoperative Cognitive Impairment [BioCog] study). Frontal EEGs were recorded, starting before induction of anesthesia and lasting until recovery of consciousness. EEG data were analyzed based on raw EEG files and downloaded excel data files. We performed multitaper spectral analyses of relevant EEG epochs and further used multitaper spectral estimate to calculate a corresponding spectral parameter.

The preoperative EEG in POD patients was associated with lower values in both SEF (POD 13.1 ± 4.6 Hz versus no postoperative delirium [NoPOD] 17.4 ± 6.9 Hz; P = .002) and corresponding γ-band power (POD -24.33 ± 2.8 dB versus NoPOD -17.9 ± 4.81 dB), as well as reduced postinduction absolute α-band power (POD -7.37 ± 4.52 dB versus NoPOD -5 ± 5.03 dB). The ratio of SEF from the preoperative to postinduction state (SEF ratio) was ~1 in POD patients, whereas NoPOD patients showed a SEF ratio >1, thus indicating a slowing of EEG with loss of unconscious. Preoperative SEF, preoperative γ-band power, and SEF ratio were independently associated with POD (P = .025; odds ratio [OR] = 0.892, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.808-0.986; P = .029; OR = 0.568, 95% CI, 0.342-0.944; and P = .009; OR = 0.108, 95% CI, 0.021-0.568, respectively).
Lower preoperative SEF, absence of slowing in EEG while transitioning from preoperative state to unconscious state, and lower EEG power in relevant frequency bands in both these states are related to POD development. These findings may suggest an underlying pathophysiology and might be used as EEG-based marker for early identification of patients at risk to develop POD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34591807/

To objectively assess the stress associated with dental treatment in children, based on the autonomic nervous activity and the electroencephalogram (EEG).
Twenty-two children aged 4-9 years were recruited from outpatients of a paediatric clinic. Electrocardiogram and EEG were recorded throughout the treatment to analyze the autonomic nervous activities and the powers of brain waves, respectively. Changes in these measurements during each treatment process were evaluated in two age groups: 4-6 years and 6-9 years.
Elevations in sympathetic activities accompanied by decreased parasympathetic activities induced by stress were observed during rubber dam setting (RD) in the age group of 4-6 years and during infiltration anesthesia (IA), RD, and cavity preparation with a dental turbine (CP-T) in the age group of 6-9 years. Stress-related beta wave increments in EEG were observed during IA and CP-T in the age group of 6-9 years but not in the age group of 4-6 years.
Monitoring the autonomic nervous activities during treatments is useful in assessing stresses in a wide age of young children, whereas EEG monitoring is applicable only to children older than 6 years.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34558749/
34543237,The Strength of Alpha Oscillations in the Electroencephalogram Differently Affects Algorithms Used for Anesthesia Monitoring.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2021,"Weyer C, Prötzl E, Kinateder T, Nowak F, Husemann C, Hautmann H, Kratzer S, Schneider G, Kreuzer M","Intraoperative patient monitoring using the electroencephalogram (EEG) can help to adequately adjust the anesthetic level. Therefore, the processed EEG (pEEG) provides the anesthesiologist with the estimated anesthesia level. The commonly used approaches track the changes from a fast- and a low-amplitude EEG during wakefulness to a slow- and a high-amplitude EEG under general anesthesia. However, besides these changes, another EEG feature, a strong oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz), develops in the frontal EEG. Strong alpha-band activity during general anesthesia seems to reflect an appropriate anesthetic level for certain anesthetics, but the way the common pEEG approaches react to changes in the alpha-band activity is not well explained. Hence, we investigated the impact of an artificial alpha-band modulation on pEEG approaches used in anesthesia research.
We performed our analyses based on 30 seconds of simulated sedation (n = 25) EEG, simulated anesthesia (n = 25) EEG, and EEG episodes from 20 patients extracted from a steady state that showed a clearly identifiable alpha peak in the density spectral array (DSA) and a state entropy (GE Healthcare) around 50, indicative of adequate anesthesia. From these traces, we isolated the alpha activity by band-pass filtering (8-12 Hz) and added this alpha activity to or subtracted it from the signals in a stepwise manner. For each of the original and modified signals, the following pEEG values were calculated: (1) spectral edge frequency (SEF95), (2) beta ratio, (3) spectral entropy (SpEntr), (4) approximate entropy (ApEn), and (5) permutation entropy (PeEn).
The pEEG approaches showed different reactions to the alpha-band modification that depended on the data set and the amplification step. The beta ratio and PeEn decreased with increasing alpha activity for all data sets, indicating a deepening of anesthesia. The other pEEG approaches behaved nonuniformly. SEF95, SpEntr, and ApEn decreased with increasing alpha for the simulated anesthesia data (arousal) but decreased for simulated sedation. For the patient EEG, ApEn indicated an arousal, and SEF95 and SpEntr showed a nonuniform change.
Changes in the alpha-band activity lead to different reactions for different pEEG approaches. Hence, the presence of strong oscillatory alpha activity that reflects an adequate level of anesthesia may be interpreted differently, by an either increasing (arousal) or decreasing (deepening) pEEG value. This could complicate anesthesia navigation and prevent the adjustment to an adequate, alpha-dominant anesthesia level, when titrating by the pEEG values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34543237/

34517477,Depth of anesthesia prediction via EEG signals using convolutional neural network and ensemble empirical mode decomposition.,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2021,"Madanu R, Rahman F, Abbod MF, Fan SZ, Shieh JS","According to a recently conducted survey on surgical complication mortality rate, 47% of such cases are due to anesthetics overdose. This indicates that there is an urgent need to moderate the level of anesthesia. Recently deep learning (DL) methods have played a major role in estimating the depth of Anesthesia (DOA) of patients and has played an essential role in control anesthesia overdose. In this paper, Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been used for the prediction of DOA. EEG signals are very complex signals which may require months of training and advanced signal processing techniques. It is a point of debate whether DL methods are an improvement over the already existing traditional EEG signal processing approaches. One of the DL algorithms is Convolutional neural network (CNN) which is very popular algorithm for object recognition and is widely growing its applications in processing hierarchy in the human visual system. In this paper, various decomposition methods have been used for extracting the features EEG signal. After acquiring the necessary signals values in image format, several CNN models have been deployed for classification of DOA depending upon their Bispectral Index (BIS) and the signal quality index (SQI). The EEG signals were converted into the frequency domain using and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). However, because of the inter mode mixing observed in EMD method; EEMD have been utilized for this study. The developed CNN models were used to predict the DOA based on the EEG spectrum images without the use of handcrafted features which provides intuitive mapping with high efficiency and reliability. The best trained model gives an accuracy of 83.2%. Hence, this provides further scope and research which can be carried out in the domain of visual mapping of DOA using EEG signals and DL methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34517477/
34510633,Electroencephalographic assessment of infant spinal anesthesia: A pilot prospective observational study.,Paediatric anaesthesia,2021,"Whitaker EE, Chao JY, Holmes GL, Legatt AD, Yozawitz EG, Purdon PL, Shinnar S, Williams RK","Spinal anesthesia is utilized as an alternative to general anesthesia in infants for some surgeries. After spinal anesthesia, infants often become less conscious without administration of sedative medications. The aim of this study was to assess electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates after spinal anesthesia in a cohort of infants.
This pilot study included 12 infants who underwent spinal anesthesia. Unprocessed electroencephalography was recorded. The electroencephalogram was interpreted by four neurologists. Processed analyses compared electroencephalogram changes 30 min after spinal anesthesia to baseline.
Following spinal anesthesia, all 12 infants became sedated. Electroencephalography in all 12 demonstrated Stage 2 sleep with the appearance of sleep spindles (12-14 Hz) in the frontal and central leads in 8/12 (67%) of subjects. The median time to onset of sleep spindles was 24.7 interquartile range (21.2, 29.9) min. The duration of sleep spindles was 25.1 interquartile range (5.8, 99.8) min. Voltage attenuation and background slowing were the most common initial changes. Compared to baseline, the electroencephalogram 30 min after spinal anesthesia showed significantly increased absolute delta power (p = 0.02) and gamma power (p < 0.0001); decreases in beta (p = 0.0006) and higher beta (p < 0.0001) were also observed. The Fast Fourier Transform power ratio difference for delta/beta was increased (p = 0.03). Increased coherence was noted in the delta (p = 0.02) and theta (p = 0.04) bandwidths.
Spinal anesthesia in infants is associated with increased electroencephalographic slow wave activity and decreased beta activity compared to the awake state, with appearance of sleep spindles suggestive of normal sleep. The etiology and significance of the observed voltage attenuation and background slowing remains unclear.
The EEG signature of infant spinal anesthesia is distinct from that seen with general anesthesia and is consistent with normal sleep. Further investigation is required to better understand the etiology of these findings. Our preliminary findings contribute to the understanding of the brain effects of spinal anesthesia in early development.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34510633/

The detection of bursts and the calculation of burst/suppression ratio are often used to monitor the level of anesthesia during treatment of status epilepticus. However, manual counting of bursts is a laborious process open to inter-rater variation and motivates a need for automatic detection.
We describe a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that detects bursts in EEG and generates burst-per-minute estimates for the purpose of monitoring sedation level in an intensive care unit (ICU). We validated the algorithm on 29 hours of burst annotated EEG data from 29 patients suffering from status epilepticus and hemorrhage.
We report competitive results in comparison to neural networks learned via supervised learning. The mean absolute error (SD) in bursts per minute was 0.93 (1.38).
We present a novel burst suppression detection algorithm that adapts to each patient individually, reports bursts-per-minute quickly, and does not require manual fine-tuning unlike previous approaches to burst-suppression pattern detection.
Our algorithm for automatic burst suppression quantification can greatly reduce manual oversight in depth of sedation monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34454277/

This article reviews the key features of electroencephalography (EEG) waveforms and their clinical implications in select patient populations and anesthetic techniques. The first patient topic reviewed is the vulnerable brain. This term has emerged as a description of patients who may exhibit increased sensitivity to anesthetics and/or may develop adverse neurocognitive effects following anesthesia. pEEG monitoring of patients who are known to have or are suspected of having vulnerable brains, with focused attention on the suppression ratio, alpha band power, and pEEG indices, may prove useful. Second, pEEG monitoring along with vigilant attention to anesthetic delivery may minimize the risk of intraoperative awareness when administering a total intravenous anesthesia in combination with a neuromuscular blockade. Third, we suggest that processed EEG monitoring may play a role in anesthetic and resuscitative management when adverse changes in blood pressure occur. Fourth, pEEG monitoring can be used to better identify anesthesia requirements and guide anesthetic titration in patients with known or suspected substance use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34425639/

Compared to resting state at baseline, breath holding was characterized by increased EEG power and functional connectivity in the alpha band, along with decreased delta band connectivity. fMRI connectivity was increased within the default mode network (DMN) and visual areas but decreased in pre- and postcentral cortices. While these changes occurred in regions overlapping with cerebral signatures of several meditation practices, they also display some unique features that suggest an altered somatosensory integration.

34407069,A hidden Markov model reliably characterizes ketamine-induced spectral dynamics in macaque local field potentials and human electroencephalograms.,PLoS computational biology,2021,"Garwood IC, Chakravarty S, Donoghue J, Mahnke M, Kahali P, Chamadia S, Akeju O, Miller EK, Brown EN","Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist commonly used to maintain general anesthesia. At anesthetic doses, ketamine causes high power gamma (25-50 Hz) oscillations alternating with slow-delta (0.1-4 Hz) oscillations. These dynamics are readily observed in local field potentials (LFPs) of non-human primates (NHPs) and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from human subjects. However, a detailed statistical analysis of these dynamics has not been reported. We characterize ketamine's neural dynamics using a hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM observations are sequences of spectral power in seven canonical frequency bands between 0 to 50 Hz, where power is averaged within each band and scaled between 0 and 1. We model the observations as realizations of multivariate beta probability distributions that depend on a discrete-valued latent state process whose state transitions obey Markov dynamics. Using an expectation-maximization algorithm, we fit this beta-HMM to LFP recordings from 2 NHPs, and separately, to EEG recordings from 9 human subjects who received anesthetic doses of ketamine. Our beta-HMM framework provides a useful tool for experimental data analysis. Together, the estimated beta-HMM parameters and optimal state trajectory revealed an alternating pattern of states characterized primarily by gamma and slow-delta activities. The mean duration of the gamma activity was 2.2s([1.7,2.8]s) and 1.2s([0.9,1.5]s) for the two NHPs, and 2.5s([1.7,3.6]s) for the human subjects. The mean duration of the slow-delta activity was 1.6s([1.2,2.0]s) and 1.0s([0.8,1.2]s) for the two NHPs, and 1.8s([1.3,2.4]s) for the human subjects. Our characterizations of the alternating gamma slow-delta activities revealed five sub-states that show regular sequential transitions. These quantitative insights can inform the development of rhythm-generating neuronal circuit models that give mechanistic insights into this phenomenon and how ketamine produces altered states of arousal.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34407069/
34397100,Chloral hydrate as a sedating agent for neurodiagnostic procedures in children.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2021,"Fong CY, Lim WK, Li L, Lai NM","This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review published in 2017. Paediatric neurodiagnostic investigations, including brain neuroimaging and electroencephalography (EEG), play an important role in the assessment of neurodevelopmental disorders. The use of an appropriate sedative agent is important to ensure the successful completion of the neurodiagnostic procedures, particularly in children, who are usually unable to remain still throughout the procedure.
To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of chloral hydrate as a sedative agent for non-invasive neurodiagnostic procedures in children.
We searched the following databases on 14 May 2020, with no language restrictions: the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 12 May 2020). CRS Web includes randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the specialised registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Cochrane Epilepsy.
Randomised controlled trials that assessed chloral hydrate agent against other sedative agent(s), non-drug agent(s), or placebo.
Two review authors independently evaluated studies identified by the search for their eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Results were expressed in terms of risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
We included 16 studies with a total of 2922 children. The methodological quality of the included studies was mixed. Blinding of the participants and personnel was not achieved in most of the included studies, and three of the 16 studies were at high risk of bias for selective reporting. Evaluation of the efficacy of the sedative agents was also underpowered, with all the comparisons performed in small studies. Fewer children who received oral chloral hydrate had sedation failure compared with oral promethazine (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.82; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). More children who received oral chloral hydrate had sedation failure after one dose compared to intravenous pentobarbital (RR 4.33, 95% CI 1.35 to 13.89; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), but there was no clear difference after two doses (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.46; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Children with oral chloral hydrate had more sedation failure compared with rectal sodium thiopental (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.96; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence) and music therapy (RR 17.00, 95% CI 2.37 to 122.14; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Sedation failure rates were similar between groups for comparisons with oral dexmedetomidine, oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride, oral midazolam and oral clonidine. Children who received oral chloral hydrate had a shorter time to adequate sedation compared with those who received oral dexmedetomidine (MD -3.86, 95% CI -5.12 to -2.6; 1 study), oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride (MD -7.5, 95% CI -7.85 to -7.15; 1 study), oral promethazine (MD -12.11, 95% CI -18.48 to -5.74; 1 study) (moderate-certainty evidence for three aforementioned outcomes), rectal midazolam (MD -95.70, 95% CI -114.51 to -76.89; 1 study), and oral clonidine (MD -37.48, 95% CI -55.97 to -18.99; 1 study) (low-certainty evidence for two aforementioned outcomes). However, children with oral chloral hydrate took longer to achieve adequate sedation when compared with intravenous pentobarbital (MD 19, 95% CI 16.61 to 21.39; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), intranasal midazolam (MD 12.83, 95% CI 7.22 to 18.44; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), and intranasal dexmedetomidine (MD 2.80, 95% CI 0.77 to 4.83; 1 study, moderate-certainty evidence). Children who received oral chloral hydrate appeared significantly less likely to complete neurodiagnostic procedure with child awakening when compared with rectal sodium thiopental (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). Chloral hydrate was associated with a higher risk of the following adverse events: desaturation versus rectal sodium thiopental (RR 5.00, 95% 0.24 to 102.30; 1 study), unsteadiness versus intranasal dexmedetomidine (MD 10.21, 95% CI 0.58 to 178.52; 1 study), vomiting versus intranasal dexmedetomidine (MD 10.59, 95% CI 0.61 to 185.45; 1 study) (low-certainty evidence for aforementioned three outcomes), and crying during administration of sedation versus intranasal dexmedetomidine (MD 1.39, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.80; 1 study, moderate-certainty evidence). Chloral hydrate was associated with a lower risk of the following: diarrhoea compared with rectal sodium thiopental (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.72; 1 study), lower mean diastolic blood pressure compared with sodium thiopental (MD 7.40, 95% CI 5.11 to 9.69; 1 study), drowsiness compared with oral clonidine (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.64; 1 study), vertigo compared with oral clonidine (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.79; 1 study) (moderate-certainty evidence for aforementioned four outcomes), and bradycardia compared with intranasal dexmedetomidine (MD 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.59; 1 study; high-certainty evidence). No other adverse events were significantly associated with chloral hydrate, although there was an increased risk of combined adverse events overall (RR 7.66, 95% CI 1.78 to 32.91; 1 study; low-certainty evidence).
The certainty of evidence for the comparisons of oral chloral hydrate against several other methods of sedation was variable. Oral chloral hydrate appears to have a lower sedation failure rate when compared with oral promethazine. Sedation failure was similar between groups for other comparisons such as oral dexmedetomidine, oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride, and oral midazolam. Oral chloral hydrate had a higher sedation failure rate when compared with intravenous pentobarbital, rectal sodium thiopental, and music therapy. Chloral hydrate appeared to be associated with higher rates of adverse events than intranasal dexmedetomidine. However, the evidence for the outcomes for oral chloral hydrate versus intravenous pentobarbital, rectal sodium thiopental, intranasal dexmedetomidine, and music therapy was mostly of low certainty, therefore the findings should be interpreted with caution. Further research should determine the effects of oral chloral hydrate on major clinical outcomes such as successful completion of procedures, requirements for an additional sedative agent, and degree of sedation measured using validated scales, which were rarely assessed in the studies included in this review. The safety profile of chloral hydrate should be studied further, especially for major adverse effects such as oxygen desaturation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34397100/

The objective of this study was to describe the early electrophysiological background patterns of neonates and children undergoing ECMO and their association with neurologic outcomes.
This was a retrospective review of neonates and children undergoing ECMO and monitored with aEEG. Amplitude-integrated EEG was summarized as an aEEG background score determined within the first 24 hours of ECMO and divided in 3-hour periods. Screening for electrical seizures was performed throughout the full ECMO duration. Neurologic outcome was defined by the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score at hospital discharge.
Seventy-three patients (median age 79 days [8-660], median weight 4.78 kg [3.24-10.02]) were included in the analysis. Thirty-two patients had a favorable neurologic outcome and 41 had an unfavorable neurologic outcome group at hospital discharge. A 24-hour aEEG background score >17 was associated with an unfavorable outcome with a sensitivity of 44%, a specificity of 97%, a positive predictive value of 95%, and a negative predictive value of 57%. In multivariate analysis, 24-hour aEEG background score was associated with unfavorable outcome (hazard ratio, 6.1; p = 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 2.31-16.24).

They are particularly at risk of developing postoperative neurocognitive disorders (NCD). Earlier studies suggested that processed electroencephalographic (EEG) monitors may reduce the incidence of postoperative NCD. However, none of these studies controlled for intraoperative nociception levels or personalized blood pressure targets. Their results remain unclear if the reduction in the incidence of postoperative NCD relates to avoidance of any electroencephalographic pattern suggesting excessive anesthesia depth.
The objective of this trial is to investigate-in patients ≥ 70 years old undergoing major non-cardiac surgery-the effect of EEG-guided anesthesia on postoperative NCD while controlling for intraoperative nociception, personalized blood pressure targets, and using detailed information provided by the EEG monitor (including burst suppression ratio, density spectral array, and raw EEG waveform).
This prospective, randomized, controlled trial will be conducted in a single Canadian university hospital. Patients ≥ 70 years old undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery will be included in the trial. The administration of sevoflurane will be adjusted to maintain a BIS index value between 40 and 60, to keep a Suppression Ratio (SR) at 0%, to keep a direct EEG display without any suppression time and a spectrogram with most of the EEG wave frequency within the alpha, theta, and delta frequencies in the EEG-guided group. In the control group, sevoflurane will be administered to achieve an age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration of [0.8-1.2]. In both groups, a nociception monitor will guide intraoperative opioid administration, individual blood pressure targets will be used, and cerebral oximetry used to tailor intraoperative hemodynamic management. The primary endpoint will be the incidence of NCD at postoperative day 1, as evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Secondary endpoints will include the incidence of postoperative NCD at different time points and the evaluation of cognitive trajectories up to 90 days after surgery among EEG-guided and control groups.

34352164,Anesthesia for Electroconvulsive Therapy: A Niche Role for Sevoflurane.,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,2021,Andrade C,"Anesthesia for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) usually involves the intravenous (IV) administration of drugs such as methohexital, thiopental, propofol, etomidate, or ketamine. Sevoflurane is an inhalational anesthetic agent that has been available for the past 3 decades. Although many studies have examined sevoflurane in the context of ECT, treatment guidelines make either no mention or only passing mention of its potential use in the ECT procedure. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis identified 12 randomized clinical trials (pooled N = 377) of sevoflurane vs IV anesthetics in patients receiving ECT. The meta-analysis found that sevoflurane was associated with shorter EEG seizure duration than barbiturate, ketamine, or propofol anesthesia; that the postictal suppression index did not differ significantly between sevoflurane and propofol; that sevoflurane increased heart rate more than did the IV anesthetics; that sevoflurane increased mean arterial pressure more than did barbiturates and propofol but less than did ketamine; and that, overall, adverse events did not differ significantly between sevoflurane and IV anesthetics. Other known disadvantages of sevoflurane include the need for additional anesthesia instrumentation, the potentiation of action of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, and the increased complexity of the ECT procedure. These findings and considerations do not encourage the use of sevoflurane for ECT anesthesia. However, there may be a niche role for sevoflurane in patients who are afraid of needlesticks or who are too agitated for an IV line to be set up while they are conscious and in patients who characteristically experience prolonged ECT seizures. Sevoflurane could also be useful in the final trimester of pregnancy because it may inhibit ECT-induced uterine contractions. Importantly, undesired effects of sevoflurane on seizure duration and the hemodynamic response to ECT can be attenuated by discontinuing its administration after induction.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34352164/

With the extraction of only two features, the proposed system can classify the state of consciousness with 94% accuracy for a 1 second EEG epoch, leading to a 100% accurate channel prediction after a 7 s run-time on average.
Through performance evaluation and comparative study confirmed the efficacy of the prototype.
DOA is the measure of consciousness to distinguish whether a patient is suitably anesthetized or not during a surgical procedure. Traditionally the DOA is estimated by checking biophysical responses of a patient during the surgery. However, the physical symptoms can be misleading for a decisive conclusion due to the patient's health condition or as a side-effect of anesthetic drugs. Recently, several neuroscientific research works are correlating the EEG signal with conscious states, which is likely to have less interference with the patient's medical condition. This research presents the first-of-its-kind hardware implemented automatic DOA computation system for mice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34351851/

This comparative case study aims to assess whether electrically induced seizures in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) show sufficient similarities with spontaneous seizures to serve as a human epilepsy model.
We compared six EEG recordings, three ECT-induced seizures and three generalized tonic-clonic seizures, using quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) analyses. EEG recordings during and after ECT sessions (under general anesthesia and muscle paralysis) were collected prospectively, whereas epilepsy data were selected retrospectively. Time-frequency representations, dominant ictal frequencies, and postictal alpha-delta ratios were calculated.
In all EEG recordings, a decrease in dominant ictal frequency was observed, as well as postictal suppression. Postictal alpha-delta ratio indicated the same trend for all: a gradual increase from predominantly delta to alpha frequencies on timescales of hours after the seizure. Postictal spectral representation was similar. Muscle artifacts were absent in ECT-induced seizures and present in spontaneous seizures. Ictal amplitude was higher in epileptic than in ECT-induced seizures. Temporospectral ictal dynamics varied slightly between groups.
We show that ictal and postictal characteristics in ECT and patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures are essentially similar. ECT-induced seizures may be used to investigate aspects of ictal and postictal states in a highly predictable manner and well-controlled environment. This suggests that clinical and electrophysiological observations during ECT may be extrapolated to epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34351710/
34328012,Comparison of the effect of electromyogram activity during emergence on anesthetic depth monitoring between phase lag entropy and bispectral index: a prospective observational study.,Annals of palliative medicine,2022,"Kim TK, Shin SW, Kim HJ, Choi EJ, Park S, Kim SH, Yoo YM, Kim HY","The bispectral index (BIS) is the most widely used algorithm for measuring anesthetic depth. The BIS has been demonstrated as inaccurate when neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) are used. Compared with BIS, phase lag entropy (PLE), which measures the anesthetic depth based on a 4-channel EEG signal, is less affected by EMG. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of EMG activity during emergence on anesthetic depth monitoring between PLE and BIS.
Twenty five consecutive patients with physical status I-II of American Society of Anesthesiologists undergoing general anesthesia (age range, 20-60 years). The anesthesiologist attached the sensors of BIS and PLEM 100 on the patient's forehead. NMB reversal was performed by intravenously injecting sugammadex after confirmation of shallow NMB (TOF count 1-4) under neuromuscular monitoring. The BIS and PLE scores were recorded with neuromuscular monitoring at 1-min intervals for 5 min after administration of sugammadex.
The BIS and BIS-EMG measured at 1 min after sugammadex injection were significantly higher at 1 min [51.650 (46.100, 62.225) (P<0.001); 28.500 (27.800, 31.075) (P=0.003)] than at 0 min. However, there was no between-time point difference in the PLE score and PLE-EMG (P=0.0843, P=0.329).
In general anesthesia using propofol-remifentanil, the BIS at 1 min after sugammadex reversal during emergence appears to be more affected by EMG activity than the PLE score. Therefore, immediately after sugammadex administration (within 1 min), it may be clinically useful to evaluate the consciousness status through the PLE score.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34328012/

We analyzed 40 patients scheduled for elective surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia (n = 20) or propofol anesthesia (n = 20). Anesthesia was adjusted at a bispectral index value of 50-60, and then 0.5 mg/kg of hydroxyzine was administered intravenously. We analyzed frontal electroencephalograms before and after hydroxyzine injection with power spectral and bicoherence analyses, which are suitable for assessing the anesthetic depth induced by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic anesthetics.
Hydroxyzine increased the α bicoherence peaks in both sevoflurane anesthesia (mean difference, 11.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 7.6 to 14.8; P < 0.001) and propofol anesthesia (mean difference, 5.6%; 95% CI, 1.7 to 9.4; P = 0.008).

34252066,A Processed Electroencephalogram-Based Brain Anesthetic Resistance Index Is Associated With Postoperative Delirium in Older Adults: A Dual Center Study.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2022,"Cooter Wright M, Bunning T, Eleswarpu SS, Heflin MT, McDonald SR, Lagoo-Deenadalayan S, Whitson HE, Martinez-Camblor P, Deiner SG, Berger M","Some older adults show exaggerated responses to drugs that act on the brain. The brain's response to anesthetic drugs is often measured clinically by processed electroencephalogram (EEG) indices. Thus, we developed a processed EEG-based measure of the brain's resistance to volatile anesthetics and hypothesized that low scores on it would be associated with postoperative delirium risk.
We defined the Duke Anesthesia Resistance Scale (DARS) as the average bispectral index (BIS) divided by the quantity (2.5 minus the average age-adjusted end-tidal minimum alveolar concentration [aaMAC] inhaled anesthetic fraction). The relationship between DARS and postoperative delirium was analyzed in 139 older surgical patients (age ≥65) from Duke University Medical Center (n = 69) and Mt Sinai Medical Center (n = 70). Delirium was assessed by geriatrician interview at Duke, and by research staff utilizing the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) instrument at Mt Sinai. We examined the relationship between DARS and delirium and used the Youden index to identify an optimal low DARS threshold (for delirium risk), and its associated 95% bootstrap confidence bounds. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the relationship between low DARS and delirium risk.
The relationship between DARS and delirium risk was nonlinear, with higher delirium risk at low DARS scores. A DARS threshold of 28.755 maximized the Youden index for the association between low DARS and delirium, with bootstrap 95% confidence bounds of 26.18 and 29.80. A low DARS (<28.755) was associated with increased delirium risk in multivariable models adjusting for site (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 4.30 [1.89-10.01]; P = .001), or site-plus-patient risk factors (OR [95% CI] = 3.79 [1.63-9.10]; P = .003). These associations with postoperative delirium risk remained significant when using the 95% bootstrap confidence bounds for the low DARS threshold (P < .05 for all). Further, a low DARS (<28.755) was associated with delirium risk after accounting for opioid, midazolam, propofol, phenylephrine, and ketamine dosage as well as site (OR [95% CI] = 4.21 [1.80-10.16]; P = .002). This association between low DARS and postoperative delirium risk after controlling for these other medications remained significant (P < .05) when using either the lower or the upper 95% bootstrap confidence bounds for the low DARS threshold.
These results demonstrate that an intraoperative processed EEG-based measure of lower brain anesthetic resistance (ie, low DARS) is independently associated with increased postoperative delirium risk in older surgical patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34252066/

We analyzed EEG signals recorded from pediatric to adult patients (n = 131), separated into six age groups: <1 year (n = 15), 1-3 years (n = 23), 3-6 years (n = 19), 6-12 years (n = 18), 12-18 years (n = 16), and 18-45 years (n = 40). Age related EEG power and cross frequency coupling analysis (phase amplitude coupling (PAC) and quadratic phase coupling) of data from maintenance of a surgical state of anesthesia (MOSSA) was conducted. Also, for patients of ages less than 6 years, we analyzed the performance of cross frequency coupling derived indices in distinguishing the states of wakefulness, MOSSA, and recovery of consciousness (ROC).
(1) During MOSSA, EEG power substantially increased with age from infancy to 3-6 years then decreased with age in the theta-gamma frequency bands. The infant group (<1 year) had the highest slow oscillation (SO) power among all age groups. (2) The distinct PAC pattern is absent in patients less than 1 year of age both in SO-alpha and delta-alpha frequency band coupling during propofol induced unconsciousness. The modulation index between delta and alpha oscillations in MOSSA increased with age. (3) Wavelet bicoherence derived indices reach their peaks in the 3-6 years group and then decrease with age growth. (4) The Diag_En index (normalized entropy of the diagonal bicoherence entries of the bicoherence matrix) performed the best at distinguishing different states for ages less than 6 years (p<0.05).
The combination of propofol induction and sevoflurane maintenance exhibited age-dependent EEG power spectra, PAC, and bicoherence, likely related to brain development. These observations suggest new rules for infant and child brain state monitoring during general anesthesia are needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34245867/

We performed a follow-up study to evaluate the reasons for the discordance. Forty-five patients were monitored intraoperatively with processed EEG. A computer algorithm was used to convert the SedLine® (machine)-generated burst suppression ratio into a raw duration of burst suppression. The reference standard was a precise off-line measurement by two neurologists. We measured other potential variables that may affect machine accuracy such as age, surgery position, and EEG artifacts. Overall, the median duration of bust suppression for all study subjects was 15.4 min (Inter-quartile Range [IQR] = 1.0-20.1) for the machine vs. 16.1 min (IQR = 0.3-19.7) for the neurologists' assessment; the 95% limits of agreement fall within - 4.86 to 5.04 s for individual 30-s epochs. EEG artifacts did not affect the concordance between the two methods. For patients in prone surgical position, the machine estimates had significantly lower overall sensitivity (0.86 vs. 0.97; p = 0.038) and significantly wider limits of agreement ([- 4.24, 3.82] seconds vs. [- 1.36, 1.13] seconds, p = 0.001) than patients in supine position. Machine readings for younger patients (age < 65 years) had higher sensitivity (0.96 vs 0.92; p = 0.021) and specificity (0.99 vs 0.88; p = 0.007) for older patients. The duration of burst suppression estimated by the machine generally had good agreement compared with neurologists' estimation using a more precise off-line measurement. Factors that affected the concordance included patient age and position during surgery, but not EEG artifacts.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34245405/

In a clinical trial testing anaesthesia titration to avoid EEG suppression, the intervention did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium, but was associated with reduced 30-day mortality. The present study evaluated whether the EEG-guided anaesthesia intervention was also associated with reduced 1-yr mortality.
This manuscript reports 1 yr follow-up of subjects from a single-centre RCT, including a post hoc secondary outcome (1-yr mortality) in addition to pre-specified secondary outcomes. The trial included subjects aged 60 yr or older undergoing surgery with general anaesthesia between January 2015 and May 2018. Patients were randomised to receive EEG-guided anaesthesia or usual care. The previously reported primary outcome was postoperative delirium. The outcome of the current study was all-cause 1-yr mortality.
Of the 1232 subjects enrolled, 614 subjects were randomised to EEG-guided anaesthesia and 618 subjects to usual care. One-year mortality was 57/591 (9.6%) in the guided group and 62/601 (10.3%) in the usual-care group. No significant difference in mortality was observed (adjusted absolute risk difference, -0.7%; 99.5% confidence interval, -5.8% to 4.3%; P=0.68).
An EEG-guided anaesthesia intervention aiming to decrease duration of EEG suppression during surgery did not significantly decrease 1-yr mortality. These findings, in the context of other studies, do not provide supportive evidence for EEG-guided anaesthesia to prevent intermediate term postoperative death.

We aimed to determine whether adding EEG features to predictive models including clinical variables and examination signs increased the accuracy of short-term neurobehavioral outcome prediction.
This was a prospective, observational, single-center study of consecutive infants and children resuscitated from CA. Standardized EEG scoring was performed by an electroencephalographer for the initial EEG timepoint after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and each 12-h segment from the time of ROSC up to 48 h. EEG Background Category was scored as: (1) normal; (2) slow-disorganized; (3) discontinuous or burst-suppression; or (4) attenuated-featureless. The primary outcome was neurobehavioral outcome at discharge from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. To develop the final predictive model, we compared areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) from models with varying combinations of Demographic/Arrest Variables, Examination Signs, and EEG Features.
We evaluated 89 infants and children. Initial EEG Background Category was normal in 9 subjects (10%), slow-disorganized in 44 (49%), discontinuous or burst suppression in 22 (25%), and attenuated-featureless in 14 (16%). The final model included Demographic/Arrest Variables (witnessed status, doses of epinephrine, initial lactate after ROSC) and EEG Background Category which achieved AUROC of 0.9 for unfavorable neurobehavioral outcome and 0.83 for mortality.

Because these utilise EEG data, attempts have been made to investigate their use in diagnosing and monitoring seizures. This is important as formal EEG monitoring can be hard to obtain in many critical care environments. We undertook a scoping review of the evidence for using processed EEG (pEEG) from depth of anaesthesia monitors for this indication.
Medline, Psych INFO, and Embase were searched for peer-reviewed journals until 20 March 2021. Data and conclusions taken from the study of pEEG in both critical care and peri-operative settings have been included in a qualitative synthesis about the current evidence for the use of pEEG in the detection and monitoring of seizures.
Searches yielded 8 observational studies, 1 randomised trial and 15 case reports in which the use of pEEG in critical care and peri-operative medicine was described. Most concerned the Bispectral Index (BIS) device. The majority of observational studies reported the use of BIS for optimisation of burst suppression in patients with refractory status-epilepticus (RSE), or in the comparison of pEEG data with conventional EEG during epileptic activity. Multiple case reports describe the application of pEEG in the presence of disorders of consciousness as a tool for detection of non-convulsive status-epilepticus, finding variable trends in the pEEG output.

Neonates with acute symptomatic seizures born 7/2015-3/2018 were prospectively enrolled at nine Neonatal Seizure Registry sites. One-hour EEG was recorded at age three months. Post-neonatal epilepsy and functional development (Warner Initial Developmental Evaluation of Adaptive and Functional Skills - WIDEA-FS) were assessed. Cox regression was used to assess epilepsy-free survival.
Among 282 infants, 37 (13%) had post-neonatal epilepsy by 24-months [median age of onset 7-months (IQR 3-14)]. Among those with post-neonatal epilepsy, 13/37 (35%) had infantile spasms and 12/37 (32%) had drug-resistant epilepsy. Most children with post-neonatal epilepsy had abnormal neurodevelopment at 24-months (WIDEA-FS >2SD below normal population mean for 81% of children with epilepsy vs 27% without epilepsy, RR 7.9, 95% CI 3.6-17.3). Infants with severely abnormal neonatal EEG background patterns were more likely to develop epilepsy than those with mild/moderate abnormalities (HR 3.7, 95% CI 1.9-5.9). Neonatal EEG with ≥3 days of seizures also predicted hazard of epilepsy (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-5.9). In an adjusted model, days of neonatal EEG-confirmed seizures (HR 1.4 per day, 95% CI 1.2-1.6) and abnormal discharge examination (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.9-7.8) were independently associated with time to epilepsy onset. Abnormal (vs. normal) three-month EEG was not associated with epilepsy.
In this multicenter study, only 13% of infants with acute symptomatic neonatal seizures developed post-neonatal epilepsy by age 24-months. However, there was a high risk of severe neurodevelopmental impairment and drug-resistant seizures among children with post-neonatal epilepsy. Days of EEG-confirmed neonatal seizures was a potentially modifiable epilepsy risk factor. An EEG at three months was not clinically useful for predicting epilepsy.

We hypothesized that the rate of administration is a major contributor affecting the construction of a useful effect-site model: yielding different plasmatic concentrations, loss of consciousness may occur by different mechanisms more complex than the pharmacological effect-site.
ASA III patients were randomized in two groups: rapid induction (RI) received TCI of propofol effect-site (CeCALC) 5.4 μg/mL (modified Marsh model), and slow induction (SI) propofol infusion of 10 mg/kg/hour. A neurologist, blinded to induction method, performed neurological assessments using the FOUR score until the loss of consciousness (LOC).

In this prospective study, we investigated the accuracy of continuously measured early SWA for prediction of the outcome in comatose cardiac arrest (CA) survivors.
We recorded EEG with a disposable self-adhesive frontal electrode and wireless device continuously starting from ICU admission until 48 h from return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in comatose CA survivors sedated with propofol. We determined SWA by offline calculation of C-Trend® Index describing SWA as a score ranging from 0 to 100. The functional outcome was defined based on Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) at 6 months after the CA to either good (CPC 1-2) or poor (CPC 3-5).
Outcome at six months was good in 67 of the 93 patients. During the first 12 h after ROSC, the median C-Trend Index value was 38.8 (interquartile range 28.0-56.1) in patients with good outcome and 6.49 (3.01-18.2) in those with poor outcome showing significant difference (p < 0.001) at every hour between the groups. The index values of the first 12 h predicted poor outcome with an area under curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.61-0.99).

34099242,Brain activity complexity has a nonlinear relation to the level of propofol sedation.,British journal of anaesthesia,2021,"Boncompte G, Medel V, Cortínez LI, Ossandón T","Brain activity complexity is a promising correlate of states of consciousness. Previous studies have shown higher complexity for awake compared with deep anaesthesia states. However, little attention has been paid to complexity in intermediate states of sedation.
We analysed the Lempel-Ziv complexity of EEG signals from subjects undergoing moderate propofol sedation, from an open access database, and related it to behavioural performance as a continuous marker of the level of sedation and to plasma propofol concentrations. We explored its relation to spectral properties, to propofol susceptibility, and its topographical distribution.
Subjects who retained behavioural performance despite propofol sedation showed increased brain activity complexity compared with baseline (M=13.9%, 95% confidence interval=7.5-20.3). This was not the case for subjects who lost behavioural performance. The increase was most prominent in frontal electrodes, and correlated with behavioural performance and propofol susceptibility. This effect was positively correlated with high-frequency activity. However, abolishing specific frequency ranges (e.g. alpha or gamma) did not reduce the propofol-induced increase in Lempel-Ziv complexity.
Brain activity complexity can increase in response to propofol, particularly during low-dose sedation. Propofol-mediated Lempel-Ziv complexity increase was independent of frequency-specific spectral power manipulations, and most prominent in frontal areas. Taken together, these results advance our understanding of brain activity complexity and anaesthetics. They do not support models of consciousness that propose a direct relation between brain activity complexity and states of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34099242/

Processed electroencephalogram (EEG) depth-of-anesthesia monitoring relies to a significant extent on frequency domain analysis of the frontal EEG, and there is evidence that the spectral features observed under anesthesia vary significantly between anesthetic agents. The spectral features of the EEG during xenon anesthesia for a surgical procedure have not previously been described.
Twenty-four participants scheduled for general anesthesia for lithotripsy were randomized to receive either xenon anesthesia or sevoflurane anesthesia. Frontal EEG recordings were obtained from each participant via the Brain Anesthesia Response Monitor (BARM). Twenty-two EEG recordings were suitable for analysis: 11 in participants who received sevoflurane and 11 in participants who received xenon. Spectrograms for the duration of the anesthetic episode were produced for each participant. Group-level spectral analysis was calculated for two 30-second EEG epochs: one recorded at awake baseline and the other during maintenance anesthesia. A linear mixed-effects model was utilized to compare the changes in 5 frequency bands from baseline to maintenance between the 2 groups.
The spectrograms of sevoflurane participants illustrate an increase in frontal delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), and alpha (8-13 Hz) band power during maintenance anesthesia. In contrast, spectrograms of the xenon participants did not illustrate an increase in alpha power. The results of the linear mixed-effects model indicate that both agents were associated with a significant increase in delta power from baseline to maintenance. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of this increase observed between the agents. In contrast, sevoflurane anesthesia was associated with significantly greater absolute power in the theta, alpha, and beta (13-30 Hz) bands when compared to xenon. In terms of relative power, xenon was associated with a significant increase in delta power compared to sevoflurane, while sevoflurane was associated with greater increases in relative theta, alpha, and beta power.
Both xenon anesthesia and sevoflurane anesthesia were associated with significant increases in delta power. Sevoflurane anesthesia was also associated with increases in theta, alpha, and beta power, while xenon anesthesia was associated with greater consolidation of power in the delta band. Xenon anesthesia and sevoflurane anesthesia are associated with distinct spectral features. These findings suggest that appropriate depth-of-anesthesia monitoring may require the development of agent-specific spectral measures of unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34081045/

We included term neonates with acute symptomatic seizures enrolled in the Neonatal Seizure Registry (NSR), a prospective, multicenter cohort of neonates with seizures. We compared 2 cEEG approaches: (1) screening cEEG, initiated for indications of encephalopathy or paralysis without suspected clinical seizures; and (2) confirmatory cEEG, initiated for the indication of clinical events suspicious for seizures, either alone or in addition to other indications. The primary outcome was successful response to initial seizure treatment, defined as seizures resolved without recurrence within 30 minutes after initial loading dose of antiseizure medicine. Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed the association between cEEG approach and successful seizure treatment.
Among 514 neonates included, 161 (31%) had screening cEEG and 353 (69%) had confirmatory cEEG. Neonates with screening cEEG had a higher proportion of successful initial seizure treatment than neonates with confirmatory cEEG (39% vs 18%;
These findings provide evidence from a large, contemporary cohort of neonates that a screening cEEG approach may improve odds of successful treatment of acute seizures.
This study provides Class III evidence that for neonates a screening cEEG approach, compared to a confirmatory EEG approach, increases the probability of successful treatment of acute seizures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34078719/

We hypothesised that postoperative delirium mediates a clinically significant (≥1%) percentage of the effect of frailty on mortality in older orthopaedic trauma patients.
This was a single-centre, retrospective observational study including 558 adults 65 yr and older, who presented with an extremity fracture requiring hospitalisation without initial ICU admission. We used causal statistical inference methods to estimate the relationships between frailty, postoperative delirium, and mortality.
In the cohort, 180-day mortality rate was 6.5% (36/558). Frail and prefrail patients comprised 23% and 39%, respectively, of the study cohort. Frailty was associated with increased 180 day mortality from 1.4% to 12.2% (11% difference; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-13.6), which translated statistically into an 88.7% (79.9-94.3%) direct effect and an 11.3% (5.7-20.1%) postoperative delirium mediated effect. Prefrailty was also associated with increased 180 day mortality from 1.4% to 4.4% (2.9% difference; 2.4-3.4), which was translated into a 92.5% (83.8-99.9%) direct effect and a 7.5% (0.1-16.2%) postoperative delirium mediated effect.
Frailty is associated with increased postoperative mortality, and delirium might mediate a clinically significant, but small percentage of this effect.

The pharmacokinetics of propofol are however different in children compared to adults. The value of exhaled propofol measurements in pediatric anesthesia has not yet been investigated. Breathing system filters and breathing circuits can also interfere with the measurements. In this study, we investigated correlations between exhaled propofol (exP) concentrations and the Narkotrend Index (NI) as well as calculated propofol plasma concentrations.
A multi-capillary-column (MCC) combined with ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) was used to determine exP. Optimal positioning of breathing system filters (near-patient or patient-distant) and sample line (proximal or distal to filter) were investigated. Measurements were taken during induction (I), maintenance (M) and emergence (E) of children under total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). Correlations between ExP concentrations and NI and predicted plasma propofol concentrations (using pediatric pharmacokinetic models Kataria and Paedfusor) were assessed using Pearson correlation and regression analysis.
Near-patient positioning of breathing system filters led to continuously rising exP values when exP was measured proximal to the filters, and lower concentrations when exP was measured distal to the filters. The breathing system filters were therefore subsequently attached between the breathing system tubes and the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the anesthetic machine. ExP concentrations significantly correlated with NI and propofol concentrations predicted by pharmacokinetic models during induction and maintenance of anesthesia. During emergence, exP significantly correlated with predicted propofol concentrations, but not with NI.
In this study, we demonstrated that exP correlates with calculated propofol concentrations and NI during induction and maintenance in pediatric patients. However, the correlations are highly variable and there are substantial obstacles: Without patient proximal placement of filters, the breathing circuit tubing must be changed after each patient, and furthermore, during ventilation, a considerable additional loss of heat and moisture can occur. Adhesion of propofol to plastic parts (endotracheal tube, breathing circle) may especially be problematic during emergence.

37 adults and 17 children were monitored with simultaneous fNIRS and EEG, during the complete general anesthesia process. The coupling of fNIRS signals with neuronal signals (EEG) was calculated. Measures of complexity (sample entropy) and phase difference were also quantified from fNIRS signals to identify unique fNIRS based biomarkers of general anesthesia.
A significant decrease in the complexity and power of fNIRS signals characterize the anesthesia maintenance phase. Furthermore, responses to anesthesia vary between adults and children in terms of neurovascular coupling and frontal EEG alpha power.

These include postoperative cognitive dysfunction or delirium as well as cerebrovascular accidents. During surgery, it is essential to ensure an adequate degree of sedation and analgesia, and at the same time, to provide hemodynamic and respiratory stability in order to minimize neurological complications. In this context, the role of neuromonitoring in the operating room is gaining interest, even in the non-neurolosurgical population. The use of multimodal neuromonitoring can potentially reduce the occurrence of adverse effects during and after surgery, and optimize the administration of anesthetic drugs. In addition to the traditional focus on monitoring hemodynamic and respiratory systems during general anesthesia, the ability to constantly monitor the activity and maintenance of brain homeostasis, creating evidence-based protocols, should also become part of the standard of care: in this challenge, neuromonitoring comes to our aid. In this review, we aim to describe the role of the main types of noninvasive neuromonitoring such as those based on electroencephalography (EEG) waves (EEG, Entropy module, Bispectral Index, Narcotrend Monitor), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) based on noninvasive measurement of cerebral regional oxygenation, and Transcranial Doppler used in the perioperative settings in non-neurosurgical intervention.

The development of postoperative delirium (POD) is associated with increased hospital stay lengths, morbidity, the need for home care, and mortality. Studies have appeared in the last decade that evaluate the use of noninvasive monitoring to prevent its development. The evaluation of the depth of anesthesia with processed EEG allows to avoid awareness and burst suppression events. The cessation of brain activity is associated with the development of delirium. Another noninvasive monitoring technique is NIRS for cerebral tissue hypoxia detection by measuring regional oxygen saturation. The reduction of this parameter does not seem to be associated with the development of POD but with postoperative cognitive dysfunction.

The goal of this study was to compare an envelope-based (i.e. Amplitude Envelope Correlation, AEC) and a phase-based (i.e. weighted Phase Lag Index, wPLI) measure of FC in their classification of states of consciousness. Nine healthy participants underwent a three-hour experimental anesthetic protocol with propofol induction and isoflurane maintenance, in which five minutes of 128-channel electroencephalography were recorded before, during, and after anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, at the following time points: Baseline; light sedation with propofol (Light Sedation); deep unconsciousness following three hours of surgical levels of anesthesia with isoflurane (Unconscious); five minutes prior to the recovery of consciousness (Pre-ROC); and three hours following the recovery of consciousness (Recovery). Support vector machine classification was applied to the source-localized EEG in the alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency band in order to investigate the ability of AEC and wPLI (separately and together) to discriminate i) the four states from Baseline; ii) Unconscious (""deep"" unconsciousness) vs. Pre-ROC (""light"" unconsciousness); and iii) responsiveness (Baseline, Light Sedation, Recovery) vs. unresponsiveness (Unconscious, Pre-ROC). AEC and wPLI yielded different patterns of global connectivity across states of consciousness, with AEC showing the strongest network connectivity during the Unconscious epoch, and wPLI showing the strongest connectivity during full consciousness (i.e., Baseline and Recovery). Both measures also demonstrated differential predictive contributions across participants and used different brain regions for classification. AEC showed higher classification accuracy overall, particularly for distinguishing anesthetic-induced unconsciousness from Baseline (83.7 ± 0.8%). AEC also showed stronger classification accuracy than wPLI when distinguishing Unconscious from Pre-ROC (i.e., ""deep"" from ""light"" unconsciousness) (AEC: 66.3 ± 1.2%; wPLI: 56.2 ± 1.3%), and when distinguishing between responsiveness and unresponsiveness (AEC: 76.0 ± 1.3%; wPLI: 63.6 ± 1.8%). Classification accuracy was not improved compared to AEC when both AEC and wPLI were combined.

As age is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD) the incidence of POD will increase concordantly. One approach to reduce the risk of POD would be to avoid excessively high doses of anaesthetics by using neuromonitoring to guide anaesthesia titration. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of patient's age on various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based anaesthesia indices.
We conducted an analysis of previously published data by replaying single electrode EEG episodes of maintenance of general anaesthesia from 180 patients (18-90 years; ASA I-IV) into the five different commercially available monitoring systems and evaluated their indices. We included the State/Response Entropy, Narcotrend, qCON/qNOX, bispectral index (BIS), and Treaton MGA-06. For a non-commercial comparison, we extracted the spectral edge frequency (SEF) from the BIS. To evaluate the influence of the age we generated linear regression models. We also assessed the correlation between the various indices.
During anaesthetic maintenance the values of the SEF, State/Response Entropy, qCON/qNOX and BIS all significantly increased (0.05 Hz/0.19-0.26 index points per year) with the patient's age (p < 0.001); whereas the Narcotrend did not change significantly with age (0.06 index points per year; p = 0.28). The index values of the Treaton device significantly decreased with age (-0.09 index points per year; p < 0.001). These findings were independent of the administered dose of anaesthetics.
Almost all current neuromonitoring devices are influenced by age, with the potential to result in inappropriately high dosage of anaesthetics. Therefore, anaesthesiologists should be aware of this phenomenon, and the next generation of monitors should correct for these changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33975095/

To address this question, we conducted a multicenter study of 60 healthy humans, half of whom received general anesthesia for 3 hr and half of whom served as awake controls. We administered a battery of neurocognitive tests and recorded electroencephalography to assess cortical dynamics. We hypothesized that recovery of consciousness and cognition is an extended process, with differential recovery of cognitive functions that would commence with return of responsiveness and end with return of executive function, mediated by prefrontal cortex. We found that, just prior to the recovery of consciousness, frontal-parietal dynamics returned to baseline. Consistent with our hypothesis, cognitive reconstitution after anesthesia evolved over time. Contrary to our hypothesis, executive function returned first. Early engagement of prefrontal cortex in recovery of consciousness and cognition is consistent with global neuronal workspace theory.
Anesthesia is a state of reversable, controlled unconsciousness. It has enabled countless medical procedures. But it also serves as a tool for scientists to study how the brain regains consciousness after disruptions such as sleep, coma or medical procedures requiring general anesthesia. It is still unclear how exactly the brain regains consciousness, and less so, why some patients do not recover normally after general anesthesia or fail to recover from brain injury. To find out more, Mashour et al. studied the patterns of reemerging consciousness and cognitive function in 30 healthy adults who underwent general anesthesia for three hours. While the volunteers were under anesthesia, their brain activity was measured with an EEG; and their sleep-wake activity was measured before and after the experiment. Each participant took part in a series of cognitive tests designed to measure the reaction speed, memory and other functions before receiving anesthesia, right after the return of consciousness, and then every 30 minutes thereafter. Thirty healthy volunteers who did not have anesthesia also completed the scans and tests as a comparison group. The experiments showed that certain normal EEG patterns resumed just before a person wakes up from anesthesia. The return of thinking abilities was an extended, multistep process, but volunteers recovered their cognitive abilities to nearly the same level as the volunteers within three hours of being deeply anesthetized. Mashour et al. also unexpectedly found that abstract problem-solving resumes early in the process, while other functions such as reaction time and attention took longer to recover. This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. Sleep leaves individuals vulnerable. Quick evaluation and decision-making skills would be key to respond to a threat upon waking. The experiments confirm that the front of the brain, which handles thinking and decision-making, was especially active around the time of recovery. This suggests that therapies targeting this part of the brain may help people who experience loss of consciousness after a brain injury or have difficulties waking up after anesthesia. Moreover, disorders of cognition, such as delirium, in the days following surgery may be caused by factors other than the lingering effects of anesthetic drugs on the brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33970101/

In this work, we investigated whether EEG based brain decoding could be used for detecting connected consciousness in the absence of behavioral responses during propofol infusion. A total of 14 subjects participated in our experiment. Subjects were asked to discriminate two types of auditory stimuli with a finger press during an ultraslow propofol infusion. We trained an EEG based brain decoding model using data collected in the awakened state using the same auditory stimuli and tested the model on data collected during the propofol infusion. The model provided a correct classification rate (CCR) of [Formula: see text]% when subjects were able to respond to the stimuli during the propofol infusion. The CCR dropped to [Formula: see text]% when subjects ceased responding and further decreased to [Formula: see text]% when we increased the propofol concentration by another 0.2 [Formula: see text]g/ml.

Drug- and patient-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness have been identified previously. We applied machine learning approaches to construct classification models for real-time tracking of unconscious state during anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. We used cross-validation to select and train the best performing models using 33,159 2s segments of EEG data recorded from 7 healthy volunteers who received increasing infusions of propofol while responding to stimuli to directly assess unconsciousness. Cross-validated models of unconsciousness performed very well when tested on 13,929 2s EEG segments from 3 left-out volunteers collected under the same conditions (median volunteer AUCs 0.99-0.99). Models showed strong generalization when tested on a cohort of 27 surgical patients receiving solely propofol collected in a separate clinical dataset under different circumstances and using different hardware (median patient AUCs 0.95-0.98), with model predictions corresponding with actions taken by the anesthesiologist during the cases. Performance was also strong for 17 patients receiving sevoflurane (alone or in addition to propofol) (median AUCs 0.88-0.92). These results indicate that EEG spectral features can predict unconsciousness, even when tested on a different anesthetic that acts with a similar neural mechanism.

We want to propose a novel idea of a cause of these adverse results occurring following epileptic seizures and anesthesia. Previously we have put forward the idea that epileptic seizures termination is caused by the function of the glymphatic system in the brain. A new measurement shows that this system can be much faster than what was estimated before. Moreover, the method enabling this speeding was actually measured in brains of epilepsy subjects. So, the main objection to our model is relegated. As a possible consequence of the glymphatic process, there can be an excess cleaning of the brain's interstitial fluid. We discuss possible adverse results of this process. This over-cleaning (that can, to a lower extent, occur also during anesthesia) which results post-ictally from the previous overexpression of fluid materials by the neurons during their seizure operation, can reduce ingredients essential for regular neuronal functioning, thereby leading to function reduction and EEG suppression which last until those materials are replenished. We argue that this ingredients' scarcity is the cause of post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES), of post-ictal immobility (PI) and possibly of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy Patients (SUDEP). Similarly, such cleaning can lead to morbidity and even mortality problems following anesthesia. If our assumption is correct, this understanding of the process of the problems' origin can lead to a method to remedy them by judicial supplement of the lost materials.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33873149/

Important molecular targets of general anesthetics have been identified, but the neural circuits underlying the discrete end points of general anesthesia remain incompletely understood. General anesthesia and natural sleep share the common feature of reversible unconsciousness, and recent developments in neuroscience have enabled elegant studies that investigate the brain nuclei and neural circuits underlying this important end point. A common approach to measure cortical activity across the brain is electroencephalogram (EEG), which can reflect local neuronal activity as well as connectivity among brain regions. The EEG oscillations observed during general anesthesia depend greatly on the anesthetic agent as well as dosing, and only some resemble those observed during sleep. For example, the EEG oscillations during dexmedetomidine sedation are similar to those of stage 2 nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, but high doses of propofol and ether anesthetics produce burst suppression, a pattern that is never observed during natural sleep. Sleep is primarily driven by withdrawal of subcortical excitation to the cortex, but anesthetics can directly act at both subcortical and cortical targets. While some anesthetics appear to activate specific sleep-active regions to induce unconsciousness, not all sleep-active regions play a significant role in anesthesia. Anesthetics also inhibit cortical neurons, and it is likely that each class of anesthetic drugs produces a distinct combination of subcortical and cortical effects that lead to unconsciousness. Conversely, arousal circuits that promote wakefulness are involved in anesthetic emergence and activating them can induce emergence and accelerate recovery of consciousness. Modern neuroscience techniques that enable the manipulation of specific neural circuits have led to new insights into the neural circuitry underlying general anesthesia and sleep.

This is a potentially limiting characterization, as transient oscillatory bursts like spindles are easily obscured in the time domain by higher amplitude activity at other frequencies or by noise. It is therefore highly plausible that many relevant events are missed by current approaches based on traditionally defined spindles. Given their oscillatory structure, we reexamine spindle activity from first principles, using time-frequency activity in comparison to scored spindles.
Using multitaper spectral analysis, we observe clear time-frequency peaks in the sigma (10-16 Hz) range (TFσ peaks). While nearly every scored spindle coincides with a TFσ peak, numerous similar TFσ peaks remain undetected. We therefore perform statistical analyses of spindles and TFσ peaks using manual and automated detection methods, comparing event cooccurrence, morphological similarities, and night-to-night consistency across multiple datasets.
On average, TFσ peaks have more than three times the rate of spindles (mean rate: 9.8 vs. 3.1 events/minute). Moreover, spindles subsample the most prominent TFσ peaks with otherwise identical spectral morphology. We further demonstrate that detected TFσ peaks have stronger night-to-night rate stability (ρ = 0.98) than spindles (ρ = 0.67), while covarying with spindle rates across subjects (ρ = 0.72).
These results provide compelling evidence that traditionally defined spindles constitute a subset of a more generalized class of EEG events. TFσ peaks are therefore a more complete representation of the underlying phenomenon, providing a more consistent and robust basis for future experiments and analyses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33857311/

There is limited evidence of MAC's reliability in controlling sedation depth in this setting. We hypothesized that sedation depth, measured by the electroencephalography (EEG)-derived Narcotrend-Index (burst-suppression N_Index 0-awake N_Index 100), might drift downward over time despite constant MAC values.
This prospective single-centre randomized clinical study was conducted at a University Hospital Surgical Intensive Care Unit and included consecutive, postoperative ICU patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to receive uninterrupted inhalational sedation with isoflurane, sevoflurane, or desflurane. The end-expiratory concentration of the anaesthetics and the EEG-derived index were measured continuously in time-stamped pairs. Sedation depth was also monitored using Richmond-Agitation-Sedation-Scale (RASS). The paired t-test and linear models (bootstrapped or multilevel) have been employed to analyze MAC, N_Index and RASS across the three groups.
Thirty patients were recruited (female/male: 10/20, age 64 ± 11, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 30 ± 10). In the first 24 h, 21.208 pairs of data points (N_Index and MAC) were recorded. The median MAC of 0.58 ± 0.06 remained stable over the sedation time in all three groups. The t-test indicated in the isoflurane and sevoflurane groups a significant drop in RASS and EEG-derived N_Index in the first versus last two sedation hours. We applied a multilevel linear model on the entire longitudinal data, nested per patient, which produced the formula N_Index = 43 - 0.7·h (R
Maintaining constant MAC does not guarantee stable sedation depth. Thus, the patients necessitate frequent clinical assessments or, when unfeasible, continuous EEG monitoring. The differences across different volatile anaesthetics regarding their time-dependent negative drift requires further exploration.

Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the electroencephalogram dynamics of etomidate-induced loss of consciousness (LOC) in order to understand the neurological mechanism of etomidate-induced LOC.
This study is a prospective observational study. Etomidate-induced anesthesia was performed on eligible patients undergoing elective surgery. We analyzed EEG data from 20 patients who received etomidate for the induction of general anesthesia. We used power spectra and coherence methods to process and analyze the EEG data. Our study was based on 4-channel EEG recordings.
Compared with the baseline (awake period), etomidate induced an increase in power in delta, theta, alpha and beta waves during LOC. Compared with the awake period, the delta-wave (1-4 Hz), alpha-wave(8-13 Hz), and theta-wave(4-8 Hz) coherence increased significantly during LOC, while the slow-wave (< 1 Hz) coherence decreased. However, the delta wave (1.0-4.0 Hz) during etomidate-induced LOC was more coherent than during the awake period (1.86-3.17 Hz, two-group test for coherence, p < 0.001).
The neural circuit mechanism of etomidate-induced LOC is closely related to the induction of oscillation in delta, theta, alpha and beta waves and the enhancement of delta-wave coherence.

However, the clinical assessment of anesthetic depth may not always agree with available processed EEG indices. To concurrently compare the performance of BIS and SedLine monitors, we present a data collection system using shared individual generic sensors connected to a custom-built passive interface box.
This prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized study will enroll 100 adult American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-III patients presenting for elective procedures requiring general anesthesia. BIS and SedLine electrodes will be placed preoperatively according to manufacturer recommendations and their respective indices tracked throughout anesthesia induction, maintenance and emergence. The concordance between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthesia depth will be analyzed with chi-square and kappa statistic.
Prior studies comparing brain function monitoring devices have applied both sensors on the forehead of study subjects simultaneously. With limited space and common sensor locations between devices, it is not possible to place both commercial sensor arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations, thus compromising the validity of these comparisons. This trial utilizes a custom interface allowing signals from sensors to be shared between BIS and SedLine monitors to provide an accurate comparison. Our results will also characterize the degree of agreement between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthetic depth as determined by the anesthesiologists' interpretations of acute changes in blood pressure and heart rate as well as the administration, or change to the continuous delivery, of medications at these timepoints. Patient factors (such as burst suppression state or low power EEG conditions from aging brain), surgical conditions (such as use of electrocautery), artifacts (such as electromyography), and anesthesia medications and doses (such as end-tidal concentration of volatile anesthetic or hypnotic infusion dose) that lead to lack of agreement will be explored as well.

Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health were searched until 9 April 2020 for studies using melatonin and reporting one of the prespecified outcomes of this review. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility, risk of bias and extracted the data. Studies with a similar study design, comparator and procedure were pooled using the fixed-effect model.
25 studies (clinical trials=3, observational studies=9, descriptive studies=13) were included. Melatonin was used for electroencephalogram (EEG) (n=12), brainstem evoked response audiometry (n=8) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n=5). No significant differences were noted on meta-analysis of EEG studies comparing melatonin with sleep deprivation (SD) (relative risk (RR) 1.06 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.12)), melatonin with chloral hydrate (RR 0.97 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.05)) and melatonin alone with melatonin and SD combined (RR 1.03 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.10)) for successful procedure completion. However, significantly higher sedation failure was noted in melatonin alone compared with melatonin and SD combined (RR 1.55 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.33)) for EEG. Additionally, meta-analysis showed lower sleep latency for melatonin compared with SD (mean difference -10.21 (95% CI -11.53 to -8.89) for EEG. No major adverse events were reported with melatonin.

There are no current treatment guidelines for SIRPIDs. This report is of a 73-year-old woman with respiratory failure and without any detectable gross brain lesions. She had developed SIRPIDs, which were diagnosed through CEEG monitoring. She responded well to valproate, carbamazepine, and clonazepam. CASE REPORT A 73-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a chest infection. After 3 days, this infection was complicated by respiratory failure and coma, for which she was intubated. After that, recurrent brief episodes of abnormal head and right upper limb jerky movements with right gaze deviation occurred. Nurses noticed that these episodes occurred exclusively upon physical interaction with the patient, and lasted up to 3 minutes. No focal findings were noted on neurological examination. The brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed no acute brain insult. CEEG revealed SIRPIDs, which abated with midazolam boluses, followed by infusion at 15 mg/hour. Later, they were controlled by valproate, carbamazepine, and clonazepam in succession, guided by CEEG data. CONCLUSIONS This report shows the importance of CEEG monitoring to diagnose SIRPIDs and monitor treatment response. It also suggests that SIRPIDs can occur even in the absence of gross brain pathology. Although there are no current treatment guidelines for SIRPIDs, the use of valproate, carbamazepine, and clonazepam can help control them, as evidenced in this case.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33784269/

Functional outcome was measured by Glasgow outcome score (GOS) at the time of hospital discharge and was divided into: good i.e. GOS ≥ 3 and bad outcome i.e. GOS < 3. The predictors of outcome were determined using appropriate statistical tests by univariate and multivariate analysis, p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Of the 384 patients with status epilepticus (SE) identified during the study, 28 (8%) were diagnosed as SRSE and were included in the final analysis. Acute symptomatic SE comprising 15 (53.6%) patients was the most common etiology of SRSE. Thirteen patients (three patients with viral encephalitis and 10 patients with clinically possible autoimmune encephalitis) had New Onset Refractory Status Epilepticus (NORSE) like clinical presentation.12 patients (42.9%) had good outcome and 16 patients (57.1%) had bad outcome. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that independent predictors of poor outcome were: duration of ICU stay (p < 0.001); EEG findings such as non-convulsive SE in coma (0.032), spontaneous burst suppression (0.001) and postictal diffuse attenuation (<0.001); delay in starting anesthesia (0.002); and delay in starting immunotherapy in NORSE due to autoimmune encephalitis (0.002).
We could determine independent therapeutic and electrophysiological prognostic factors for SRSE. Early initiation of treatment and stringent management of these factors especially in an younger age-group, aided by continuous EEG monitoring and a thorough etiological work-up can result in good outcomes in more than one-third of cases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33775578/

However, precise and real-time estimation of DOA index for painful surgical operations is challenging due to problems such as postoperative complications and accidental awareness. To tackle these problems, we propose a new combinatorial deep learning structure involving convolutional neural networks (inspired by the inception module), bidirectional long short-term memory, and an attention layer. The proposed model uses the EEG signal to continuously predicts the bispectral index (BIS). It is trained over a large dataset, mostly from those under general anesthesia with few cases receiving sedation/analgesia and spinal anesthesia. Despite the imbalance distribution of BIS values in different levels of anesthesia, our proposed structure achieves convincing root mean square error of 5.59 ± 1.04 and mean absolute error of 4.3 ± 0.87, as well as improvement in area under the curve of 15% on average, which surpasses state-of-the-art DOA estimation methods.

We collected and analysed overnight polysomnography data using the Somté PSG device and assessed for delirium twice a day until postoperative day 3 using the long version of the confusion assessment method and a structured chart review. We also assessed subjective sleep quality using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. The delirium median preoperative hospital stay of 9 [Q1, Q3: 7, 11] days was similar to the non-delirium preoperative hospital stay of 7 [4, 9] days (p = .154). The incidence of delirium was 45.5% (10/22) in the entire study cohort and 50% (8/16) in the final cohort with clean polysomnography data. The preoperative delirium median total sleep time of 323.8 [Q1, Q3: 280.3, 382.1] min was longer than the non-delirium median total sleep time of 254.3 [210.9, 278.1] min (p = .046).

The core algorithmic software (the BIS Engine) can be retrieved from the motherboard of the A-2000 monitor in binary form through forensic disassembly using debugging interfaces left in place by the original designers, opening the possibility of executing the BIS algorithms on contemporary computers through emulation. Three steps were required for emulation. Firstly, the monitor input stage monitor was disassembled to determine how EEG signals can be compatibly presented to the Engine. Secondly, the Digital Signal Processor on which the Engine executes was recreated in software. Thirdly, the Engine code was patched, allowing execution separated from monitor hardware. Code performance under noise load was evaluated. EEG signals and BIS variables were obtained from a 13-year-old child in normal physiological sleep using a modern BIS monitor. BIS values in sleeping children exhibit a wide dynamic range, including values nominally associated with clinical anesthesia, providing a risk-free technique to obtain empirical EEG data that broadly exercise the algorithms. Emulation demonstrated a correlation coefficient of R = 0.943, consistent with correlations between official Engine iterations. Additive white noise in the EEG caused a progressive lifting and flattening of BIS values. Emulation replicates BIS Engine behavior, allowing calculation upon existing EEG datasets or signals from other, potentially remote or wireless, devices.

We implemented and compared three state-of-the-art machine learning methods for ES prediction: (1) random forest; (2) Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO); and (3) Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT). We developed a ranking algorithm based on the relative importance of each variable derived from the machine learning methods.

Compared to the stepwise selection-based approach in logistic regression, the top variables selected by our ranking algorithm were more informative as models utilizing the top variables achieved better prediction performance evaluated by prediction accuracy, AUROC and F1 score. Adding additional variables did not improve and sometimes worsened model performance.
The ranking algorithm was helpful in deriving a parsimonious model for ES prediction with optimal performance.

Impacts of electrode montages and bandwidth are also reported. The perspective of this work is to improve the detection of intraoperative awareness during general anesthesia.
Various architectures of EEGNet were investigated to optimize MI detection. They have been compared to the state-of-the-art classifiers in Brain-Computer Interfaces (based on Riemannian geometry, linear discriminant analysis), and other deep learning architectures (deep convolution network, shallow convolutional network). EEG data were measured from 22 participants performing motor imagery with and without median nerve stimulation.
The proposed architecture of EEGNet reaches the best classification accuracy (83.2%) and false-positive rate (FPR 19.0%) for a setup with only six electrodes over the motor cortex and frontal lobe and for an extended 4-38 Hz EEG frequency range while the subject is being stimulated via a median nerve. Configurations with a larger number of electrodes result in higher accuracy (94.5%) and FPR (6.1%) for 128 electrodes (and respectively 88.0% and 12.9% for 13 electrodes).
The present work demonstrates that using an extended EEG frequency band and a modified EEGNet deep neural network increases the accuracy of MI detection when used with as few as 6 electrodes which include frontal channels.

Multiple DoA monitors based on electroencephalograms (EEGs) have been widely used for DoA monitoring; however, these monitors may be inaccurate under certain conditions. In this work, we hypothesize that heart rate variability (HRV)-derived features based on a deep neural network can distinguish different anaesthesia states, providing a secondary tool for DoA assessment.
A novel method of distinguishing different anaesthesia states was developed based on four HRV-derived features in the time and frequency domain combined with a deep neural network. Four features were extracted from an electrocardiogram, including the HRV high-frequency power, low-frequency power, high-to-low-frequency power ratio, and sample entropy. Next, these features were used as inputs for the deep neural network, which utilized the expert assessment of consciousness level as the reference output. Finally, the deep neural network was compared with the logistic regression, support vector machine, and decision tree models. The datasets of 23 anaesthesia patients were used to assess the proposed method.
The accuracies of the four models, in distinguishing the anaesthesia states, were 86.2% (logistic regression), 87.5% (support vector machine), 87.2% (decision tree), and 90.1% (deep neural network). The accuracy of deep neural network was higher than those of the logistic regression (p < 0.05), support vector machine (p < 0.05), and decision tree (p < 0.05) approaches. Our method outperformed the logistic regression, support vector machine, and decision tree methods.
The incorporation of four HRV-derived features in the time and frequency domain and a deep neural network could accurately distinguish between different anaesthesia states; however, this study is a pilot feasibility study.

PGES is associated with an increased risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy, as well as treatment efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We investigated the impact of anesthetic on PGES expression and temporal characteristics.
We recorded postictal EEG in 50 ECT sessions in 11 patients with treatment resistant depression (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02761330). For each participant, repeated sessions included either ketamine or etomidate general anesthesia during ECT. An automated algorithm was employed to detect PGES within 5 minutes after seizure termination.
PGES was detected in 31/50 recordings, with intermittent epochs recurring up to five minutes after seizure termination. PGES total duration was greater following ketamine than etomidate anesthesia (p = 0.04). PGES expression declined loglinearly as a function of time (r = -0.89, p < 10

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is used in adult and, to a lesser extent, pediatric cardiac procedures as a neuromonitoring method. The present study was performed to assess outcomes following DHCA with EEG monitoring in the pediatric population.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Institute of Science Index, and Embase databases were searched from inception for relevant articles. A fixed- or random-effects model, as appropriate, was used.

Nineteen articles with 1,267 pediatric patients ≤18 years were included. The event rate of clinical and EEG seizures among patients who underwent DHCA was 12.9% and 14.9%, respectively. Mortality was found to have a 6.3% prevalence. A longer duration of DHCA was associated with a higher risk of EEG seizure and neurologic abnormalities. In addition, seizures were associated with increased neurologic abnormalities and neurodevelopmental delay.

The averaged TI was 106.6±20.2 (mean±SD) seconds. There was significant improvement of overall CGI-S score after ECT treatment (3.3±1.0) vs pre-ECT treatment (5.0±0.8, p<0.001) while there was no significant change of MoCA score over the course of 6 ECT (p>0.05). The anaesthesia-ECT TI had no association with post-ECT CGI-S while longer anaesthesia-ECT TI was associated with poorer post-ECT MoCA scores [adjusted β, -0.056; 95% CI (-0.099, -0.013), p=0.011] and better EEG quality score [adjusted β (0.001), 95% CI (0, 0.002), p=0.011].
Longer TI between anaesthesia and ECT stimulus administration resulted in higher seizure quality, suggesting more effective stimulation. This was associated with more cognitive impairment but not higher efficacy. The assessment of outcomes after only 6 ECT limited the ability to fully explore associations between the TI and clinical outcomes. This was a retrospective analysis of clinical data from a real-world treatment setting.

Such capability can greatly increase seizure freedom rate in surgically treated drug resistant epilepsy cases. Furthermore, ESI might be important in intracranial record planning.
We report the case of a 15 years old boy suffering from drug resistant epilepsy with a previous history of DNET removal. The patient suffered from heterogeneous seizure semiology characterized by anesthesia and loss of tone in the left arm, twisting of the jaw to the left and dysarthria accompanied by daze; lightheadedness sometimes associated with headache and dizziness and at a relatively short time distance negative myoclonus involving the left hand. Clinical evidence poorly match scalp and video EEG monitoring thus requiring hdEEG recording followed by SEEG to define surgical target. Surgery was also guided by ECoG and obtained seizure freedom.
ESI offers an excellent estimate of EZ, being hdEEG and intracranial recordings especially important in defining it. We analyzed our results together with the data from the literature showing how in children hdEEG might be even more crucial than in adults due to the heterogeneity in seizures phenomenology. The complexity of each case and the technical difficulties in dealing with children, stress even more the importance of a noninvasive tool for diagnosis.

We aimed at establishing a nonhuman primate model for the evaluation of benzodiazepine EEG pharmacology.
Four adult male rhesus monkeys were prepared with fully implantable telemetry devices that monitored activity, peripheral body temperature, and contained two EEG (central and occipital), one electromyography (EMG), and one electrooculography channel. We investigated daytime alprazolam-induced changes in EEG spectral power, sleep-wake states, EMG activity, locomotor activity, and body temperature. Alprazolam (0.01-1.8 mg/kg, i.m.) or vehicle was administered acutely, and telemetry recording was conducted for 1 h.
Daytime alprazolam dose-dependently increased central EEG power (including beta activity), increased occipital EEG delta power, and decreased occipital EEG alpha, theta, and sigma power. There was an ~8-fold difference in the potency of alprazolam to increase central EEG beta vs. occipital EEG delta activity (based on relative EEG power). The highest dose, which increased both central EEG beta and occipital EEG delta relative power, induced sedative effects (increased time spent in N1 and N2 sleep stages) and decreased peripheral body temperature and locomotor activity.

In the alpha (8-13 Hz) band, 5-min epochs of EEG were extracted for: Baseline; Induction; Unconscious; 30-, 10- and 5-min pre-recovery of responsiveness; 30- and 180-min post-recovery of responsiveness. We constructed a functional brain network using the weighted and directed phase lag index, on which we calculated the frequency and topology of 3-node motifs. Three motifs (motifs 1, 2 and 5) were significantly present across participants and epochs, when compared to random networks (p < 0.05). The topology of motifs 1 and 5 changed significantly between responsive and unresponsive epochs (p-values < 0.01; Kendall's W = 0.664 (motif 1) and 0.529 (motif 5)). Motif 1 was constituted of long-range chain-like connections, while motif 5 was constituted of short-range, loop-like connections.

However, there are still many controversies in terms of reproducibility and reliability when selecting different parameters or datatypes. In this study, five electrode configurations (91, 64, 32, 19, and 8 channels) were used to measure the reliability of microstate analysis at different electrode densities during propofol-induced sedation. First, the microstate topography and parameters at five different electrode densities were compared in the baseline (BS) condition and the moderate sedation (MD) condition, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) were introduced to quantify the consistency of the microstate parameters. Second, statistical analysis and classification between BS and MD were performed to determine whether the microstate differences between different conditions remained stable at different electrode densities, and ICC was also calculated between the different conditions to measure the consistency of the results in a single condition. The results showed that in both the BS or MD condition, respectively, there were few significant differences in the microstate parameters among the 91-, 64-, and 32-channel configurations, with most of the differences observed between the 19- or 8-channel configurations and the other configurations. The ICC and CV data also showed that the consistency among the 91-, 64-, and 32-channel configurations was better than that among all five electrode configurations after including the 19- and 8-channel configurations. Furthermore, the significant differences between the conditions in the 91-channel configuration remained stable at the 64- and 32-channel resolutions, but disappeared at the 19- and 8-channel resolutions. In addition, the classification and ICC results showed that the microstate analysis became unreliable with fewer than 20 electrodes. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that microstate analysis of different brain states is more reliable with higher electrode densities; the use of a small number of channels is not recommended.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33592245/

EEG allows reliable and real-time assessment of early changes in background patterns, development of seizures and epileptiform activity, as well as testing for background reactivity to stimuli despite use of sedation or targeted temperature management. Delayed emergence of consciousness post-cardiac arrest is common, therefore longitudinal monitoring of EEG allows the detection of trends indicative of neurological improvement before coma recovery can be observed clinically.

Here, we computationally evaluate the relative contributions of three RSNs - the default mode network (DMN), the salience network (SAL), and the central executive network (CEN) - to consciousness and its loss during propofol anaesthesia. Specifically, we use dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of 10 min of high-density EEG recordings (N = 10, 4 males) obtained during behavioural responsiveness, unconsciousness and post-anaesthetic recovery to characterise differences in effective connectivity within frontal areas, the posterior 'hot zone', frontoparietal connections, and between-RSN connections. We estimate - for the first time - a large DCM model (LAR) of resting EEG, combining the three RSNs into a rich club of interconnectivity. Consistent with the hot zone theory, our findings demonstrate reductions in inter-RSN connectivity in the parietal cortex. Within the DMN itself, the strongest reductions are in feed-forward frontoparietal and parietal connections at the precuneus node. Within the SAL and CEN, loss of consciousness generates small increases in bidirectional connectivity. Using novel DCM leave-one-out cross-validation, we show that the most consistent out-of-sample predictions of the state of consciousness come from a key set of frontoparietal connections. This finding also generalises to unseen data collected during post-anaesthetic recovery. Our findings provide new, computational evidence for the importance of the posterior hot zone in explaining the loss of consciousness, highlighting also the distinct role of frontoparietal connectivity in underpinning conscious responsiveness, and consequently, suggest a dissociation between the mechanisms most prominently associated with explaining the contrast between conscious awareness and unconsciousness, and those maintaining consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33577934/

When access to EEG is limited, physicians may empirically treat, risking unnecessary sedation and intubation, or not treat, increasing risk of refractory seizures. Either may prolong hospital length of stay (LOS). The current study aimed to examine the effect of a new EEG system (Ceribell Rapid Response EEG, Rapid-EEG) on hospital costs by enabling easy access to EEG and expedited seizure diagnosis and treatment.
We built a two-armed decision-analytic cost-benefit model comparing Rapid-EEG with clinical suspicion alone for NCSE. Diagnostic parameters were informed by a multicenter clinical trial (DECIDE, NCT03534258), while LOS and cost parameters were from public US inpatient data, published literature, and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services fee schedules. We calculated reference case estimates from mean values, while uncertainty was assessed using 95% prediction intervals (PI) generated by probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and ANCOVA sum of squares. All costs were indexed to 2019 US$.
Each use case of Rapid-EEG saved $3,971 to $17,290 as it led to reduction in the hospital LOS by 1.2 days (6.1 vs. 7.4 days) and ICU LOS by 0.4 days (1.5 vs. 1.9 days). Using PSA, Rapid-EEG saving was $5,633 per use case (95% PI: $($4,649 to $6,617), as it led to diminished hospital LOS by 1.1 days (95% PI: 0.9-1.4 days) and reduced ICU LOS by 0.5 days (95% PI: 0.4-0.6 days). Cost-savings were demonstrated in 75% of replications. Sixty-four percent of variance in total costs was attributable to LOS for persons incorrectly diagnosed with seizures.

Besides its use in evaluating hypnotic states, neurophysiologic reactions to noxious stimulation can also be observed in the EEG. Recognising and understanding these responses could help optimise intraoperative analgesic management. This review describes three types of changes in the EEG induced by noxious stimulation when the patient is under general anaesthesia: (1) beta arousal, (2) (paradoxical) delta arousal, and (3) alpha dropout. Beta arousal is an increase in EEG power in the beta-frequency band (12-25 Hz) in response to noxious stimulation, especially at lower doses of anaesthesia drugs in the absence of opioids. It is usually indicative of a cortical depolarisation and increased cortical activity. At higher concentrations of anaesthetic drug, and with insufficient opioids, delta arousal (increased power in the delta band [0.5-4 Hz]) and alpha dropout (decreased alpha power [8-12 Hz]) are associated with noxious stimuli. The mechanisms of delta arousal are not well understood, but the midbrain reticular formation seems to play a role. Alpha dropout may indicate a return of thalamocortical communication, from an idling mode to an operational mode. Each of these EEG changes reflect an incomplete modulation of pain signals and can be mitigated by administration of opioid or the use of regional anaesthesia techniques. Future studies should evaluate whether titrating analgesic drugs in response to these EEG signals reduces postoperative pain and influences other postoperative outcomes, including the potential development of chronic pain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33461725/

Typically to produce balanced anesthesia in the clinical setting, several anesthetic and adjuvant agents are combined. This creates challenges for the clinical use of intraoperative EEG monitoring, because computational approaches are mostly limited to spectral analyses and different agents and combinations produce different EEG responses. Thus, testing of many combinations of agents is needed to generate accurate, protocol independent analyses. Additionally, most studies to develop new computational approaches take place in young, healthy adults and electrophysiological responses to anesthetics vary widely at the extremes of age, due to physiological brain differences. Below, we discuss the challenges associated with EEG biomarker identification for anesthetic depth based on the diversity of molecular targets.

Reducing prognostic uncertainty will lead to more appropriate care decisions and ensure provision of limited rehabilitation resources to those most likely to benefit. Bedside markers of covert residual cognition, including speech comprehension, may reduce this uncertainty.
We recruited 28 patients with acute traumatic brain injury who were 2 to 7 days sedation-free and failed to obey commands. Patients heard streams of isochronous monosyllabic words that built meaningful phrases and sentences while their brain activity via electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. In healthy individuals, EEG activity only synchronizes with the rhythm of phrases and sentences when listeners consciously comprehend the speech. This approach therefore provides a measure of residual speech comprehension in unresponsive patients.
Seventeen and 16 patients were available for assessment with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) at 3 months and 6 months, respectively. Outcome significantly correlated with the strength of patients' acute cortical tracking of phrases and sentences (r > 0.6, p < 0.007), quantified by inter-trial phase coherence. Linear regressions revealed that the strength of this comprehension response (beta = 0.603, p = 0.006) significantly improved the accuracy of prognoses relative to clinical characteristics alone (eg, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS], computed tomography [CT] grade).
A simple, passive, auditory EEG protocol improves prognostic accuracy in a critical period of clinical decision making. Unlike other approaches to probing covert cognition for prognostication, this approach is entirely passive and therefore less susceptible to cognitive deficits, increasing the number of patients who may benefit.

This method effectively differentiates between patients with and without delirium, and predict long-term mortality. In the present study, we aimed to apply our bispectral EEG (BSEEG) method, which can detect patients with delirium, to a mouse model of delirium with systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) injection. We recorded EEG after LPS injection using wildtype early adulthood mice (2~3-month-old) and aged mice (18-19-month-old). Animal EEG recordings were converted for power spectral density to calculate BSEEG score using the similar BSEEG algorithm previously developed for our human study. The BSEEG score was relatively stable and slightly high during the day. Alternatively, the BSEEG score was erratic and low in average during the night. LPS injection increased the BSEEG score dose-dependently and diminished the diurnal changes. The mean BSEEG score increased much more in the aged mice group as dosage increased.

33358824,Progress in modelling of brain dynamics during anaesthesia and the role of sleep-wake circuitry.,Biochemical pharmacology,2021,"Nguyen G, Postnova S","General anaesthesia is used widely in surgery and during interventional medical procedures, but little is known about the exact neural mechanisms for how unconsciousness arises from administering an anaesthetic drug. Computational modelling of brain dynamics has already provided valuable insights into the neural circuitry involved in generating this state. Current theories for the origin of electroencephalographic (EEG) features in brain activity under GABAergic anaesthetic drugs have been proposed through modelling results. While much attention has been paid to describing alpha and delta oscillations, burst suppression, paradoxical excitation and the possibility of hysteresis during transitions to and from unconscious state, these models have focused only on the role of the thalamocortical system. Recent empirical findings suggest that anaesthetic drugs may act directly on the neural circuitry regulating sleep and wake states and circadian rhythms in the hypothalamus. Coupled with the common behavioural features found in physiological sleep and general anaesthesia, this evidence serves as a foundation for the 'shared circuits hypothesis' which proposes that anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness arises predominantly through modulation of the hypothalamic sleep-wake switch. This paper reviews the key findings from computational models describing brain states during the administration of anaesthetic drugs, with a focus on those enhancing GABAergic inhibition given their widespread use in practice and that almost all models of anaesthesia have focused on these drugs. We draw physiological and behavioural links between brain states during sleep and anaesthesia, and aim to highlight the importance of computational modelling in advancing our understanding of anaesthesia by considering sleep and circadian mechanisms in generating unconsciousness in future work.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33358824/

There is a need for robust sedation level monitoring systems to accurately track sedation levels across all drug classes, sex and age groups. Forty-four quantitative features estimated from a pooled dataset of 204 EEG recordings from 66 healthy adult volunteers who received either propofol, dexmedetomidine, or sevoflurane (all with and without remifentanil) were used in a machine learning based automated system to estimate the depth of sedation. Model training and evaluation were performed using leave-one-out cross validation methodology. We trained four machine learning models to predict sedation levels and evaluated the influence of remifentanil, age, and sex on the prediction performance. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the prediction model. The ensemble tree with bagging outperformed other machine learning models and predicted sedation levels with an AUC = 0.88 (0.81-0.90). There were significant differences in the prediction probability of the automated systems when trained and tested across different age groups and sex. The performance of the EEG based sedation level prediction system is drug, sex, and age specific. Nonlinear machine-learning models using quantitative EEG features can accurately predict sedation levels. The results obtained in this study may provide a useful reference for developing next generation EEG based sedation level prediction systems using advanced machine learning algorithms.

Recently, a new wireless EEG headset (CerebAir®,Nihon-Kohden) is available. It has 8 electrodes, and its positioning seems to be easier than conventional systems. Aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this device for cEEG monitoring, if positioned by ICU physician.
Neurological patients were divided in two groups according with the admission to Neuro-ICU (Study-group:20 patients) or General-ICU (Control-group:20 patients). In Study group, cEEG was recorded by CerebAir® assembled by an ICU physician, while in Control group a simplified 8-electrodes-EEG recording positioned by an EEG technician was performed.
Time for electrodes applying was shorter in Study-group than in Control-group: 6.2 ± 1.1' vs 10.4 ± 2.3'; p < 0.0001. Thirty five interventions were necessary to correct artifacts in Study-group and 11 in Control-group. EEG abnormalities with or without epileptic meaning were respectively 7(35%) and 7(35%) in Study-group, and 5(25%) and 9(45%) in Control-group;p > 0.05. In Study-group, cEEG was interrupted for risk of skin lesions in 4 cases after 52 ± 4 h. cEEG was obtained without EEG technician in all cases in Study-group; quality of EEG was similar.
Although several limitations should be considered, this simplified EEG system could be feasible even if EEG technician was not present. It was faster to position if compared with standard techniques, and can be used for continuous EEG monitoring. It could be very useful as part of diagnostic process in an emergency setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33287711/

Hence, it is speculated that acupuncture may have a sedative effect. However, existing studies employed acupuncture in combination with anesthetics, which makes determine acupuncture's role in producing sedation difficult. In this work, we investigated the sedative effect of acupuncture by using transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TAES) at bilateral Zusanli (ST36), Shenmen (HT7) and Sanyinjiao (SP6). Using a cross-over design, 2 separate sessions, that are, the resting and TAES sessions, were conducted for each subject. The sedative effect was quantified by using the bispectral index (BIS). The difference in brain activities between resting and TAES sessions was investigated by analyzing the simultaneously recorded EEG signals. Our results showed that a statistically significant difference in BIS values existed between resting and TAES sessions, which suggested that TAES alone was capable of inducing observable sedation. Using power spectrum analysis, we showed that TAES-induced sedation was accompanied by a reduction in alpha band power and an increment in delta band power. Permutation entropy was lower during the TAES session, which suggested that TAES reduced the complexity of the EEG signal. Moreover, a significant reduction in the global strength of brain functional connections was observed during TAES. These findings suggest that TAES alone can induce observable sedative effects, and this sedation effect is accompanied by changes in brain activities that have shown to be correlated with consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33256427/

This study quantifies night-to-night variability of BAI and establishes probability thresholds for inferring underlying brain pathology based on a patient's BAI.
86 patients with multiple nights of consecutive EEG recordings were selected from Epilepsy Monitoring Unit patients whose EEGs reported as within normal limits. While EEGs with epileptiform activity were excluded, the majority of patients included in the study had a diagnosis of chronic epilepsy. BAI was calculated for each 12-hour segment of patient data using a previously established algorithm, and the night-to-night variability in BAI was measured.
The within-patient night-to-night standard deviation in BAI was 7.5 years. Estimates of BAI derived by averaging over 2, 3, and 4 nights had standard deviations of 4.7, 3.7, and 3.0 years, respectively.
Averaging BAI over n nights reduces night-to-night variability of BAI by a factor of n, rendering BAI a more suitable biomarker of brain health at the individual level. A brain age risk lookup table of results provides thresholds above which a patient has a high probability of excess BAI.
With increasing ease of EEG acquisition, including wearable technology, BAI has the potential to track brain health and detect deviations from normal physiologic function. The measure of night-to-night variability and how this is reduced by averaging across multiple nights provides a basis for using BAI in patients' homes to identify patients who should undergo further investigation or monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33248430/

The current analysis aimed to identify whether bispectral index (BIS) variations reliably reflect the actual depth of general anesthesia during presence of different types of epileptiform patterns (EPs) in EEGs during induction of general anesthesia.
Sixty patients receiving either VIGA with sevoflurane using increasing concentrations (group VIMA) or vital capacity (group VCRII) technique or intravenous single dose of propofol (group PROP) were included. Monitoring included facial electromyography (fEMG), fraction of inspired sevoflurane (FiAA), fraction of expired sevoflurane (FeAA), minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane, BIS, standard EEG, and hemodynamic parameters.
In the PROP group no EPs were observed. During different stages of VIGA with sevoflurane in the VIMA and VCRII groups, presence of polyspikes and rhythmic polyspikes in patients' EEGs resulted in artifactual BIS values indicating a false awareness/wakefulness from anesthesia, despite no concomitant change of FiAA, FeAA, and MAC of sevoflurane. Periodic epileptiform discharges did not result in aberrant BIS values.
Our results suggest that raw EEG correlate it with values of BIS, FiAA, FeAA, and MAC of sevoflurane during VIGA. It seems that because artifactual BIS values indicating false awareness/wakefulness as a result of presence of polyspikes and rhythmic polyspikes in patients' EEGs may be misleading to an anesthesiologist, leading to unintentional administration of toxic concentration of sevoflurane in ventilation gas.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33241952/

Clinical studies have demonstrated cortical and spinal motor neuron hyperexcitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation and threshold tracking nerve conduction studies, respectively, although metrics of excitability have not been used as pharmacodynamic biomarkers in multi-site clinical trials.
To ascertain whether ezogabine decreases cortical and spinal motor neuron excitability in ALS.
This double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 randomized clinical trial sought consent from eligible participants from November 3, 2015, to November 9, 2017, and was conducted at 12 US sites within the Northeast ALS Consortium. Participants were randomized in equal numbers to a higher or lower dose of ezogabine or to an identical matched placebo, and they completed in-person visits at screening, baseline, week 6, and week 8 for clinical assessment and neurophysiological measurements.
Participants were randomized to receive 600 mg/d or 900 mg/d of ezogabine or a matched placebo for 10 weeks.
The primary outcome was change in short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI; SICI-1 was used in analysis to reflect stronger inhibition from an increase in amplitude) from pretreatment mean at screening and baseline to the full-dose treatment mean at weeks 6 and 8. The secondary outcomes included levels of cortical motor neuron excitability (including resting motor threshold) measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation and spinal motor neuron excitability (including strength-duration time constant) measured by threshold tracking nerve conduction studies.
A total of 65 participants were randomized to placebo (23), 600 mg/d of ezogabine (23), and 900 mg/d of ezogabine (19 participants); 45 were men (69.2%) and the mean (SD) age was 58.3 (8.8) years. The SICI-1 increased by 53% (mean ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.12-2.09; P = .009) in the 900-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group. The SICI-1 did not change in the 600-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group (mean ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.87-1.52; P = .31). The resting motor threshold increased in the 600-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group (mean ratio, 4.61; 95% CI, 0.21-9.01; P = .04) but not in the 900-mg/d ezogabine group vs placebo group (mean ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, -2.64 to 6.54; P = .40).

Ezogabine decreased cortical and spinal motor neuron excitability in participants with ALS, suggesting that such neurophysiological metrics may be used as pharmacodynamic biomarkers in multisite clinical trials.

This gives a unique opportunity to observe the functions and physiological activity of one hemisphere while anaesthetising the other, allowing direct comparisons between brain states and hemispheres that are not possible in any other setting.
To test whether potential measures of consciousness would be affected by selective anaesthesia of one hemisphere, and reliably distinguish the states of the anesthetised and non-anesthetised hemispheres.
We analysed EEG data from 7 patients undergoing Wada-tests in preparation for neurosurgery and computed several measures reported to correlate with the state of consciousness: power spectral density, functional connectivity, and measures of signal diversity. These measures were compared between conditions (normal rest vs. unilateral anaesthesia) and hemispheres (injected vs. non-injected), and used with a support vector machine to classify the state and site of injection objectively from individual patient's recordings.
Although brain function, assessed behaviourally, appeared to be substantially altered only on the injected side, we found large bilateral changes in power spectral density for all frequency bands tested, and functional connectivity changed significantly both between and within both hemispheres. Surprisingly, we found no statistically significant differences in the measures of signal diversity between hemispheres or states, for the group of 7 patients, although 4 of the individual patients showed a significant decrease in signal diversity on the injected side. Nevertheless, including signal diversity measures improved the classification results, indicating that these measures carry at least some non-redundant information about the condition and injection site. We propose that several of these results may be explained by conduction of activity, via the corpus callosum, from the injected to the contralateral hemisphere and vice versa, without substantially affecting the function of the receiving hemisphere, thus reflecting what we call ""cross-state unreceptiveness"".",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33221442/

We employed a combination of measures from EEG resting-state data: auto-correlation window (ACW), power spectral density (PSD), and power-law exponent (PLE). Prolonged neural timescales accompanied by a shift towards slower frequencies were observed in the conditions with sensory deficits, but not in conditions with motor deficits.

In most patients, the EEG changes somewhat predictably in response to propofol and volatile agents, so a frontal EEG channel can guide avoidance of insufficient and excessive administration of general anesthesia. Persistent alpha-spindles (around 10 Hz) phase-amplitude coupled with slow delta waves (around 1 Hz) are commonly seen during an ""appropriate hypnotic state of general anesthesia"". Such patterns can be appreciated from the EEG waveform or from the spectrogram (a colour-coded display of how the power in the various EEG frequencies changes with time). Nevertheless, there are exceptions to this. For example, administration of ketamine and nitrous oxide is generally not associated with the aforementioned alpha-spindle coupled with delta wave pattern. Also, some patients, including older adults and those with neurodegenerative disorders, are less predisposed to generate a strong electroencephalographic ""alpha-spindle"" pattern during general anesthesia. There might also be some rare instances when the frontal EEG shows a pattern suggestive of general anesthesia, while the patient has some awareness and is able to follow simple commands, albeit this is typically without obvious distress or memory formation. Thus, the frontal EEG alone, as currently analyzed, is an imperfect but clinically useful mirror, and more scientific insights will be needed before we can claim to have a reliable readout of brain ""function"" during general anesthesia.
RéSUMé: L’électroencéphalogramme (EEG) procure une image fiable de l’état électrique du cerveau, de telle sorte qu’il peut nous rassurer que les agents anesthésiques atteignent bien le cerveau du patient et ont l’effet désiré. Chez la plupart des patients, le tracé de l’EEG change de façon relativement prévisible en réponse au propofol et aux agents volatils; ainsi, une analyse d’EEG frontal peut prévenir l’administration insuffisante ou excessive d’anesthésique générale. Pendant « un état hypnotique adéquat de l’anesthésie générale », on remarquera fréquemment une phase-amplitude de fuseaux alpha (alpha-spindles phase amplitude) (d’environ 10 Hz) couplée à des ondes lentes delta (d’environ 1 Hz). De tels tracés peuvent être observés à partir de l’EEG ou sur un spectrogramme (un affichage par code couleur de la façon dont la puissance dans les diverses fréquences d’EEG se modifie au fil du temps). Toutefois, il existe des exceptions. Par exemple, l’administration de kétamine et de protoxyde d’azote n’est généralement pas associée au tracé de fréquence alpha couplé à l’onde delta susmentionné. En outre, certains patients, notamment des personnes plus âgées et les personnes souffrant de maladies neurodégénératives, sont moins prédisposés à générer un fort tracé électroencéphalographique de ‘fréquence alpha’ pendant une anesthésie générale. Dans de rares cas, le tracé de l’EEG frontal pourrait évoquer une anesthésie générale alors que le patient est encore quelque peu conscient et capable de suivre des ordres simples, mais ces situations surviennent habituellement sans détresse ni rétention de mémoire évidente. Par conséquent, l’EEG frontal seul tel qu’il est analysé à l’heure actuelle est un miroir clinique utile mais imparfait, et des recherches scientifiques seront nécessaires avant de pouvoir affirmer que nous disposons d’une mesure fiable de la « fonction » cérébrale pendant l’anesthésie générale.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33190217/

Early treatment of IS provides the best chance of seizure remission and favorable developmental outcome. We aimed to develop a prediction rule to accurately predict which neonates with acute symptomatic seizures will develop IS.
We used data from the Neonatal Seizure Registry, a prospective, multicenter cohort of infants with acute symptomatic neonatal seizures born from July 2015 to March 2018. Neonates with acute symptomatic seizures who received clinical electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were younger than 2 years of age at the time of enrollment were included. We evaluated the association of neonatal EEG, MRI, and clinical factors with subsequent IS using bivariate analysis and best subsets logistic regression. We selected a final model through a consensus process that balanced statistical significance with clinical relevance.
IS developed in 12 of 204 infants (6%). Multiple potential predictors were associated with IS, including Apgar scores, EEG features, seizure characteristics, MRI abnormalities, and clinical status at hospital discharge. The final model included three risk factors: (a) severely abnormal EEG or ≥3 days with seizures recorded on EEG, (b) deep gray or brainstem injury on MRI, and (c) abnormal tone on discharge exam. The stratified risk of IS was the following: no factors 0% (0/82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0%-4%), one or two factors 4% (4/108, 95% CI 1%-9%), and all three factors 57% (8/14, 95% CI 29%-83%).
IS risk after acute symptomatic neonatal seizures can be stratified using commonly available clinical data. No child without risk factors, vs >50% of those with all three factors, developed IS. This risk prediction rule may be valuable for clinical counseling as well as for selecting participants for clinical trials to prevent post-neonatal epilepsy.

Here we analyzed the relationship between preoperative cognition and anesthesia-induced brain dynamics. We hypothesized that patients with low cognitive performance would be more sensitive to anesthetics and would show differences in electroencephalogram (EEG) activity consistent with a brain anesthesia overdose.
This is a retrospective analysis from a previously reported observational study. We evaluated cognitive performance using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test. All patients received general anesthesia maintained with sevoflurane or desflurane during elective major abdominal surgery. We analyzed the EEG using spectral, coherence, and phase-amplitude modulation analyses.
Patients were separated into a low MoCA group (<26 points, n = 12) and a high MoCA group (n = 23). There were no differences in baseline EEG, nor end-tidal age-corrected minimum alveolar concentration (MACage). However, under anesthesia, the low MoCA group had lower α-β power (high MoCA: 2.9 [interquartile range {IQR}: 0.6-5.8 dB] versus low MoCA: -1.2 [IQR: -2.1 to 0.6 dB], difference 4.1 [1.0-5.7]) and a lower α peak frequency (high MoCA: 9.0 [IQR: 8.3-9.8 Hz] versus low MoCA: 7.5 [IQR: 6.3-9.0 Hz], difference 1.5 [0-2.3]) compared to the high MoCA group. The low MoCA group also had a lower α band coherence and a stronger peak-max phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Finally, patients in the low MoCA group had longer emergence times (high MoCA 663 ± 345 seconds versus low MoCA: 960 ± 352 seconds, difference 297 [15-578]). Multiple linear regression shows up that both age and MoCA scores are independently associated with intraoperative α-β power.

Due to the prolonged induction period in the slow injection group we were able to distinguish loss of responsiveness to verbal command (LOvR) from loss of responsiveness to painful stimulus (LOpR) whereas in the fast induction group we could not. At LOpR, we observed a higher relative alpha and beta power in the slow induction group while the relative power in the delta range was lower than in the fast induction group. When concentrating on the slow induction group the increase in relative alpha power pre-LOpR and even before LOvR indicated that frontal EEG patterns, which have been suggested as an indicator of unconsciousness, can develop before LOR. Further, LOvR was best reflected by an increase of the alpha to delta ratio, and LOpR was indicated by a decrease of the beta to alpha ratio. These findings highlight the different spectral properties of the EEG at various levels of responsiveness and underline the influence of the propofol injection rate on the frontal EEG during induction of general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33173114/

To assess its effect on cerebral activity of extremely preterm infants.
Retrospective study in infants less than 28 weeks of gestational age (GA), treated with morphine and monitored with amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG), that were assessed at baseline and 6 consecutive 2 h periods. At each period, the background activity score and presence of cycling were determined.
A total of 140 infants were included. Background aEEG activity score worsened in 40% of the infants by 6 h after morphine initiation and cycling, initially present in 70% of the infants, could be detected in only 10% after 10 h. On multivariable analysis, adjusted for baseline aEEG score and GA, the background activity decreased by 0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-0.97) immediately after morphine initiation, 0.72 (CI: 0.63-0.83) at 2 h later and on average by 0.64 (CI: 0.57-0.71) at each subsequent 2 h periods. The relative risk of cycling loss at 2 h and 4 h after morphine administration was 1.58 (CI: 1.15-2.16) and 3.37 (CI: 2.23-5.08), respectively.

Simplified continuous EEG (cEEG) and serum levels of NfL and GFAP, sampled at 24, 48 and 72 h after cardiac arrest, were collected during the Target Temperature Management (TTM)-trial. Two statistical methods were used: multivariable regresssion analysis; and a matched control group of patients without ESE matched for early predictors of poor neurological outcome.
128 patients had available biomarkers and cEEG. Twenty-six (20%) patients developed ESE, the majority (69%) within 24 h. ESE was an independent predictor of elevated serum NfL (p < 0.001) but not of serum GFAP (p = 0.16) at 72 h after cardiac arrest. Compared to a control group matched for early predictors of poor neurological outcome, patients who developed ESE had higher levels of serum NfL (p = 0.03) and GFAP (p = 0.04) at 72 h after cardiac arrest.
ESE after cardiac arrest is associated with higher levels of serum NfL which may suggest increased secondary neuronal injury compared to matched patients without ESE but similar initial brain injury. Associations with GFAP reflecting glial injury are less clear. The study design cannot exclude imperfect matching or other mechanisms of secondary brain injury contributing to the higher levels of biomarkers of brain injury seen in the patients with ESE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33127439/

As neurological examination is often unreliable in sedated patients, additional neuromonitoring is needed. However, the value of electroencephalogram (EEG) in adult ECMO patients has not been well assessed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of electroencephalographic abnormalities in patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and their association with 3-month neurologic outcome.
Retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing venous-venous (V-V) or venous-arterial (V-A) ECMO with a concomitant EEG recording (April 2009-December 2018), either recorded intermittently or continuously. EEG background was classified into four categories: mild/moderate encephalopathy (i.e., mostly defined by the presence of reactivity), severe encephalopathy (mostly defined by the absence of reactivity), burst-suppression (BS) and suppressed background. Epileptiform activity (i.e., ictal EEG pattern, sporadic epileptiform discharges or periodic discharges) and asymmetry were also reported. EEG findings were analyzed according to unfavorable neurological outcome (UO, defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale < 4) at 3 months after discharge.
A total of 139 patients (54 [41-62] years; 60 (43%) male gender) out of 596 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Veno-arterial (V-A) ECMO was used in 98 (71%); UO occurred in 99 (71%) patients. Continuous EEG was performed in 113 (81%) patients. The analysis of EEG background showed that 29 (21%) patients had severe encephalopathy, 4 (3%) had BS and 19 (14%) a suppressed background. In addition, 11 (8%) of patients had seizures or status epilepticus, 10 (7%) had generalized periodic discharges or lateralized periodic discharges, and 27 (19%) had asymmetry on EEG. In the multivariate analysis, the occurrence of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage (OR 4.57 [1.25-16.74]; p = 0.02) and a suppressed background (OR 10.08 [1.24-82.20]; p = 0.03) were independently associated with UO. After an adjustment for covariates, an increasing probability for UO was observed with more severe EEG background categories.
In adult patients treated with ECMO, EEG can identify patients with a high likelihood of poor outcome. In particular, suppressed background was independently associated with unfavorable neurological outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33126887/

The stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) recordings provide appropriate temporal and spatial resolution to study whole-brain dynamics; however, the feasibility to detect subcortical signals during anesthesia still needs to be studied with clinical evidence. Here, we focus on the amygdala to investigate if SEEG can be used to detect cortical and subcortical electrophysiological activity in anesthetized epileptic patients. Therefore, we present direct evidence in humans that SEEG indeed can be used to record cortical and subcortical electrophysiological activity during anesthesia. The study was carried out in propofol-anesthetized five epileptic patients. The electrophysiology activity of the amygdala and other cortical areas from anesthesia to the recovery of consciousness was investigated using stereo-EEG (SEEG). Results indicated that with the decrease of propofol concentration, power spectral density (PSD) in the delta band of the amygdala significantly decreased. When it was close to recovery, the correlation between the amygdala and ipsilateral temporal lobe significantly decreased followed by a considerable increase when awake. The findings of the current study suggest SEEG as an effective tool for providing direct evidence of the anesthesia mechanism.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33102588/

33094567,Dopamine D1 receptor in the NAc shell is involved in delayed emergence from isoflurane anesthesia in aged mice.,Brain and behavior,2021,"Zhang Y, Gui H, Hu L, Li C, Zhang J, Liang X","Delayed emergence after general anesthesia tends to occur in the elderly population, but the mechanism remains unclear. Apart from age-related pharmacokinetic changes, the aging-induced structural and functional alterations in the arousal-promoting neural substrates should be considered. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a crucial arousal-related nucleus, in which activating medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) could facilitate the arousal from natural sleep. Meanwhile, the dopaminergic systems decline with aging in multiple brain regions. However, whether the age-related decline in D1R in the NAc shell attenuates its arousal-promoting capacity from general anesthesia remains to be elucidated.
We first verified the delayed emergence from isoflurane anesthesia and examined the corresponding changes of electroencephalogram (EEG) power in aged mice. In turn, the arousal-modulating capacity of D1R was characterized in the young and aged cohorts by microinjection of D1R agonist/antagonist into the NAc shell. Furthermore, to address the possible mechanism responsible for the attenuated arousal-modulating capacity of the aged NAc, the expression of D1R in the NAc shell was measured and compared between young and aged mice.
Our data indicated that compared with young mice, the emergence time in aged mice was notably longer, while EEG power in δ band (1-4Hz) was significantly higher and power in β band (12-25Hz) was lower. Activating or inhibiting D1R in the NAc shell by microinjection D1R agonist/antagonist promoted or delayed the emergence process in young mice. Nevertheless, this modulation capacity of D1R in the NAc shell declined in aged mice, respectively. Meanwhile, downregulation of D1R expression in the NAc shell was detected in the aged brain.
Together, these results suggest that aging attenuates the arousal-modulating capacity of D1R in the NAc shell probably through downregulation of D1R expression therein, which may provide a potential explanation and a therapeutic target for increased sensitivity to anesthetics in the elderly patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33094567/
33093360,A Forensic Disassembly of the BIS Monitor.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2020,Connor CW,"The bispectral index (BIS) monitor has been available for clinical use for >20 years and has had an immense impact on academic activity in Anesthesiology, with >3000 articles referencing the bispectral index. Despite attempts to infer its algorithms by external observation, its operation has nevertheless remained undescribed, in contrast to the algorithms of other less commercially successful monitors of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity under anesthesia. With the expiration of certain key patents, the time is therefore ripe to examine the operation of the monitor on its own terms through careful dismantling, followed by extraction and examination of its internal software.
An A-2000 BIS Monitor (gunmetal blue case, amber monochrome display) was purchased on the secondary market. After identifying the major data processing and storage components, a set of free or inexpensive tools was used to retrieve and disassemble the monitor's onboard software. The software executes primarily on an ARMv7 microprocessor (Sharp/NXP LH77790B) and a digital signal processor (Texas Instruments TMS320C32). The device software can be retrieved directly from the monitor's hardware by using debugging interfaces that have remained in place from its original development.
Critical numerical parameters such as the spectral edge frequency (SEF), total power, and BIS values were retraced from external delivery at the device's serial port back to the point of their calculation in the extracted software. In doing so, the locations of the critical algorithms were determined. To demonstrate the validity of the technique, the algorithms for SEF and total power were disassembled, comprehensively annotated and compared to their theoretically ideal behaviors. A bug was identified in the device's implementation of the SEF algorithm, which can be provoked by a perfectly isoelectric EEG.
This article demonstrates that the electronic design of the A-2000 BIS Monitor does not pose any insuperable obstacles to retrieving its device software in hexadecimal machine code form directly from the motherboard. This software can be reverse engineered through disassembly and decompilation to reveal the methods by which the BIS monitor implements its algorithms, which ultimately must form the definitive statement of its function. Without further revealing any algorithms that might be considered trade secrets, the manufacturer of the BIS monitor should be encouraged to release the device software in its original format to place BIS-related academic literature on a firm theoretical foundation and to promote further academic development of EEG monitoring algorithms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33093360/
33079876,"Low Frontal Alpha Power Is Associated With the Propensity for Burst Suppression: An Electroencephalogram Phenotype for a ""Vulnerable Brain"".",Anesthesia and analgesia,2020,"Shao YR, Kahali P, Houle TT, Deng H, Colvin C, Dickerson BC, Brown EN, Purdon PL","A number of recent studies have reported an association between intraoperative burst suppression and postoperative delirium. These studies suggest that anesthesia-induced burst suppression may be an indicator of underlying brain vulnerability. A prominent feature of electroencephalogram (EEG) under propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia is the frontal alpha oscillation. This frontal alpha oscillation is known to decline significantly during aging and is generated by prefrontal brain regions that are particularly prone to age-related neurodegeneration. Given that burst suppression and frontal alpha oscillations are both associated with brain vulnerability, we hypothesized that anesthesia-induced frontal alpha power could also be associated with burst suppression.
We analyzed EEG data from a previously reported cohort in which 155 patients received propofol (n = 60) or sevoflurane (n = 95) as the primary anesthetic. We computed the EEG spectrum during stable anesthetic maintenance and identified whether or not burst suppression occurred during the anesthetic. We characterized the relationship between burst suppression and alpha power using logistic regression. We proposed 5 different models consisting of different combinations of potential contributing factors associated with burst suppression: (1) a Base Model consisting of alpha power; (2) an Extended Mechanistic Model consisting of alpha power, age, and drug dosing information; (3) a Clinical Confounding Factors Model consisting of alpha power, hypotension, and other confounds; (4) a Simplified Model consisting only of alpha power and propofol bolus administration; and (5) a Full Model consisting of all of these variables to control for as much confounding as possible.
All models show a consistent significant association between alpha power and burst suppression while adjusting for different sets of covariates, all with consistent effect size estimates. Using the Simplified Model, we found that for each decibel decrease in alpha power, the odds of experiencing burst suppression increased by 1.33-fold.
In this study, we show how a decrease in anesthesia-induced frontal alpha power is associated with an increased propensity for burst suppression, in a manner that captures individualized information above and beyond a patient's chronological age. Lower frontal alpha band power is strongly associated with higher propensity for burst suppression and, therefore, potentially higher risk of postoperative neurocognitive disorders. We hypothesize that low frontal alpha power and increased propensity for burst suppression together characterize a ""vulnerable brain"" phenotype under anesthesia that could be mechanistically linked to brain metabolism, cognition, and brain aging.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33079876/

We collected and analyzed 25-channel EEG from 7 patients (3 females, ages 41-56 years) undergoing surgical anesthesia with sevoflurane, and quantified the sensor space directed connectivity for every 1-s epoch using DTF. The resulting connectivity parameters were compared to corresponding parameters from our previous study (n = 8, patients anesthetized with propofol and remifentanil, but otherwise using a similar protocol). Statistical comparisons between and within studies were done using permutation statistics, a data driven algorithm based on the DTF-parameters was employed to classify the epochs as coming from awake or anesthetized state. According to results of the permutation tests, DTF-parameter topographies were significantly different between the awake and anesthesia state at the group level. However, the topographies were not significantly different when comparing results computed from sevoflurane and propofol data, neither in the awake nor in anesthetized state. Optimizing the algorithm for simultaneously having high sensitivity and specificity in classification yielded an accuracy of 95.1% (SE = 0.96%), with sensitivity of 98.4% (SE = 0.80%) and specificity of 94.8% (SE = 0.10%). These findings indicate that the DTF changes in a similar manner when humans undergo general anesthesia caused by two distinct anesthetic agents with different molecular mechanisms of action.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33064257/

In a previous study, we developed a clinical prediction rule using three clinical variables (age, acute encephalopathy category, clinically evident seizure[s] prior to CEEG initiation) and two electroencephalographic (EEG) variables (EEG background category and interictal discharges within the first 30 minutes of EEG) to identify patients at high risk for ESs for whom CEEG might be essential. In the current study, we aimed to validate the ES prediction model using an independent cohort.
The prospectively acquired validation cohort consisted of 314 consecutive critically ill children treated in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of a quaternary care referral hospital with acute encephalopathy undergoing clinically indicated CEEG. We calculated test characteristics using the previously developed prediction model in the validation cohort. As in the generation cohort study, we selected a 0.10 cutpoint to emphasize sensitivity.
The incidence of ESs in the validation cohort was 22%. The generation and validation cohorts were alike in most clinical and EEG characteristics. The ES prediction model was well calibrated and well discriminating in the validation cohort. The model had a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 37%, positive predictive value of 28%, and negative predictive value of 93%. If applied, the model would limit 31% of patients from undergoing CEEG while failing to identify 10% of patients with ESs. The model had similar performance characteristics in the generation and validation cohorts.
A model employing five readily available clinical and EEG variables performed well when validated in a new consecutive cohort. Implementation would substantially reduce CEEG utilization, although some patients with ESs would not be identified. This model may serve a critical role in targeting limited CEEG resources to critically ill children at highest risk for ESs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33063870/

We aimed to characterize EEG-recorded brain oscillations during increasing depth of anesthesia in a real-life surgical scenario. We hypothesized that alpha power and coherency will diminish as propofol dose increases between loss of consciousness (LOC) and an EEG burst suppression (BS) pattern.
This nonrandomized dose-response clinical trial with concurrent control included EEG monitoring in 16 patients receiving slowly increasing doses of propofol. We assessed 3 intraoperative EEG segments (LOC, middle-dose, and BS) with spectral analysis.
Alpha band power diminished with each step increase in propofol dose. Average alpha power and average delta power during the BS step (-1.4±3.8 and 6.2±3.1 dB, respectively) were significantly lower than during the LOC step (2.8±2.6; P=0.004 and 10.1±5.2 dB; P=0.03, respectively). Peak alpha power was significantly higher during the LOC (5.4±2.6 dB) compared with middle-dose (2.6±3.6; P=0.04) and BS (0.7±3.2; P=0.0002) steps. In addition, as propofol dose increased, alpha band coherence between the F7 and F8 electrodes decreased, whereas delta band coherence exhibited a biphasic response (initial increase between LOC and middle-dose steps and decrease between middle-dose and BS steps).
We report compelling data regarding EEG patterns associated with increases in propofol dose.

Further, it remains unclear whether neurological manifestations are primarily due to neurotropism of the virus, or indirect effects, like cerebral hypoxia.
We analysed the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of 19 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, performed at peak disease severity as part of their clinical management. Disease severity, respiratory failure, immune and metabolic dysfunction, sedation status, and neurological examination on the day of the EEG were noted.
Severe encephalopathy was confirmed in 13 patients, all with severe COVID-19; 10 remained comatose off sedation, and five of them had alpha coma (AC). Disease severity, sedation, immune and metabolic dysfunction were not different between those with AC and those without.
Severe COVID-19 encephalopathy is a principal cause of persisting coma after sedation withdrawal. The relatively high incidence of the rare AC pattern may reflect direct SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism with a predilection for the brainstem ascending reticular system.

The aim of this study was to determine whether PTI can be used for prediction of postoperative acute pain while surgical pleth index(SPI) applied as control. Eighty patients undergoing laparoscopic urological surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. Data of SPI, PTI and a sedative index-wavelet index(WLI) were recorded within last 10 min at the end of surgery. The postoperative pain scores (NRS, numerical rating scale) were obtained. The Bland-Altman analysis was used for evaluation of consistency between PTI and SPI, whereas receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used for the mean values of PTI, SPI, and WLI to distinguish between mild (NRS 0-3) and moderate-severe (NRS 4-10) pain, and calculate their ""best-fit"" cut-off values. Data from 76 patients were included for final analysis. There was a good agreement between SPI and PTI values at the end of surgery. The ROC analysis showed a cut-off PTI value of 53 to discriminate between mild and moderate-to-severe pain, while SPI is 44 for this discrimination. Further analysis indicated that PTI had a best predictive accuracy reflected by highest area under curve (AUC)(0.772, 95% CI: 0.661-0.860)with sensitivity(62.50%) and specificity(90.91%) and a best positive predictive value(83.3%,95% CI: 68.4-98.2%).

33038092,Anesthesia-Associated Periodic Discharges.,Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,2022,"Husari KS, Ritzl EK","Anesthetic agents have been widely used in the treatment of refractory status epilepticus and the medical management of increased intracranial pressure whenever the goal is therapeutic burst suppression. Periodic patterns typically consisting of generalized periodic discharges (GPDs) following emergence from anesthesia have been described in several case reports. However, their clinical significance and in particular whether these patterns are epileptiform remains unclear.
This is a single-center, retrospective, observational study examining EEG patterns following emergence from pharmacologically induced burst suppression. Clinical and EEG data were collected. Patients who developed GPDs following anesthetic wean were compared with those who did not.
Over 4.5 years, 14 patients developed GPDs related to anesthetic withdrawal. The GPDs had a frequency between 0.5 and 2.5 Hz. Generalized periodic discharges related to anesthetic withdrawal were transient, with a median duration of 40 hours (interquartile range, 24-48 hours). Notably, in all patients, the pattern was stimulus dependent. When compared with a control group of 19 consecutive patients who did not develop a generalized periodic pattern in the context of the anesthetic wean, there was no significant difference in the status epilepticus relapse between the two groups (29% vs. 44%; P = 0.63). Patients in the GPD group were more likely to be on pentobarbital (93% vs. 58%; P = 0.05) and were more likely to have concomitant systemic infection treated with antibiotics compared with the control group (86% vs. 42%; P = 0.02).
Generalized periodic patterns are common following the wean of intravenous anesthetics (particularly pentobarbital) and likely represent a transitional encephalopathic state in a subset of patients. Their morphology is distinct and can be differentiated from the reemergence of status epilepticus (if the latter was the indication for anesthetic treatment). Failure to recognize this pattern may lead to prolonged unnecessary treatments if it is mistaken for the emergence of seizure activity. The presence of concomitant systemic infection and associated antibiotic treatment may be risk factors for the development of this pattern.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33038092/
33027221,State entropy and burst suppression ratio can show contradictory information: A retrospective study.,European journal of anaesthesiology,2020,"Georgii MT, Pilge S, Schneider G, Kreuzer M","Burst suppression is a characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern that reflects very deep levels of general anaesthesia and may correlate with increased risk of adverse outcomes such as postoperative delirium. EEG-based monitors such as the Entropy Module estimate the level of anaesthesia (state entropy) and provide another index reflecting the occurrence of burst suppression, that is the ratio of burst and suppression (BSR). In the Entropy Module, state entropy and BSR are not interconnected, as they are in the bispectral index (BIS). Hence, state entropy and BSR may provide contradicting information regarding the level of anaesthesia.
We aimed to describe the frequency and characteristics of contradicting state entropy and BSR and to present possible strategies of how to act in these situations.
We based our analyses on state entropy and BSR trend recordings from 2551 patients older than 59 years that showed BSR was > 0 throughout their intervention under general anaesthesia. We determined the maximum state entropy when BSR was > 0, the minimum state entropy with BSR = 0 and the duration of high state entropy with BSR > 0. Further, we selected four exemplar patients to present details of how state entropy and BSR can contradict each other during anaesthesia.
We observed a wide range of state entropy values with BSR > 0. The median [IQR] of the maximum state entropy with BSR > 0 was 53 [45 to 61] and the median of the minimum state entropy without BSR was 21 [15 to 26]. Contradictory BSR and state entropy could persist over several minutes. The presented cases highlight these contradictory BSR and state entropy situations.
Our results illustrate contradictory state entropy and BSR indices that may be relevant for anaesthesia navigation. Longer-lasting episodes may lead to incorrect titration of the depth of the hypnotic component of anaesthesia. Hence, our results demonstrate the necessity to monitor and check the raw EEG or EEG parameters that are less processed than the commercially available indices to safely navigate anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33027221/

Despite these promising results, the band- specific neural substrates of brain changes which occur during sevoflurane anesthesia have not yet been investigated. To this end, we employ high-density EEG-based brain connectivity estimates and graph theoretical analysis in a protocol of progressive sevoflurane administration (conditions: baseline, 1.1%, 2.1%, 2.8%, recovery), both at a global (whole-brain) and at a local (sensor-specific) level in 12 healthy subjects (7 males, mean age 25 ± 4.7 years). We show a statistically significant dependence of global strength, clustering coefficient and efficiency on sevoflurane concentration in the slow delta, beta 1 and beta 2 bands.

In this work, we measure the accuracy and false positive rate in detecting motor imagery of several deep learning models (EEGNet, deep convolutional network and shallow convolutional network) directly trained on filtered EEG data. We compare them with efficient non-deep approaches, namely, a linear discriminant analysis based on common spatial patterns, the minimum distance to Riemannian mean algorithm applied to covariance matrices, a logistic regression based on a tangent space projection of covariance matrices (TS+LR). The EEGNet improves significantly the classification performance comparing to other classifiers (p- value <; 0.01); moreover it outperforms the best non-deep classifier (TS+LR) for 7.2% of accuracy. This approach promises to improve intraoperative awareness detection during general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33017950/

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,2020,"Patlatzoglou K, Chennu S, Gosseries O, Bonhomme V, Wolff A, Laureys S","Neuroscience has generated a number of recent advances in the search for the neural correlates of consciousness, but these have yet to find valuable real-world applications. Electroencephalography under anesthesia provides a powerful experimental setup to identify electrophysiological signatures of altered states of consciousness, as well as a testbed for developing systems for automatic diagnosis and prognosis of awareness in clinical settings. In this work, we use deep convolutional neural networks to automatically differentiate sub-anesthetic states and depths of anesthesia, solely from one second of raw EEG signal. Our results with leave-one-participant-out-cross-validation show that behavioral measures, such as the Ramsay score, can be used to learn generalizable neural networks that reliably predict levels of unconsciousness in unseen transitional anesthetic states, as well as in unseen experimental setups and behaviors. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning to detect progressive changes in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness with higher granularity than behavioral or pharmacological markers. This work has broader significance for identifying generalized patterns of brain activity that index states of consciousness.Clinical Relevance- In the United States alone, over 100,000 people receive general anesthesia every day, from which up to 1% is affected by unintended intraoperative awareness [1]. Despite this, brain-based monitoring of consciousness is not common in the clinic, and has had mixed success [2]. Given this context, our aim is to develop and explore an automated deep learning model that accurately predicts and interprets the depth and quality of anesthesia from the raw EEG signal.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33017948/

This prospective, single-centre observational study enrolled children aged 2-10 yr old under sevoflurane anaesthesia. ED was assessed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV or 5 criteria. The relative power of low-frequency (delta and theta) and high-frequency (alpha and beta) EEG waves during the emergence period was compared between the children with and without ED. The linear relationships between the relative power and peak Paediatric Assessment of Emergence Delirium (PAED) score were investigated.
Among the 60 patients, 22 developed ED (ED group), whereas the other 38 did not (non-ED group). The relative power of the delta wave was higher (mean [standard deviation], 0.579 [0.083] vs 0.453 [0.090], respectively, P<0.001) in the ED group, whereas that of the alpha and beta waves was lower in the ED group, than in the non-ED group (0.155 [0.063] vs 0.218 [0.088], P=0.005 and 0.114 [0.069] vs 0.186 [0.070], P<0.001, respectively). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the relative power of the delta wave, low-to-high frequency power ratio, and delta-to-alpha ratio were 0.837 (95% confidence interval, 0.737-0.938), 0.835 (0.735-0.934), and 0.768 (0.649-0.887), respectively. The relative power of the delta wave and the two ratios had a positive linear relationship with the peak PAED scores.

In this education article, we describe our approach to TIVA dosing in infants and toddlers (birth to 36 months) which combines the use of pharmacokinetic models with EEG multi-parameter analysis. Pharmacokinetic models describe propofol and remifentanil effect site concentrations (Ce) over time in different age groups for a given dosing regimen. These models display substantial biological variability between individuals within age groups, impeding their application to clinical practice. Nevertheless, they reveal that younger infants require a higher propofol loading dose, a lower propofol maintenance dose, and a higher remifentanil dose compared with older infants. Proprietary EEG indices (eg, Bispectral Index) can serve as a biomarker of propofol Ce in adults and children to guide dosing to the individual patient; however, they are not recommended for infants as their validity remains uncertain this population. In our experience, EEG waveforms and processed parameters can reflect propofol Ce in infants, reflected by spectral edge frequency (SEF), density spectral array (DSA), and waveform patterns. In our practice, we use a ""lookup table"" of age-based dosing regimens or target-controlled infusion (TCI) based on the pharmacokinetic models to deliver a target propofol Ce and co-administer remifentanil and/or regional technique for analgesia. We analyze Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms, SEF, and DSA to adjust the propofol dose or TCI target concentration to the individual infant. EEG analysis mitigates against biological variability inherent in the pharmacokinetic models and has improved our experience with TIVA for infants.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32965066/
32930729,Granger Causality of the Electroencephalogram Reveals Abrupt Global Loss of Cortical Information Flow during Propofol-induced Loss of Responsiveness.,Anesthesiology,2020,"Pullon RM, Yan L, Sleigh JW, Warnaby CE","It is a commonly held view that information flow between widely separated regions of the cerebral cortex is a necessary component in the generation of wakefulness (also termed ""connected"" consciousness). This study therefore hypothesized that loss of wakefulness caused by propofol anesthesia should be associated with loss of information flow, as estimated by the effective connectivity in the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.
Effective connectivity during anesthesia was quantified by applying bivariate Granger to multichannel EEG data recorded from 16 adult subjects undergoing a slow induction of, and emergence from, anesthesia with intravenous propofol. During wakefulness they were conducting various auditory and motor tasks. Functional connectivity using EEG coherence was also estimated.
There was an abrupt, substantial, and global decrease in effective connectivity around the point of loss of responsiveness. Recovery of behavioral responsiveness was associated with a comparable recovery in information flow pattern (expressed as normalized values). The median (interquartile range) change was greatest in the delta frequency band: decreasing from 0.15 (0.21) 2 min before loss of behavioral response, to 0.06 (0.04) 2 min after loss of behavioral response (P < 0.001). Regional decreases in information flow were maximal in a posteromedial direction from lateral frontal and prefrontal regions (0.82 [0.24] 2 min before loss of responsiveness, decreasing to 0.17 [0.05] 2 min after), and least for information flow from posterior channels. The widespread decrease in bivariate Granger causality reflects loss of cortical coordination. The relationship between functional connectivity (coherence) and effective connectivity (Granger causality) was inconsistent.
Propofol-induced unresponsiveness is marked by a global decrease in information flow, greatest from the lateral frontal and prefrontal brain regions in a posterior and medial direction. Loss of information flow may be a useful measure of connected consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32930729/

Three resting-state EEG datasets were used in the study (N = 29, N = 21 and N = 20). We estimated the pre-anesthesia strength and fluctuations of frontal-parietal functional connectivity by using sliding-window analysis. Propofol served as the sole anesthetic drug, and it was administered by using a target-controlled infusion system. Individual susceptibility to propofol was assessed by the induction time, from infusion onset until a bispectral index value of 60 was reached, for subjects in dataset-1 and dataset-2, and susceptibility was assessed by behavioral data for subjects in the external dataset.
We observed in the three datasets that subjects with high susceptibility to propofol had lower pre-anesthesia strength and lower fluctuation of frontal-parietal functional connectivity than the low-susceptibility group at alpha band. Moreover, the induction time was significantly correlated with the estimated pre-anesthesia frontal-parietal functional connectivity measures. We also validated the robustness of these findings by using different window lengths in sliding-window analysis.
Subjects with weaker pre-anesthesia dynamic frontal-parietal communication are more likely to be anesthetized.
These observations suggest that the titration procedure for propofol should consider the pre-anesthesia brain functional state.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32927212/

This exploratory, single-center, randomized clinical trial included patients who were ≥65 years of age undergoing elective noncardiac surgery. The study aimed to determine whether monitoring the brain using a processed EEG monitor reduced EEG suppression and subsequent postoperative delirium. The interventional group received processed EEG-guided anesthetic management to keep the Patient State Index (PSI) above 35 computed by the SEDline Brain Function Monitor (Masimo, Inc, Irvine, CA), while the standard care group was also monitored, but the EEG data were blinded from the clinicians. The primary outcome was intraoperative EEG suppression. A secondary outcome was incident postoperative delirium during the first 3 days after surgery.
All outcomes were analyzed using the intention-to-treat paradigm. Two hundred and four patients with a mean age of 72 ± 5 years were studied. Minutes of EEG suppression adjusted by the length of surgery was found to be less for the interventional group than the standard care group (median [interquartile range], 1.4% [5.0%] and 2.5% [10.4%]; Hodges-Lehmann estimated median difference [95% confidence interval {CI}] of -0.8% [-2.1 to -0.000009]). The effect of the intervention on EEG suppression differed for those with and without preoperative cognitive impairment (interaction P = .01), with the estimated incidence rate ratio (95% CI) of 0.39 (0.33-0.44) for those with preoperative cognitive impairment and 0.48 (0.44-0.51) for those without preoperative cognitive impairment. The incidence of delirium was not found to be different between the interventional (17%) and the standard care groups (20%), risk ratio = 0.85 (95% CI, 0.47-1.5).
The use of processed EEG to maintain the PSI >35 was associated with less time spent in intraoperative EEG suppression. Preoperative cognitive impairment was associated with a greater percent of surgical time spent in EEG suppression. A larger prospective cohort study to include more cognitively vulnerable patients is necessary to show whether an intervention to reduce EEG suppression is efficacious in reducing postoperative delirium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32925344/

Relation between these sources should be time independent, that is, perfectly synchronized. In reality, various issues corrupt time independency, leading to asynchrony or, in other words, hysteresis. This asynchrony can lead to conflicting information, making effective drug dosing challenging. In this study, we tried to quantify and minimize the hysteresis between the Ceprop (calculated using the Schnider model for propofol) and EEG measured drug effect, using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM). Further, we measured the influence of EEG-based monitor choice, namely Bispectral index (BIS) versus qCON index (qCON) monitor, on propofol PD hysteresis.
We analyzed the PD data from 165 patients undergoing propofol-remifentanil anesthesia for outpatient surgery. Drugs were administered using target-controlled infusion (TCI) pumps. Pumps were programmed with Schnider model for propofol and Minto model for remifentanil. We constructed 2 PD models (direct models) relating the Schnider Ceprop to the measured BIS and qCON monitor values. We quantified the models' misspecification due to hysteresis, on an individual level, using the root mean squared errors (RMSEs). Subsequently, we optimized the PD models' predictions by adding a lag term to both models (lag-time PD models) and quantified the optimization using the RMSE.
There is a counterclockwise hysteresis between Ceprop and BIS/qCON values. Not accounting for this hysteresis results in a direct PD model with an effect-site concentration which produces 50% of the maximal drug effect (Ce50) of 6.24 and 8.62 µg/mL and RMSE (median and interquartile range [IQR]) of 9.38 (7.92-11.23) and 8.41(7.04-10.2) for BIS and qCON, respectively. Adding a modeled lag factor of 49 seconds to the BIS model and 53 seconds to the qCON model improved both models' prediction, resulting in similar Ce50 (3.66 and 3.62 µg/mL for BIS and qCON) and lower RMSE (median (IQR) of 7.87 (6.49-9.90) and 6.56 (5.28-8.57) for BIS and qCON.
There is a significant ""Ceprop versus EEG measured drug effect"" hysteresis. Not accounting for it leads to conflicting PD information and false high Ce50 for propofol in both monitors. Adding a lag term improved the PD model performance, improved the ""pump-monitor"" synchrony, and made the estimates of Ce50 for propofol more realistic and less monitor dependent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32925339/

Determining the drug requirements of a specific patient is a fundamental problem in medicine. Our current approach uses population-based pharmacological models to establish dosing. However, individual patients, and children in particular, may respond to drugs differently. In anesthesiology, we have the advantage that we can monitor our patients in real time and titrate drugs to the desired effect. Examples include blood pressure management or muscle relaxation. Although the brain is the primary site of action for sedative-hypnotic drugs, the brain is not routinely monitored during general anesthesia or sedation, a fact that would surprise many patients. One reason for this is that, until recently, physiologically principled approaches for anesthetic brain monitoring have not been articulated. In the past few years, our knowledge of anesthetic brain mechanisms has developed rapidly. We now know that anesthetic drug effects are clearly visible in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of adults and reflect underlying anesthetic pharmacology and brain mechanisms. Most recently, similar effects have been characterized in children. In this article, we describe how EEG monitoring could be used to guide anesthetic management in pediatric patients. We review previous evidence and present multiple case studies showing how drug-specific and dose-dependent EEG signatures seen in adults are visible in children and infants, including those with neurological disorders. We propose that the EEG can be used in the anesthetic care of children to enable anesthesiologists to better assess the drug requirements of individual patients in real time and improve patient safety and experience.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32925322/

Intra-operative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is uniquely capable of detecting onset of neurological dysfunction in anesthetized patients, thereby precisely defining time last electrically well (LEW). This novel parameter may aid in the detection of large vessel occlusion (LVO) and prompt treatment with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).
We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained AIS and LVO database from May 2018-August 2019. Inclusion criteria required any surgical procedure under general anesthesia (GA) utilizing EEG (electroencephalography) and/or SSEP (somatosensory evoked potentials) monitoring with development of intraoperative focal persistent changes using predefined alarm criteria and who were considered for EVT.
Five cases were identified. LKW to closure time ranged from 66 to 321 minutes, while LEW to closure time ranged from 43 to 174 min. All LVOs were in the anterior circulation. Angiography was not pursued in two cases due to large established infarct (both patients expired in the hospital). EVT was pursued in two cases with successful recanalization and spontaneous recanalization was noted in one patient (mRS 0-3 at 90 days was achieved in all 3 cases).
This study demonstrates that significant IONM changes can accurately identify patients with an acute LVO in the operative setting.

Ketamine's analgesic properties have been suggested to result from its dissociative properties. To the authors' knowledge, this postulate is unsubstantiated. The authors hypothesize that the dissociative and analgesic properties of ketamine are independent.
The authors conducted a single-site, open-label study of ketamine anesthesia (2 mg/kg) in 15 healthy subjects. Midazolam was administered at a prespecified time point to attenuate dissociation. The authors longitudinally assessed precalibrated cuff pain intensity and quality using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System questionnaires, and dissociation, using the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale. Mixed effects models were used to assess whether dissociation accounted for the effect of ketamine on pain intensity and quality.
The dissociation model demonstrated an inverted U-shaped quadratic relationship between time and dissociation scores. Additive to this effect, midazolam reduced the dissociation adjusted means by 10.3 points (95% CI, 3.4 to 17.1; P = 0.005). The pain intensity model also demonstrated a U-shaped quadratic relationship between time and pain intensity. When the pain intensity model was reanalyzed with dissociation scores as an additional covariate, the dissociation term was not retained in the model, and the other effects were preserved in direction and strength. This result was conserved for nociceptive and neuropathic pain quality.
Ketamine's analgesic properties are not exclusively caused by dissociation. Thus, ketamine may be used as a probe to advance our knowledge of dissociation independent neural circuits that encode pain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32898213/
32896634,A methodological framework for inverse-modeling of propagating cortical activity using MEG/EEG.,NeuroImage,2020,Hindriks R,"The prevailing view on the dynamics of large-scale electrical activity in the human cortex is that it constitutes a functional network of discrete and localized circuits. Within this view, a natural way to analyse magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data is by adopting methods from network theory. Invasive recordings, however, demonstrate that cortical activity is spatially continuous, rather than discrete, and exhibits propagation behavior. Furthermore, human cortical activity is known to propagate under a variety of conditions such as non-REM sleep, general anesthesia, and coma. Although several MEG/EEG studies have investigated propagating cortical activity, not much is known about the conditions under which such activity can be successfully reconstructed from MEG/EEG sensor-data. This study provides a methodological framework for inverse-modeling of propagating cortical activity. Within this framework, cortical activity is represented in the spatial frequency domain, which is more natural than the dipole domain when dealing with spatially continuous activity. We define angular power spectra, which show how the power of cortical activity is distributed across spatial frequencies, angular gain/phase spectra, which characterize the spatial filtering properties of linear inverse operators, and angular resolution matrices, which summarize how linear inverse operators leak signal within and across spatial frequencies. We adopt the framework to provide insight into the performance of several linear inverse operators in reconstructing propagating cortical activity from MEG/EEG sensor-data. We also describe how prior spatial frequency information can be incorporated into the inverse-modeling to obtain better reconstructions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32896634/

The field of machine learning offers algorithms for both parameter selection and combination. In this study, several established machine learning approaches including a method for the selection of suitable signal parameters and classification algorithms are applied to construct an index which predicts responsiveness in anesthetized patients. The present analysis considers several classification algorithms, among those support vector machines, artificial neural networks and Bayesian learning algorithms. On the basis of data from the transition between consciousness and unconsciousness, a combination of EEG and AEP signal parameters developed with automated methods provides a maximum prediction probability of 0.935, which is higher than 0.916 (for EEG parameters) and 0.880 (for AEP parameters) using a cross-validation approach. This suggests that machine learning techniques can successfully be applied to develop an improved combined EEG and AEP parameter to separate consciousness from unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32845935/
32833715,"Relationship Between Propofol Target Concentrations, Bispectral Index, and Patient Covariates During Anesthesia.",Anesthesia and analgesia,2021,"Schnider TW, Minto CF, Egan TD, Filipovic M","Internationally, propofol is commonly titrated by target-controlled infusion (TCI) to maintain a processed electroencephalographic (EEG) parameter (eg, bispectral index [BIS]) within a specified range. The overall variability in propofol target effect-site concentrations (CeT) necessary to maintain adequate anesthesia in real-world conditions is poorly characterized, as are the patient demographic factors that contribute to this variability. This study explored these issues, hypothesizing that the variability in covariate-adjusted propofol target concentrations during BIS-controlled anesthesia would be substantial and that most of the remaining interpatient variability in drug response would be due to random effects, thus suggesting that the opportunity to improve on the Schnider model with further demographic data is limited.
With ethics committee approval and a waiver of informed consent, a deidentified, high-resolution, intraoperative database consisting of propofol target concentrations, BIS values, and vital signs from 13,239 patients was mined to identify patients who underwent general endotracheal anesthesia using propofol (titrated to BIS), fentanyl, remifentanil, and rocuronium that lasted at least 1 hour. The propofol target concentrations and BIS values 30 minutes after incision (CeT30 and BIS30) were considered representative of stable intraoperative conditions. The data were plotted and analyzed by descriptive statistics. Confidence intervals were computed using a bootstrap method. A linear model was fit to the data to test for correlation with factors of interest (eg, age and weight).
A total of 4584 patients met inclusion criteria and were entered into the analysis. Of the propofol target concentrations, 95% were between 1.5 and 3.5 µg·mL-1. Higher BIS30 values were correlated with higher propofol concentrations. Except for age, all the patient-related variables analyzed entered the regression model linearly. Only 10.2% of the variability in CeT30 was explained by the patient factors of age and weight combined.
Our hypothesis was confirmed. The variability in covariate-adjusted propofol CeT30 titrated to BIS in real-world conditions is considerable, and only a small portion of the remaining variability in drug response is explained by patient demographic factors. This finding may have important implications for the development of new pharmacokinetic (PK) models for propofol TCI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32833715/

Kv4.2 mRNA and protein expression as well as function are reduced in several genetic and pharmacologically induced rodent models of epilepsy and autism. It is not known, however, whether reduced Kv4.2 is just an epiphenomenon or a disease-contributing cause of neuronal hyperexcitability and behavioral impairments in these neurological disorders. To address this question, we used male and female mice heterozygous for a Kv.2 deletion and adult-onset manipulation of hippocampal Kv4.2 expression in male mice to assess the role of Kv4.2 in regulating neuronal network excitability, morphology and anxiety-related behaviors. We observed a reduction in dendritic spine density and reduced proportions of thin and stubby spines but no changes in anxiety, overall activity, or retention of conditioned freezing memory in Kv4.2 heterozygous mice compared with wildtype littermates. Using EEG analyses, we showed elevated theta power and increased spike frequency in Kv4.2 heterozygous mice under basal conditions. In addition, the latency to onset of kainic acid-induced seizures was significantly shortened in Kv4.2 heterozygous mice compared with wildtype littermates, which was accompanied by a significant increase in theta power. By contrast, overexpressing Kv4.2 in wildtype mice through intrahippocampal injection of Kv4.2-expressing lentivirus delayed seizure onset and reduced EEG power. These results suggest that Kv4.2 is an important regulator of neuronal network excitability and dendritic spine morphology, but not anxiety-related behaviors. In the future, manipulation of Kv4.2 expression could be used to alter seizure susceptibility in epilepsy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32822706/
32813139,Technical considerations when using the EEG export of the SEDLine Root device.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2021,"von Dincklage F, Jurth C, Schneider G, S García P, Kreuzer M","Electroencephalographic (EEG) patient monitoring during general anesthesia can help to assess the real-time neurophysiology of unconscious states. Some monitoring systems like the SEDLine Root allow export of the EEG to be used for retrospective analysis. We show that changes made to the SEDLine display during recording affected the recorded EEG. These changes can strongly impact retrospective analysis of EEG signals. Real-time changes of the feed speed in the SEDLine Root device display modifies the sampling rate of the exported EEG. We used a patient as well as a simulated EEG recording to highlight the effects of the display settings on the extracted EEG. Therefore, we changed EEG feed and amplitude resolution on the display in a systematic manner. To visualize the effects of these changes, we present raw EEG segments and the density spectral array of the recording. Changing the display's amplitude resolution affects the amplitudes. If the amplitude resolution is too fine, the exported EEG contains clipped amplitudes. If the resolution is too coarse, the EEG resolution becomes too low leading to a low-quality signal making frequency analysis impossible. The proportion of clipped or zero-line data caused by the amplitude setting was > 60% in our sedated patient. Changing the display settings results in undocumented changes in EEG amplitude, sampling rate, and signal quality. The occult nature of these changes could make the analysis of data sets difficult if not invalid. We strongly suggest researchers adequately define and keep the EEG display settings to export good quality EEG and to ensure comparability among patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32813139/

For patients whose families face time-sensitive, life-or-death decisions, treatments that promote recovery of consciousness are needed to reduce the likelihood of premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, facilitate autonomous self-expression, and increase access to rehabilitative care. Here, we present the Connectome-based Clinical Trial Platform (CCTP), a new paradigm for developing and testing targeted therapies that promote early recovery of consciousness in the ICU. We report the protocol for STIMPACT (Stimulant Therapy Targeted to Individualized Connectivity Maps to Promote ReACTivation of Consciousness), a CCTP-based trial in which intravenous methylphenidate will be used for targeted stimulation of dopaminergic circuits within the subcortical ascending arousal network (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03814356). The scientific premise of the CCTP and the STIMPACT trial is that personalized brain network mapping in the ICU can identify patients whose connectomes are amenable to neuromodulation. Phase 1 of the STIMPACT trial is an open-label, safety and dose-finding study in 22 patients with disorders of consciousness caused by acute severe traumatic brain injury. Patients in Phase 1 will receive escalating daily doses (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) of intravenous methylphenidate over a 4-day period and will undergo resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography to evaluate the drug's pharmacodynamic properties. The primary outcome measure for Phase 1 relates to safety: the number of drug-related adverse events at each dose. Secondary outcome measures pertain to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: (1) time to maximal serum concentration; (2) serum half-life; (3) effect of the highest tolerated dose on resting-state functional MRI biomarkers of connectivity; and (4) effect of each dose on EEG biomarkers of cerebral cortical function. Predetermined safety and pharmacodynamic criteria must be fulfilled in Phase 1 to proceed to Phase 2A. Pharmacokinetic data from Phase 1 will also inform the study design of Phase 2A, where we will test the hypothesis that personalized connectome maps predict therapeutic responses to intravenous methylphenidate. Likewise, findings from Phase 2A will inform the design of Phase 2B, where we plan to enroll patients based on their personalized connectome maps. By selecting patients for clinical trials based on a principled, mechanistic assessment of their neuroanatomic potential for a therapeutic response, the CCTP paradigm and the STIMPACT trial have the potential to transform the therapeutic landscape in the ICU and improve outcomes for patients with severe brain injuries.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32794142/

Data interpretation usually occurs by expert personnel (e.g., epileptologists, neurophysiologists), with information relayed to the primary care team. However, data cannot always be read in time-sensitive fashion, leading to potential delays in EEG interpretation and patient management. Multiple training programs have recently been described to enable non-experts to rapidly interpret EEG at the bedside. A comprehensive review of these training programs, including the tools used, outcomes obtained, and potential pitfalls, is currently lacking. Therefore, the optimum training program and implementation strategy remain unknown.
We will conduct a systematic review of descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials assessing training programs for EEG interpretation by non-experts. Our primary objective is to comprehensively review educational programs in this domain and report their structure, patterns of implementation, limitations, and trainee feedback. Our secondary objective will be to compare the performance of non-experts for EEG interpretation with a gold standard (e.g., interpretation by a certified electroencephalographers). Studies will be limited to those performed in acute care settings in both adult and pediatric populations (intensive care unit, emergency department, or post-anesthesia care units). Comprehensive search strategies will be developed for MEDLINE, EMBASE, WoS, CINAHL, and CENTRAL to identify studies for review. The gray literature will be scanned for further eligible studies. Two reviewers will independently screen the search results to identify studies for inclusion. A standardized data extraction form will be used to collect important data from each study. If possible, we will attempt to meta-analyze the quantitative data. If heterogeneity between studies is too high, we will present meaningful quantitative comparisons of secondary outcomes as per the synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) reporting guidelines.
We will aim to summarize the current literature in this domain to understand the structure, patterns, and pitfalls of EEG training programs for non-experts. This review is undertaken with a view to inform future education designs, potentially enabling rapid detection of EEG abnormalities, and timely intervention by the treating physician.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been a standard intraoperative monitor for 30 years. Electroencephalogram (EEG) can provide valuable information about the anesthetized state and guide anesthesia management during surgery. Whether EEG should be a standard intraoperative monitor is discussed in this review.
Deep anesthesia has been associated with postoperative delirium, especially in elderly patients. Intraoperative EEG monitoring has been demonstrated to reduce total anesthesia drug use during general anesthesia and postoperative delirium.
Unlike ECG monitoring, the EEG under general anesthesia has not been designated as a standard monitor by anesthesiologist societies around the world. The processed EEG technology has been commercially available for more than 25 years and EEG technology has significantly facilitated its intraoperative use.

However, the topographical spectral information for each predominate microstate is still unclear during the switch of consciousness, such as sedation, and the practical usage of the EEG microstate is worth probing. Also, the mechanism behind the anesthetic-induced alternations of brain states remains poorly understood. In this study, an advanced EEG microstate spectral analysis was utilized using multivariate empirical mode decomposition in Hilbert-Huang transform. The practicability was further investigated in scalp EEG recordings during the propofol-induced transition of consciousness. The process of transition from the awake baseline to moderate sedation was accompanied by apparent increases in microstate (A, B, and F) energy, especially in the whole-brain delta band, frontal alpha band and beta band. In comparison to other effective EEG-based parameters that commonly used to measure anesthetic depth, using the selected spectral features reached better performance (80% sensitivity, 90% accuracy) to estimate the brain states during sedation. The changes in microstate energy also exhibited high correlations with individual behavioral data during sedation. In a nutshell, the EEG microstate spectral analysis is an effective method to estimate brain states during propofol-induced sedation, giving great insights into the underlying mechanism. The generated spectral features can be promising markers to dynamically assess the consciousness level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32749987/

Whilst the influence of ageing on anaesthesia-induced electroencephalogram (EEG) changes has been investigated, the effect of comorbidities has not yet been explored. We hypothesised that certain diseases significantly affect frontal EEG alpha and broadband power in cardiac surgical patients.
We analysed the frontal EEGs of 589 patients undergoing isoflurane general anaesthesia from a prospective observational study. We used multi- and uni-variable regression to analyse the relationships between comorbidities and age as independent with peak and oscillatory alpha, and broadband power as dependent variables. A score of comorbidities and minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) was built to interrogate the combined effect of age and score on alpha and broadband power.
At the univariable level, many comorbidities were associated with lower EEG alpha or broadband power. Multivariable regression indicated the independent association of numerous comorbidities and MAC with peak alpha (R
Comorbidities and age are independently associated with decreasing frontal EEG alpha and broadband power during general anaesthesia. For alpha power, the association is highly dependent on the underlying broadband effect. These findings might have significant clinical consequences for automated computation for depth of anaesthesia in comorbid patients, because misclassification might pose the risk of under- or over-dosing of anaesthetics.

An EEG analog front-end (AFE) that can compensate ±380-mV electrode DC offset using a coarse digital DC servo loop is implemented in the proposed system. The EEG-based MAC, EEGMAC, is introduced as a novel index to accurately predict the DoA, which is designed for applying to patients anesthetized by both volatile and intravenous agents. The proposed deep learning protocol consists of four layers of convolutional neural network and two dense layers. In addition, we optimize the complexity of the deep neural network (DNN) to operate on a microcomputer such as the Raspberry Pi 3, realizing a cost-effective small-size DoA monitoring system. Fabricated in 110-nm CMOS, the prototype AFE consumes 4.33 μW per channel and has the input-referred noise of 0.29 μVrms from 0.5 to 100 Hz with the noise efficiency factor of 2.2. The proposed DNN was evaluated with pre-recorded EEG data from 374 subjects administrated by inhalational anesthetics under surgery, achieving an average squared and absolute errors of 0.048 and 0.05, respectively. The EEGMAC with subjects anesthetized by an intravenous agent also showed a good agreement with the bispectral index value, confirming the proposed DoA index is applicable to both anesthetics. The implemented monitoring system with the Raspberry Pi 3 estimates the EEGMAC within 20 ms, which is about thousand-fold faster than the BIS estimation in literature.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32746339/

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between intraoperative motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring and the results of preoperative BTO. Between 2013 and 2017, 32 patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia with intraoperative MEP monitoring, in whom preoperative BTO was performed, were identified. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the appropriate cutoff value of MEP amplitude for BTO-positive. Furthermore, the accuracy of MEP monitoring for BTO-positive was compared with electroencephalogram (EEG) and somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) monitoring. Four of 32 (12.5%) patients were BTO-positive. The cutoff value of MEP amplitude for BTO-positive was a > 80% reduction from the baseline level, which showed sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100%. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity for BTO-positive were significantly higher for MEP than for EEG (100% and 72.0%, p = 0.02) in 28 patients, but they were not significantly different compared with SEP (33.3% and 100%, p = 0.48) in 21 patients.

32720644,An electrophysiological marker of arousal level in humans.,eLife,2020,"Lendner JD, Helfrich RF, Mander BA, Romundstad L, Lin JJ, Walker MP, Larsson PG, Knight RT","Deep non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and general anesthesia with propofol are prominent states of reduced arousal linked to the occurrence of synchronized oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Although rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is also associated with diminished arousal levels, it is characterized by a desynchronized, 'wake-like' EEG. This observation implies that reduced arousal states are not necessarily only defined by synchronous oscillatory activity. Using intracranial and surface EEG recordings in four independent data sets, we demonstrate that the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, delineates wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, NREM and REM sleep. Critically, the spectral slope discriminates wakefulness from REM sleep solely based on the neurophysiological brain state. Taken together, our findings describe a common electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including different sleep stages as well as anesthesia in humans.
Electroencephalogram (EEG for short) is a widespread technique that helps to monitor the electrical activity of the brain. In particular, it can be used to examine, recognize and compare different states of brain consciousness such as sleep, wakefulness or general anesthesia. Yet, during rapid eye movement sleep (the sleep phase in which dreaming occurs), the electrical activity of the brain is similar to the one recorded during wakefulness, making it difficult to distinguish these states based on EEG alone. EEG records brain activity in the shape of rhythmic waves whose frequency, shape and amplitude vary depending on the state of consciousness. In the EEG signal from the human brain, the higher frequency waves are weaker than the low-frequency waves: a measure known as spectral slope reflects the degree of this difference in the signal strength. Previous research suggests that spectral slope can be used to distinguish wakefulness from anesthesia and non-REM sleep. Here, Lendner et al. explored whether certain elements of the spectral slope could also discern wakefulness from all states of reduced arousal. EEG readings were taken from patients and volunteers who were awake, asleep or under anesthesia, using electrodes placed either on the scalp or into the brain. Lendner et al. found that the spectral slope could distinguish wakefulness from anesthesia, deep non-REM and REM sleep. The changes in the spectral slope during sleep could accurately track the degree of arousal with great temporal precision and across a wide range of time scales. This method means that states of consciousness can be spotted just from a scalp EEG. In the future, this approach could be embedded into the techniques used for monitoring sleep or anesthesia during operations; it could also be harnessed to monitor other low-response states, such as comas.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32720644/

We performed a prospective observational cohort study of 719 consecutive critically ill children with encephalopathy. We evaluated baseline clinical risk factors (age and prior clinically evident seizures) and emergent CEEG risk factors (epileptiform discharges and ictal-interictal continuum patterns) using a multistate survival model. For each subgroup, we determined the CEEG duration for which the risk of ES was <5% and <2%.
ES occurred in 184 children (26%). Patients achieved <5% risk of ES after (1) 6 hours if ≥1 year without prior seizures or EEG risk factors; (2) 1 day if <1 year without prior seizures or EEG risks; (3) 1 day if ≥1 year with either prior seizures or EEG risks; (4) 2 days if ≥1 year with prior seizures and EEG risks; (5) 2 days if <1 year without prior seizures but with EEG risks; and (6) 2.5 days if <1 year with prior seizures regardless of the presence of EEG risks. Patients achieved <2% risk of ES at the same durations except patients without prior seizures or EEG risk factors would require longer CEEG (1.5 days if <1 year of age, 1 day if ≥1 year of age).
A model derived from 2 baseline clinical risk factors and emergent EEG risk factors would allow clinicians to implement personalized strategies that optimally target limited CEEG resources. This would enable more widespread use of CEEG-guided management as a potential neuroprotective strategy.

The periods of initiation and discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass could be high-risk periods. Certain frontal EEG patterns might plausibly occur with unintended intraoperative awareness. This study sought to quantify the incidence of these pre-specified patterns during cardiac surgery.
Two-channel bihemispheric frontal EEG was recorded in 1072 patients undergoing cardiac surgery as part of a prospective observational study. Spectrograms were created, and mean theta (4-7 Hz) power and peak alpha (7-17 Hz) frequency were measured in patients under general anaesthesia with isoflurane. Emergence-like EEG activity in the spectrogram during surgery was classified as an alpha peak frequency increase by 2 Hz or more, and a theta power decrease by 5 dB or more in comparison with the median pre-bypass values.
Data from 1002 patients were available for analysis. Fifty-five of those patients (5.5%) showed emergence-like EEG activity at least once during surgery with a median duration of 13.2 min. These patients were younger (median age, 59 vs 67 yr; P<0.001) and the median end-tidal isoflurane concentration before cardiopulmonary bypass was higher (0.82 vs 0.75 minimum alveolar concentration [MAC]; P=0.013). There was no significant difference between those with or without emergence-like EEG activity in sex, lowest core temperature, or duration of surgery. Forty-six of these EEG changes (84%) occurred within a 1 h time window centred on separation from cardiopulmonary bypass.
The findings of this study suggest that approximately one in 20 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a volatile anaesthetic agent have a sustained EEG pattern while surgery is ongoing that is often seen with emergence from general anaesthesia. Monitoring the frontal EEG during cardiopulmonary bypass may identify these events and potentially reduce the incidence of unintended awareness.

The best assessment of the depth of anesthesia is commonly thought to be the one made by the doctor in charge of the patient. This evaluation is based on the integration of several parameters including epidemiological, pharmacological and physiological data. By developing a protocol to record synchronously all these parameters we aim at having this evaluation made by an algorithm. Our hypothesis was that the standard parameters recorded during anesthesia (without EEG) could provide a good insight into the consciousness level of the patient. We developed a complete solution for high-resolution longitudinal follow-up of patients during anesthesia.

Patients undergoing general anesthesia for hernial inguinal repair were included after informed consent. The algorithm was tested on 30 patients. The percentage of error to identify the actual state among Awake, LOC, Anesthesia, ROC and Emergence was 18%.

We conducted a retrospective systematic study to describe the electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics in this disease, looking for specific patterns.
EEGs performed in patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between 25/03/2020 and 06/05/2020 in the University Hospital of Bicêtre were independently reviewed by two experienced neurologists. We used the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's terminology for the description of abnormal patterns. EEGs were classified into five categories, from normal to critically altered. Interobserver reliability was calculated using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Medical records were reviewed to extract demographics, clinical, imaging and biological data.
Forty EEGs were reviewed in 36 COVID-19 patients, 18 in intensive care units (ICU) and 22 in medicine units. The main indications were confusion or fluctuating alertness for 23 (57.5%) and delayed awakening after stopping sedation in ICU in six (15%). EEGs were normal to mildly altered in 23 (57.5%) contrary to the 42.5% where EEG alterations were moderate in four (10%), severe in eight (20%) and critical in five (12.5%). Generalized periodic discharges (GPDs), multifocal periodic discharges (MPDs) or rhythmic delta activity (RDA) were found in 13 recordings (32.5%). EEG alterations were not stereotyped or specific. They could be related to an underlying morbid status, except for three ICU patients with unexplained encephalopathic features.
In this first systematic analysis of COVID-19 patients who underwent EEG, over half of them presented a normal recording pattern. EEG alterations were not different from those encountered in other pathological conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32653111/

One hundred twenty patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery were randomly divided into four groups: group DP, group D, group P and group N. The blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (SPO2), EEG, bispectral index (BIS), Ramsay sedation score and state anxiety questionnaire (SAI) were recorded before administration (T0), 10 min (T1), 20 min (T2) and 30 min (T3) after administration. After 30 min, endotracheal intubation was performed after anesthesia induction. The BP, HR, SPO2 were recorded 1 min before intubation (T4), intubation (T5), 3 min (T6) after intubation, 5 min (T7) after intubation, and blood samples were collected from patients before administration and after intubation 2 min to detect serum cortisol (Cor), adrenalin (E) norepinephrine (NE) and blood glucose (BS).
There was no significant difference in Ramsay sedation score before anesthesia, but the Ramsay sedation score in group D、DP was significantly higher than that in group P and group N, the BIS, BP, HR and anxiety scores were significantly lower than those in the group P and group N (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in Ramsay sedation score, BIS value, anxiety score and BP, HR between group D and group DP (p > 0.05). Compared with T4, there was no significant difference in BIS and BP, HR in group D, group DP and group P (p > 0.05), but the BIS, BP and HR in group N were significantly higher than T4, (p < 0.05). Three minutes after intubation there was no statistical difference in the changes of Cor, E, NE and BS values compared with before intubation in group P and group DP (p > 0.05), but the changes of Cor, E, NE and BS values were significantly lower than that in group N (p < 0.05). Compared with T0, the values of NE, E, Cor, BS decreased in group D, DP and P at T4, group DP decreased more significantly than group D (p < 0.05). while the NE, E, Cor, BS of T6 are at the same level as the base value. In group N, the NE, E, Cor, BS of T4 were at the same level of T0, but significantly higher at T6.And at T6, NE and E in group D, P and N were significantly different from those in group DP (p < 0.05).
Preoperative intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine combined with parecoxib sodium by functional nasal endoscopy can not only calm and resist anxiety, but also better prevent stress response of endotracheal intubation, which is a safe and effective way of preoperative medication.

We considered as deep sedation the EEG burst-suppression patterns (suppression ratio > 50%). A GOSE (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended) score of 7 or 8 was considered as good prognosis. A comparative study was carried out to identify predictors of good or poor prognosis at discharge, at 1 and 2 years of follow-up.

Overall 118 right-handed children with BECTS were included from two medical centers. Of them, 29 patients were with diagnosed ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) at baseline, and the remaining were considered as typical BECTS. Clinical and EEG characteristics were collected at baseline and follow-up endpoint of one year. All the patients completed an eight-hour video-electroencephalogram (VEEG) without sedation at those two time points using a digital system with international 10-20 array electrode placement. At the follow-up endpoint, we also evaluated the intelligence level of all patients using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV). Multivariate logistical regression model was performed to assess the risk factors of ADHD in BECTS patients.
Compared with typical BECTS, patients with BECTS-ADHD had an earlier age of onset, a longer disease course and tended to have lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. Their epileptiform discharges were more likely to diffuse to one or both hemispheres, and a higher percentage of patients with BECTS-ADHD patients needed multitherapy to control seizures. Multivariate analysis showed that age of onset, disease course, intelligence score, number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and bilateral or diffusing discharges were independently associated with the occurrence of ADHD in patients with BECTS (p < .05). Additionally, we found that delayed diagnosis (37.3%) and nonadherence to treatment (16.1%) were the main reasons of a long disease course.
Benign partial epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes with ADHD has the characteristics of early age of onset, long course of disease and low intelligence score. In addition, the epileptiform discharges of BECTS-ADHD were prone to be bilateral or diffuse, and polypharmacological treatment is also common in this group.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32603807/

Over the past 10 years, this distinction has proven its diagnostic value as well as its important prognostic value on consciousness recovery. However, clinicians are currently limited by three factors: (i) the current behavioural repertoire of minimally conscious state items is limited and restricted to a few cognitive domains in the goldstandard revised version of the Coma Recovery Scale; (ii) a proportion of ∼15-20% clinically VS/UWS patients are actually in a richer state than VS/UWS as evidenced by functional brain imaging; and (iii) the neurophysiological and cognitive interpretation of each minimally conscious state item is still unclear and debated. In the current study we demonstrate that habituation of the auditory startle reflex (hASR) tested at bedside constitutes a novel, simple and powerful behavioural sign that can accurately distinguish minimally conscious state from VS/UWS. In addition to enlarging the minimally conscious state items repertoire, and therefore decreasing the low sensitivity of current behavioural measures, we also provide an original and rigorous description of the neurophysiological basis of hASR through a combination of functional (high density EEG and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging) and structural (diffusion tensor imaging MRI) measures. We show that preservation of hASR is associated with the functional and structural integrity of a brain-scale fronto-parietal network, including prefrontal regions related to control of action and inhibition, and meso-parietal areas associated with minimally conscious and conscious states. Lastly, we show that hASR predicts 6-month improvement of consciousness. Taken together, our results show that hASR is a cortically-mediated behaviour, and suggest that it could be a new clinical item to clearly and accurately identify non-communicating patients who are in the minimally conscious state.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32582938/

Indeed, brief exposures to burst-suppressing anesthesia has been reported to elicit antidepressant effects in a subset of patients, and produce behavioral and molecular alterations, such as increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), connected with antidepressant responses in rodents. Here, we have further tested the cerebral silence hypothesis by determining whether repeated exposures to isoflurane anesthesia reduce depressive-like symptoms or influence BDNF expression in male Wistar outbred rats (Crl:WI(Han)) subjected to chronic mild stress (CMS), a model which is responsive to repeated electroconvulsive shocks (ECS, a model of ECT). Stress-susceptible, stress-resilient, and unstressed rats were exposed to 5 doses of isoflurane over a 15-day time period, with administrations occurring every third day. Isoflurane dosing is known to reliably produce rapid EEG burst-suppression (4% induction, 2% maintenance; 15 min). Antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of isoflurane were assessed after the first, third, and fifth drug exposure by measuring sucrose consumption, as well as performance on the open field and the elevated plus maze tasks. Tissue samples from the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were collected, and levels of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) protein were assessed. We find that isoflurane anesthesia had no impact on the behavior of stress-resilient or anhedonic rats in selected tests; findings which were consistent-perhaps inherently related-with unchanged levels of BDNF.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32579566/

Here, we noted frequency increases in δ-waves in sleep-deprived mice, prompting us to re-evaluate how slow-wave characteristics relate to prior sleep-wake history. We identified two classes of δ-waves; one responding to sleep deprivation with high initial power and fast, discontinuous decay during recovery sleep (δ2) and another unrelated to time-spent-awake with slow, linear decay (δ1). Reanalysis of previously published datasets demonstrates that δ-band heterogeneity after sleep deprivation is also present in human subjects. Similar to sleep deprivation, silencing of centromedial thalamus neurons boosted subsequent δ2-waves, specifically. δ2-dynamics paralleled that of temperature, muscle tone, heart rate, and neuronal ON-/OFF-state lengths, all reverting to characteristic NREMS levels within the first recovery hour.

Recently, ketamine has also been proposed as a novel treatment for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Beyond its anaesthetic actions, however, the effects of ketamine on brain activity have rarely been probed. Here we examined the cortical electroencephalography (EEG) response to ketamine of 12 sheep. Following ketamine administration, EEG changes were immediate and widespread, affecting the full extent of the EEG frequency spectrum measured (0-125 Hz). After recovery from sedation during which low frequency activity dominated, the EEG was characterised by short periods (2-3 s) of alternating low (<14 Hz) and high (>35 Hz) frequency oscillation. This alternating EEG rhythm phase is likely to underlie the dissociative actions of ketamine, since it is during this phase that ketamine users report hallucinations. At the highest intravenous dose used (24 mg/kg), in 5/6 sheep we observed a novel effect of ketamine, namely the complete cessation of cortical EEG activity. This persisted for up to several minutes, after which cortical activity resumed. This phenomenon is likely to explain the 'k-hole', a state of oblivion likened to a near death experience that is keenly sought by ketamine abusers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32528071/

In this retrospective study, we reviewed the records of 89 children who presented for Magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (EEG) scans between August of 2008 and May of 2015. Data analyzed included demographics and the frequency of epileptic spikes. Sedated magnetoencephalography recordings were compared to nonsedated video-electroencephalography (vEEG) recordings in the same patients to determine the impact of dexmedetomidine.
Spike frequency between magnetoencephalography with sedation and video-electroencephalography without sedation was compared in 85 patients. Magnetoencephalography and video-electroencephalography were considered clinically concordant in 80 patients (94.1%) and discordant in 5 patients (5.9%), all with less spikes during Magnetoencephalography. The median (range) bolus dose of dexmedetomidine was 2 (1-2) mcg/kg. The median (range) infusion rate of dexmedetomidine was 2 (0.5-4) mcg/kg/h. All patients experienced reductions in heart rate after administration of dexmedetomidine; these reductions were statistically, but not clinically, significant.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a specific condition, whose distinctive features are severe hypoxemia associated with (>50% of cases) normal respiratory system compliance. When a patient requires intubation and invasive ventilation, the outcome is poor, and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) is usually 2 or 3 weeks. In this article, the authors review several technological devices, which could support health care providers at the bedside to optimize the care for COVID-19 patients who are sedated, paralyzed, and ventilated. Particular attention is provided to the use of videolaryngoscopes (VL) because these can assist anesthetists to perform a successful intubation outside the ICU while protecting health care providers from this viral infection. Authors will also review processed electroencephalographic (EEG) monitors which are used to better titrate sedation and the train-of-four monitors which are utilized to better administer neuromuscular blocking agents in the view of sparing limited pharmacological resources. COVID-19 can rapidly exhaust human and technological resources too within the ICU. This review features a series of technological advancements that can significantly improve the care of patients requiring isolation. The working conditions in isolation could cause gaps or barriers in communication, fatigue, and poor documentation of provided care. The available technology has several advantages including (a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all health care givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; (b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point-of-care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; (c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) and thromboelastography (TEG); (d) adapting the use of anesthetic machines and the use of volatile anesthetics.

A key research task is to understand how these two theories relate to one another, and particularly, how the brain transitions from a predictive early state to the eventual engagement of a brain-scale state (the GW). To address this question, we present a source-localization of EEG responses evoked by the local-global task-an experimental paradigm that engages a predictive hierarchy, which encompasses the GW. The results of our source reconstruction suggest three phases of processing. The first phase involves the sensory (here auditory) regions of the superior temporal lobe and predicts sensory regularities over a short timeframe (as per the local effect). The third phase is brain-scale, involving inferior frontal, as well as inferior and superior parietal regions, consistent with a global neuronal workspace (GNW; as per the global effect). Crucially, our analysis suggests that there is an intermediate (second) phase, involving modulatory interactions between inferior frontal and superior temporal regions. Furthermore, sedation with propofol reduces modulatory interactions in the second phase. This selective effect is consistent with a PC explanation of sedation, with propofol acting on descending predictions of the precision of prediction errors; thereby constraining access to the GNW.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32427284/

This was a phase 2, open-label, randomized, active-control, proof-of-concept trial (EP0087; NCT03021018). Patients (18-70 years) admitted to EMU were randomized 1:1:1 to single-dose bolus IV LZP (dose per investigator's practice), IV BRV 100 mg, or IV BRV 200 mg. Trial medication had to be administered within 30 min of qualifying seizure. Primary efficacy outcome was time to next seizure (clinical observation with electroencephalogram [EEG] confirmation) or to rescue medication use within 12 h of trial medication administration. Secondary outcomes included seizure freedom and rescue medication use within 12 h of trial medication administration. Safety and tolerability outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).
Overall, 46 patients were randomized, and 45 received trial medication for a qualifying seizure. Patients in the LZP arm had doses from 1 to 4 mg (median: 1 mg). Eleven of 45 patients had a seizure within 12 h of trial medication administration (LZP 5/15 [median time to next seizure: 5.55 h], BRV 100 mg 3/15 [5.97 h], BRV 200 mg 3/15 [3.60 h]).

Most common TEAEs (≥10% of patients) were sedation and somnolence with LZP, and dizziness, headache, and nausea with BRV.
Intravenous LZP, IV BRV 100 mg, and IV BRV 200 mg showed similar efficacy in controlling acute seizure activity in the EMU. Treatment-emergent adverse events were as expected for each medication.

Specifically, it is unclear whether anesthesia primarily disrupts thalamocortical relay or intercortical signaling. Here we recorded intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG), local field potentials (LFPs), and single-unit activity in patients during wakefulness and light anesthesia. Propofol infusion was gradually increased while auditory stimuli were presented and patients responded to a target stimulus until they became unresponsive. We found widespread iEEG responses in association cortices during wakefulness, which were attenuated and restricted to auditory regions upon LOC. Neuronal spiking and LFP responses in primary auditory cortex (PAC) persisted after LOC, while responses in higher-order auditory regions were variable, with neuronal spiking largely attenuated. Gamma power induced by word stimuli increased after LOC while its frequency profile slowed, thus differing from local spiking activity. In summary, anesthesia-induced LOC disrupts auditory processing in association cortices while relatively sparing responses in PAC, opening new avenues for future research into mechanisms of LOC and the design of anesthetic monitoring devices.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32398367/

Burst-suppression (odds ratio, 4.1 [1.5 to 13.7]; P = 0.012) and age (odds ratio, 1.07 [0.99 to 1.15]; P = 0.090) were retained as predictors in the delirium multivariable model. Delirium was associated with decreased electroencephalogram power from 6.8 to 24.4 Hertz.
The inference from the present study is that CPB burst-suppression mediates the effects of physical function, lowest CPB temperature, and electroencephalogram alpha power on delirium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32349072/

This open, prospective study recruited the patients with epilepsy attending the Clinic of Neurology at the University Hospital of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The patients completed diaries about the seizure frequency, severity, and adverse events. There were regular documented visits at 3 or 6 months during the first year of treatment with TGB and at 6 months or 1 year afterwards, with dynamic assessment of seizure frequency, severity, adverse events, and EEG recordings. TGB was applied as an add-on treatment in 43 patients (24 males, mean age 39 years). There was relatively mild and transient dynamic improvement of seizure severity, satisfactory seizure frequency reduction in 32.6% of participants, stable mean seizure frequency reduction (40-50%) from month 6 to month 24 and a stable response rate (52.3-50%) during the same period. New seizure types (myoclonic, myoclonic-atonic) occurred in 2 patients. The final clinical efficacy was higher in patients with initial monotherapy. There were adverse events (dizziness/vertigo, sedation, memory impairment, loss of appetite and weight, confusion, psychosis, insomnia, transient diplopia, lymphadenomegaly, rash, nausea, depression, anxiety, tremor of hands, unstable gait, legs edema, thrombocytopenia, cervical muscles tightening) in 26.19% of patients. In conclusion, TGB treatment is associated with low and transient improvement of seizure severity, good and stable improvement of seizure frequency, possible worsening of seizure control, possible appearance of new seizure types, and acceptable safety and tolerability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32337898/

How the basal ganglia contribute to the loss and recovery of consciousness during anaesthesia has, however, not yet been well characterised.
Twelve patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, who were undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode implantation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), were included in this study. Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the DBS electrodes and EEG was recorded from the scalp during induction of general anaesthesia (with propofol and sufentanil) and during tracheal intubation. Neural signatures of loss of consciousness and of the expected arousal during intubation were sought in the STN and EEG recordings.
Propofol-sufentanil anaesthesia resulted in power increases in delta, theta, and alpha frequencies, and broadband power decreases in higher frequencies in both STN and frontal cortical areas. This was accompanied by increased STN-frontal cortical coherence only in the alpha frequency band (119 [68]%; P=0.0049). We observed temporal activity changes in STN after tracheal intubation, including power increases in high-beta (22-40 Hz) frequency (98 [123]%; P=0.0064) and changes in the power-law exponent in the power spectra at lower frequencies (2-80 Hz), which were not observed in the frontal cortex. During anaesthesia, the dynamic changes in the high-gamma power in STN LFPs correlated with the power-law exponent in the power spectra at lower frequencies (2-80 Hz).
Apart from similar activity changes in both STN and cortex associated with anaesthesia-induced unresponsiveness, we observed specific neuronal activity changes in the STN in response to the anaesthesia and tracheal intubation. We also show that the power-law exponent in the power spectra in the STN was modulated by tracheal intubation in anaesthesia. Our results support the hypothesis that subcortical nuclei may play an important role in the loss and return of responsiveness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32336475/

This retrospective study investigated the differences in the depth of anesthesia through EEG analysis between propofol- and thiopental-induced anesthesia. We reviewed data of 42 patients undergoing cesarean section who received either thiopental (5 mg/kg) or propofol (2 mg/kg). EEG data were extracted from the bispectral index (BIS) monitor, and 10-second segments were selected from the following sections: 1) Stage I, BIS below 60 after induction; 2) Stage II, after intubation completion; 3) Stage III, end-tidal sevoflurane above 0 vol%. The risk of awareness was represented by the BIS and entropy measures. In Stage III, the thiopental group (n = 20) showed significantly higher BIS value than the propofol group (n = 22) (67.9 [18.66] vs 44.5 [20.63], respectively, p = 0.002). The thiopental group had decreased slow-delta oscillations and increased beta-oscillations as compared to the propofol group in Stages II and III (p < 0.05). BIS, spectral entropy, and Renyi permutation entropy were also higher in the thiopental group at Stages II and III (p < 0.05).

Only a few studies reported NGF administration in pediatric patients with impaired brain functions after traumatic injuries, ischemic or infectious diseases, such as meningitis. We described the beneficial therapeutic effects of human-recombinant nerve growth factor (hr-NGF) treatment in an infant with persistent unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), due to late-onset group B Streptococcus meningitis. The infant received five monthly cycles of intranasal hr-NGF (0.1 mg/kg, 3 times daily for 7 consecutive days) through a mucosal atomizer device (MAD). NGF administration improved functional [positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), single-photon emission/computed tomography (SPECT/CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] assessments, electrophysiological [Electroencephalogram (EEG)] studies, as well as main cognitive processes and clinical and neurological functions. After hr-NGF treatment, significant improvements in facial mimicry, attention, motor reactions, oral motility, and feeding capacity were observed. She also recovered some hypothalamic functions and her cough reflex was restored. No side effects were reported during and after the treatment. For the first time ever, hr-NGF has been successfully utilized in an infant with UWS and severe neurologic outcome due to a bacterial meningitis. Although further studies are needed for better understanding the neuroprotective role of this neurotrophin, intranasal hr-NGF administration appears to be a promising and save rescuing strategy treatment in infants with severe neurological impairment after brain damage.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32274529/

Previous studies have suggested that excessive general anesthesia may lead to postoperative delirium. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based monitors have been administered in clinical practice in an attempt to deliver appropriate anesthesia. The aim of this updated meta-analysis was to evaluate the current body of research concerning the effects of EEG-based monitor on postoperative delirium.
We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of the effect of processed EEG monitor on postoperative delirium as the primary outcome. The search was performed in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, with no language restrictions from inception until June 23, 2019. Two independent reviewers screened records and full-text articles for inclusion. Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment were conducted by 3 independent reviewers. Random-effects models were used to calculate combined-effect estimates. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of evidence.
Of 5904 records screened, 5 studies met our inclusion criteria, including 3612 patients. Meta-analysis revealed no significant effect of EEG-based monitors on postoperative delirium (risk ratio [RR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-1.05; I = 73%). The results showed a statistically significant reduction in intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (3 studies, weight mean difference [WMD] -0.29 days; 95% CI, -0.53 to -0.05) in patients with EEG monitored. EEG-guided anesthesia did not have a statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality (3 studies, RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.31-1.29) and hospital length of stay (4 studies, WMD -0.61 days; 95% CI, -1.34 to 0.11). Few studies investigated the effects of EEG-guided anesthesia on perioperative major nonneurological complications and did not come up with promising results.

This study aimed to examine the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of intranasal midazolam (in-MDZ) spray in clinical practice.
In this retrospective, multicenter observational study, we evaluated all patients with peri-ictal application of in-MDZ during video-EEG monitoring at the epilepsy centers in Frankfurt and Marburg between 2 014 and 2017. For every patient, we analyzed the recurrence of any seizure or generalized tonic-clonic seizures after index seizures with and without in-MDZ administration. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were also evaluated.
In-MDZ was used in 243 patients with epilepsy (mean age 35.5 years; range 5-76 years; 46.5% female) for treatment of 459 seizures. A median dose of in-MDZ 5 mg (i.e., two puffs; range 2.5-15 mg) was administered within a median time from EEG seizure onset until in-MDZ application of 1.18 min [interquartile range (IQR) 1.27], while median time from clinical seizure onset until in-MDZ administration was 1.08 min (IQR 1.19). In-MDZ was given within 1 min after EEG seizure onset in 171 seizures. An intraindividual comparison of seizures with and without application of in-MDZ was feasible in 171 patients, demonstrating that in-MDZ reduced the occurrence of any (Cox proportional-hazard model p < 0.001) and generalized tonic-clonic seizure (Cox proportional-hazard model p = 0.0167) over a period of 24 h. The seizure-free timespan was doubled from a median of 5.0 h in controls to a median of 10.67 h after in-MDZ administration. We additionally clustered in-MDZ administrations for the 119 patients who received in-MDZ more than once, comparing them with the index cases without in-MDZ. Even when considering subsequent seizures with in-MDZ administration, a patient receiving in-MDZ is still half as likely to incur another seizure in the upcoming 24 h as compared with when the same patient does not receive in-MDZ (hazard ratio 0.50; 95% CI 0.42-0.60; p < 0.01). In-MDZ was well tolerated without major adverse events. The most common side effects were irritation of the nasal mucosa [37 cases (8.1%)], prolonged sedation [26 cases (5.7%)], and nausea and vomiting [12 cases (2.6%)]. A decline in oxygen saturation was measured after 78 seizures (17%).
We conclude that in-MDZ is a safe and efficient treatment option to prevent short-term recurrence of seizures. In-MDZ can be administered very quickly by trained staff within 1-2 min after seizure onset. No major cardiocirculatory or respiratory adverse events were observed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32219682/

We present a series of seven cases of awareness that were identified from provider-reported adverse event data from the electronic anesthesia records of 647,000 general anesthetics.
The low number of identified cases suggests an under-reporting bias. Themes that emerge from this small series can serve as important reminders to anesthesia providers to ensure delivery of an adequate anesthetic for each patient. Commonalities between a majority of our identified anesthetic awareness cases include: obesity, use of total intravenous anesthesia, use of neuromuscular blockade, and either a lack of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring or documented high depth of consciousness index values. An interesting phenomenon was observed in one case, where adequately-dosed anesthesia was delivered without technical issue, processed EEG monitoring was employed, and the index value suggested an adequate depth of consciousness throughout the case.
Provider-reported adverse event data in the immediate post-operative period are likely insensitive for detecting cases of intraoperative awareness.

In this prospective cohort study including 600 patients, AD during stable anesthesia was assessed by clinical judgement of the attending, EEG-blinded anesthesiologist (using a scale staging the AD as mid-adequate, adequate but fairly deep, or adequate but fairly light) and by simultaneously recorded Narcotrend measurements.
In 42% of patients (n = 250), the anesthesiologist's clinical judgement was in agreement with anesthetic levels as measured by the Narcotrend monitor. In 46% of patients (n = 274), the anesthesiologist's judgement and the Narcotrend monitor differed by one AD level (minor discordance). Major discordance was observed in 76 (13%) measurements (judged deeper than measured, n = 29 [5%]; judged lighter than measured, n = 47 [8%]). In 7% of patients (n = 44), the Narcotrend index was outside the limits of adequate AD (too deep, n = 28 [5%]; too superficial, n = 16 [3%]). The overall level of agreement between the anesthesiologist's judgement and the Narcotrend monitor was not statistically significant (Cohen's kappa, -0.039; P = 0.17). Using a random forests algorithm, age, mean blood pressure, the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, body mass index, and frailty were the variables with the highest relative feature importance to predict the level of agreement.
These results suggest that clinical judgement of AD during stable anesthesia was not in agreement with EEG-based assessment of anesthetic depth in 58% of cases. Nevertheless, this finding could be influenced by the lack of validated scales to clinically judge AD.

RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: Notre objectif était de comparer le jugement clinique d’anesthésiologistes n’ayant pas accès à un électroencéphalogramme (EEG) à une mesure de la profondeur anesthésique (PA) fondée sur l’EEG utilisant le moniteur Narcotrend®. MéTHODE: Dans cette étude de cohorte prospective de 600 patients, la PA a été évaluée pendant la phase de maintien stable de l’anesthésie selon le jugement clinique de l’anesthésiologiste traitant, qui n’avait pas accès à l’EEG (sur une échelle évaluant la PA comme étant adéquate, adéquate mais relativement profonde ou adéquate mais relativement légère) et par des mesures simultanément enregistrées par le Narcotrend. RéSULTATS: Chez 42 % des patients (n = 250), le jugement clinique de l’anesthésiologiste concordait aux niveaux anesthésiques tels que mesurés par le moniteur Narcotrend. Chez 46 % des patients (n = 274), le jugement de l’anesthésiologiste et le moniteur Narcotrend différaient d’un niveau de PA (discordance mineure). Une discordance majeure a été observée dans 76 (13 %) mesures (jugées plus profondes que mesurées, n = 29 [5 %], jugées plus légères que mesurées, n = 47 [8 %]). Chez 7 % des patients (n = 44), l’indice Narcotrend était situé au-delà des limites d’une PA adéquate (trop profond, n = 28 [5 %]; trop superficiel, n = 16 [3 %]). Le niveau global de concordance entre le jugement de l’anesthésiologiste et le moniteur Narcotrend n’était pas significatif d’un point de vue statistique (kappa de Cohen, -0,039; P = 0,17). En se fondant sur un algorithme de forêt d’arbres décisionnels (random forests algorithm), l’âge, la tension artérielle moyenne, la classification selon l’American Society of Anesthesiologists, l’indice de masse corporelle et l’index de fragilité ont été identifiés comme les variables ayant la plus grande importance relative pour prédire le niveau de concordance. CONCLUSION: Ces résultats suggèrent que, dans 58 % des cas, le jugement clinique de la PA ne concordait pas à l’évaluation par EEG de la profondeur anesthésique pendant une phase de maintien stable de l’anesthésie. Toutefois, ces résultats pourraient être influencés par l’absence d’échelles validées pour juger la PA d’un point de vue clinique.

Specifically, spectral EEG power is lower in elderly, compared to younger, subjects. Here, the authors investigate age-related changes in EEG architecture in patients undergoing general anesthesia through a detailed examination of spectral and entropic measures.
The authors retrospectively studied 180 frontal EEG recordings from patients undergoing general anesthesia, induced with propofol/fentanyl and maintained by sevoflurane at the Waikato Hospital in Hamilton, New Zealand. The authors calculated power spectral density and normalized power spectral density, the entropic measures approximate and permutation entropy, as well as the beta ratio and spectral entropy as exemplary parameters used in current monitoring systems from segments of EEG obtained before the onset of surgery (i.e., with no noxious stimulation).
The oldest quartile of patients had significantly lower 1/f characteristics (P < 0.001; area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.84 [0.76 0.92]), indicative of a more uniform distribution of spectral power. Analysis of the normalized power spectral density revealed no significant impact of age on relative alpha (P = 0.693; area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.52 [0.41 0.63]) and a significant but weak effect on relative beta power (P = 0.041; area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.62 [0.52 0.73]). Using entropic parameters, the authors found a significant age-related change toward a more irregular and unpredictable EEG (permutation entropy: P < 0.001, area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.81 [0.71 0.90]; approximate entropy: P < 0.001; area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.76 [0.66 0.85]). With approximate entropy, the authors could also detect an age-induced change in alpha-band activity (P = 0.002; area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.69 [0.60 78]).
Like the sleep literature, spectral and entropic EEG features under general anesthesia change with age revealing a shift toward a faster, more irregular, oscillatory composition of the EEG in older patients. Age-related changes in neurophysiological activity may underlie these findings however the contribution of age-related changes in filtering properties or the signal to noise ratio must also be considered. Regardless, most current EEG technology used to guide anesthetic management focus on spectral features, and improvements to these devices might involve integration of entropic features of the raw EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32108685/

32077099,Development of a model to predict electroencephalographic seizures in critically ill children.,Epilepsia,2020,"Fung FW, Jacobwitz M, Parikh DS, Vala L, Donnelly M, Fan J, Xiao R, Topjian AA, Abend NS","Electroencephalographic seizures (ESs) are common in encephalopathic critically ill children, but ES identification with continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring (CEEG) is resource-intense. We aimed to develop an ES prediction model that would enable clinicians to stratify patients by ES risk and optimally target limited CEEG resources. We aimed to determine whether incorporating data from a screening EEG yielded better performance characteristics than models using clinical variables alone.
We performed a prospective observational study of 719 consecutive critically ill children with acute encephalopathy undergoing CEEG in the pediatric intensive care unit of a quaternary care institution between April 2017 and February 2019. We identified clinical and EEG risk factors for ES. We evaluated model performance with area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), validated the optimal model with the highest AUC using a fivefold cross-validation, and calculated test characteristics emphasizing high sensitivity. We applied the optimal operating slope strategy to identify the optimal cutoff to define whether a patient should undergo CEEG.
The incidence of ES was 26%. Variables associated with increased ES risk included age, acute encephalopathy category, clinical seizures prior to CEEG initiation, EEG background, and epileptiform discharges. Combining clinical and EEG variables yielded better model performance (AUC 0.80) than clinical variables alone (AUC 0.69; P < .01). At a 0.10 cutoff selected to emphasize sensitivity, the optimal model had a sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 37%, positive predictive value of 34%, and negative predictive value of 93%. If applied, the model would limit 29% of patients from undergoing CEEG while failing to identify 8% of patients with ES.
A model employing readily available clinical and EEG variables could target limited CEEG resources to critically ill children at highest risk for ES, making CEEG-guided management a more viable neuroprotective strategy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32077099/
32055976,Minimizing blood loss in hemispherectomy for hemimegalencephaly in low-weight infants: technical note.,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,2020,"Sood S, Asano E, Luat A","Drug-resistant seizures due to hemimegalencephaly in neonates and infants are a unique surgical and anesthesia challenge. While early surgery in these patients may predict a better seizure control, a lower body weight, limited blood volume, and surgical blood loss may make hemispherectomy prohibitive.
Two infants (weight, 8.7 kg and 3.7 kg) underwent interhemispheric vertical hemispherotomy with endoscope assistance. In the first case, during the lateral disconnection, excessive bleeding prompted the surgeon to coagulate the lenticulostriate arteries at the origin from the middle cerebral artery to reduce bleeding. In the second infant, the lenticulostriate arteries were coagulated before initiating the lateral disconnection.
In both infants, the blood loss from lateral dissection was reduced by coagulation of lenticulostriate arteries.
The authors suggest that early coagulation of the lenticulostriate arteries is a useful strategy to minimize blood loss in low-weight infants undergoing hemispherotomy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32055976/
32047246,Analysis of brain connectivity during nitrous oxide sedation using graph theory.,Scientific reports,2020,"Lee JM, Kim PJ, Kim HG, Hyun HK, Kim YJ, Kim JW, Shin TJ","Nitrous oxide, the least potent inhalation anesthetic, is widely used for conscious sedation. Recently, it has been reported that the occurrence of anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness decreases the interconnection between brain regions, resulting in brain network changes. However, few studies have investigated these changes in conscious sedation using nitrous oxide. Therefore, the present study aimed to use graph theory to analyze changes in brain networks during nitrous oxide sedation. Participants were 20 healthy volunteers (10 men and 10 women, 20-40 years old) with no history of systemic disease. We acquired electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of 32 channels during baseline, nitrous oxide inhalation sedation, and recovery. EEG epochs from the baseline and the sedation state (50% nitrous oxide) were extracted and analyzed with the network connection parameters of graph theory. Analysis of 1/f dynamics, revealed a steeper slope while in the sedation state than during the baseline. Network connectivity parameters showed significant differences between the baseline and sedation state, in delta, alpha1, alpha2, and beta2 frequency bands. The most pronounced differences in functional distance during nitrous oxide sedation were observed in the alpha1 and alpha2 frequency bands. Change in 1/f dynamics indicates that changes in brain network systems occur during nitrous oxide administration. Changes in network parameters imply that nitrous oxide interferes with the efficiency of information integration in the frequency bands important for cognitive processes and attention tasks. Alteration of brain network during nitrous oxide administration may be associated to the sedative mechanism of nitrous oxide.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32047246/
32040794,Time delay of the qCON monitor and its performance during state transitions.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2021,"Zanner R, Schneider G, Meyer A, Kochs E, Kreuzer M","We investigated the performance of the qCON index regarding its time delay for sudden changes in the anesthetic level as well as to separate responsiveness from unresponsiveness during loss and return of responsiveness (LOR and ROR). For evaluation of the time delay, we replayed relevant EEG episodes to the qCON to simulate sudden changes between the states (i) awake/sedation, (ii) adequate anesthesia, or (iii) suppression. We also replayed EEG from 40 patients during LOR and ROR to evaluate the qCON's ability to separate responsiveness from unresponsiveness. The time delays depended on the type of transition. The delays for the important transition between awake/sedation and adequate anesthesia were 21(5) s from awake/sedation to adequate anesthesia and 26(5) s in the other direction. The performance of the qCON to separate responsiveness from unresponsiveness depended on signal quality, the investigation window, i.e. ± 30 s or ± 60 s around LOR/ROR, and the specific transition being tested. AUC was 0.63-0.90 for LOR and 0.61-0.79 for ROR. Time delay and performance during state transitions of the qCON were similar to other monitoring systems such as bispectral index. The better performance of qCON during LOR than ROR probably reflects the sudden change in EEG activity during LOR and the more heterogeneous EEG during ROR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32040794/

Veno-arterial femoro-femoral extracorporeal life support (VA-ECLS) and hemoperfusion (HP) were used as rescue treatments. The emergency medical service found a woman at home unconscious. Once in the hospital, she was intubated and catecholamines support was immediately started for a severe shock. Brain CT was normal, whereas EEG revealed a metabolic encephalopathy pattern. Toxic levels of Tramadol and Quetiapine were detected. VA-ECLS was implanted due to persistent multiorgan failure, and HP with a charcoal cartridge was set to increase the Tramadol clearance. To quantify the charcoal cartridge's removal efficiency of Tramadol, Tramadol concentration was measured before and after the cartridge and before and after the treatment in the patient's blood. The charcoal cartridge showed good extraction ratio during the treatment and no significant rebound effect. VA-ECLS and HP allowed the patient to be weaned from vasoconstrictors and the resolution of the organ failures.

Electroencephalographic Density Spectral Array monitoring facilitates the interpretation of unprocessed electroencephalogram data, providing the anesthesiologist with real-time drug-specific information on hypnotic depth. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the clinical applicability of Density Spectral Array with a commercially available monitor as the Narcotrend EEG monitor in teenagers under procedural sedation using propofol.
We performed a secondary analysis of EEG data. Unprocessed electroencephalogram data from 37 patients, aged 12-18 years, scheduled for gastrointestinal endoscopy under propofol sedation, were used for analysis. The relationship between non-steady state propofol concentrations and Density Spectral Array, represented by the four electroencephalographic frequency bands β, α, θ and δ was investigated.
Increasing propofol concentration caused augmentation in the amplitude of frontal δ oscillations and a decrease in the amplitude of frontal β oscillations. The expression of α oscillations showed a biphasic pattern related to increasing the propofol concentration. Spearman correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between propofol concentration and relative EEG power in β (r -0.84, P<0.0001), θ (r 0.50, P=0.004) and δ (r 0.63, P<0.0001).

However, most of the DoA monitors do not include brain activity signal modeling. Here, we propose a new algorithm termed the cortical activity index (CAI) based on the brain activity signals. In this study, we enrolled 32 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Raw electroencephalography (EEG) signals were acquired at a sampling rate of 128 Hz using BIS-VISTA with standard bispectral index (BIS) sensors. All data were stored on a computer for further analysis. The similarities and difference among spectral entropy, the BIS, and CAI were analyzed. Pearson correlation coefficient between the BIS and CAI was 0.825. The result of fitting the semiparametric regression models is the method CAI estimate (-0.00995; P = .0341). It is the estimated difference in the mean of the dependent variable between method BIS and CAI. The CAI algorithm, a simple and intuitive algorithm based on brain activity signal modeling, suggests an intrinsic relationship between the DoA and the EEG waveform.

This study aimed to investigate the electroencephalogram (EEG) pharmacodynamics of remimazolam infusion.
Twenty healthy male volunteers received remimazolam as continuous IV infusion of 5 mg/min for 5 min, 3 mg/min for the next 15 min, and 1 mg/min for further 15 min. Continuous EEG monitoring was performed by a neurophysiologic system with electrodes placed at F3, F4, C3, C4, O1, O2, Cz, and Fp1 (10/20 system) and using the Narcotrend Index. Sedation was assessed clinically by using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation scale. Pharmacodynamic models were developed for selected EEG variables and Narcotrend Index.
EEG changes during remimazolam infusion were characterized by an initial increase in beta frequency band and a late increase in delta frequency band. The EEG beta ratio showed a prediction probability of Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score of 0.79, and could be modeled successfully using a standard sigmoid Emax model. Narcotrend Index showed a prediction probability of Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score of 0.74. The time course of Narcotrend Index was described by an extended sigmoid Emax model with two sigmoid terms and different plasma-effect equilibration times.
Beta ratio was identified as a suitable EEG variable for monitoring remimazolam sedation. Narcotrend Index appeared less suitable than the beta ratio for monitoring the sedative effect if remimazolam is administered alone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31972657/

With the help of Electroencephalography (EEG), the human brain electric activity can be noninvasively measured at high temporal resolution. Several typical quasi-stable states are introduced to represent the oscillation of the global scalp electric field. These so-called microstates reflect spatiotemporal dynamics of coherent neural activities and capture the switch of brain states within the millisecond range. In this study, the microstates of high-density EEG were extracted and investigated during propofol-induced transition of consciousness. To analyze microstates on the frequency domain, a novel microstate-wise spectral analysis was proposed by the means of multivariate empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert-Huang transform. During the transition of consciousness, a map with a posterior central maximum denoted as microstate F appeared and became salient. The current results indicated that the coverage, occurrence, and power of microstate F significantly increased in moderate sedation. The results also demonstrated that the transition of brain state from rest to sedation was accompanied by significant increase in mean energy of all frequency bands in microstate F. Combined with studies on the possible cortical sources of microstates, the findings reveal that non-canonical microstate F is highly associated with propofol-induced altered states of consciousness. The results may also support the inference that this distinct topography can be derived from canonical microstate C (anterior-posterior orientation). Finally, this study further develops pertinent methodology and extends possible applications of the EEG microstate during propofol-induced anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31969080/

However, their performance for detecting the fluctuation of consciousness level remains unclear. In this work, we recorded 60-channels EEG data during propofol anesthesia, and extracted 110 EEG features that were shown to be sensitive to the change of consciousness level. Then, we used classification model to evaluate the performance of these features in distinguishing the response state fluctuating around the point of loss of behavioral responsiveness (LOBR) to external stimuli. We found that EEG features, including delta power, SynchFastSlow, and the topographical ratio of alpha power, were efficient in distinguishing the stable change in consciousness level with an accuracy of 95.8%, however, these features performed poorly in distinguishing the response state around the point of LOBR with an accuracy of 66.9%. Using EEG features selected specifically for detecting consciousness fluctuation, approximately 10% improvement in accuracy was obtained.

However, there is still no systematic framework for quantifying altered consciousness along the dimensions of both level and content. This study builds a framework to differentiate the following states: coma, general anesthesia, minimally conscious state (MCS), and normal wakefulness.
This study analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from frontal channels in patients with disorders of consciousness (either coma or MCS), patients under general anesthesia, and healthy participants in normal waking consciousness (NWC). Four non-linear methods-permutation entropy (PE), sample entropy (SampEn), permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC), and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)-as well as relative power (RP), extracted features from the EEG recordings. A genetic algorithm-based support vector machine (GA-SVM) classified the states of consciousness based on the extracted features. A multivariable linear regression model then built EEG indices for level and content of consciousness.
The PE differentiated all four states of consciousness (p<0.001). Altered contents of consciousness for NWC, MCS, coma, and general anesthesia were best differentiated by the SampEn, and PLZC. In contrast, the levels of consciousness for these four states were best differentiated by RP of Gamma and PE. A multi-dimensional index, combined with the GA-SVM, showed that the integration of PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA had the highest classification accuracy (92.3%). The GA-SVM was better than random forest and neural networks at differentiating these four states. The 'coordinate value' in the dimensions of level and content were constructed by the multivariable linear regression model and the non-linear measures PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA.

This variable may represent an indirect measure of anaesthetic concentration at the time of stimulation, and therefore may influence the quality of seizures induced.
To examine the impact of the anaesthetic to ECT stimulus time interval, and ventilation rate pre-treatment, on ictal seizure quality.
In a prospective, crossover trial, 54 depressed participants were randomised to variations in anaesthetic technique at four sequential ECT treatment sessions, in a 2 x 2 design: randomisation to a short or long anaesthetic-ECT time interval, and randomisation to normal ventilation or hyperventilation during anaesthetic induction with thiopentone. Ictal EEG data were collected at each study session and assessed by a blinded rater for ictal quality (seizure amplitude, regularity, post-ictal suppression and general seizure quality), using a quantitative-qualitative structured rating scale. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyse the effect of the anaesthetic-ECT time interval, and that of ventilation rate, on seizure quality indices.
The anaesthetic-ECT time interval had a significant impact on ictal EEG quality indices (p < 0.01), with longer time intervals producing higher quality seizures. Ventilation rate did not significantly influence quality measures.
The time between anaesthetic induction and ECT stimulus administration has a significant impact on ictal EEG seizure quality. Conversely, manipulations of ventilation rate did not significantly affect seizure quality.

This was a substudy of a trial testing the hypothesis that EEG-guided anesthesia prevents postoperative delirium. The intervention was a 35-minute training session, summarizing typical EEG changes with volatile-based anesthesia. Participants completed a preeducational test, underwent training, and completed a posteducational test. For each question, participants indicated whether the EEG was consistent with (1) wakefulness, (2) non-slow-wave anesthesia, (3) slow-wave anesthesia, or (4) burst suppression. They also indicated whether the processed EEG (pEEG) index was discordant with the EEG waveforms. Four clinicians, experienced in intraoperative EEG interpretation, independently evaluated the EEG waveforms, resolved disagreements, and provided reference answers. Ten questions were assessed in the preeducational test and 9 in the posteducational test.

The experience of EEG was reviewed in a tertiary PICU where 24/7 EEG cover is unavailable.
Retrospective EEG and clinical review of 108 PICU patients. Correlations were carried out between EEG and clinical variables including mortality. The role of EEG in clinical decision making was documented.
One hundred ninety-six EEGs were carried out in 108 PICU patients over 2.5 years (434 hours of recording). After exclusion of 1 outlying patient with epileptic encephalopathy, 136 EEGs (median duration, 65 minutes; range, 20 minutes to 4 hours 40 minutes) were included. Sixty-two patients (57%) were less than 12 months old. Seizures were detected in 18 of 107 patients (17%); 74% of seizures were subclinical; 72% occurred within the first 30 minutes of recording. Adverse EEG findings were associated with high mortality. Antiepileptic drug use was high in the studied population irrespective of EEG seizure detection. Prevalence of epileptiform discharges and EEG seizures diminished with increasing levels of sedation.

There have been important findings in recent years regarding the challenges and limitations of EEG-based monitoring during general anesthesia. The purpose of this review is to summarize key EEG-related concepts, as well as to highlight some of the advantages and disadvantages of processed and unprocessed EEG monitoring, especially for older patients with comorbidities undergoing cardiovascular surgery.
The brain is the target organ of anesthesia. Using the EEG or processed EEG to guide anesthetic administration during cardiovascular surgery conceptually allows precision patient-centered anesthesia. It is suggested that inadequate anesthesia, with the possibility of traumatic intraoperative awareness, can potentially be avoided. Furthermore, excessive anesthesia, with hemodynamic compromise and theoretical risk of delirium, can be minimized. Frail, older patients undergoing major surgery with preexisting neurocognitive disorders might be especially vulnerable to perioperative neurological and other complications. Tailoring anesthetic administration, based on individual patient needs partly guided by certain EEG features, might yield improved perioperative outcomes.
Ability to interpret the EEG during surgery might help anesthesia clinicians to individualize anesthetic administration to prevent adverse events, and optimize postoperative recovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31833865/

There is no conventional comparator technology for BFM assessment. The conventional comparator technology used as a benchmark for assessing BFMs technologies chosen by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to reﬂect the currently used standards in the National Health Service (NHS), was demarcated as ""standard anesthetic clinical monitoring"" and precisely deﬁned as ""the combination of routine clinical observation and electronic monitoring used in clinical practice to assess the adequacy of anesthesia."" Because BFMs are EEG-derived parameters, all conditions that can ""alter"" the raw EEG signal would subsequently change BFM indices to reflect other unrelated EEG events of patient-dependent pathophysiologic perturbations. In many instances we are often confronted with disparate BFM values that do not concur with ""standard anesthetic clinical monitoring"". Changes in BFM indices during acute cerebral pathology would be highly beneficial to trained informed clinicians as it alerts to something they would not otherwise be aware was happening. This fact-based, citation-supported, narrative review article provides better understanding of BFMs' limitations through examining various published reports of all values that did not coincide with a ""standard anesthetic clinical monitoring"" whether arising from an underlying alteration of patients' own EEG or those due to shortcomings in the BFM design or performance.

We developed a novel index, posteriorization/anteriorization (P/A) index, based on auditory evoked EEG signal and assessed whether it could differentiate between patients with or without RUS. Methods: EEG and BIS were sampled from 3 groups: 1. Patients undergoing sedation (n = 26); 2. Awake volunteers (n = 13, positive control for recall) 3. Patients undergoing general anesthesia (GA, n = 12, negative control for recall). In recovery, recall was assessed using the BRICE questionnaire. Of the 26 sedated patients, 12 experienced recall. Both The P/A index and BIS differentiated between patients with recall and no recall. However, BIS differentiation may have been sensitive to the main drug used for sedation (midazolam vs. propofol) and the P/A index did not show similar drug-based sensitivity. Furthermore, only BIS results were correlated with EMG. Conclusion: This pilot study provided support for the association between P/A index and recall after sedation.

We present the case of a 30-year-old man undergoing craniotomy for glioblastoma resection under general anesthesia who suffered tonic-clonic seizures captured in a specific pattern by the intraoperative EEG.
Our depth of anesthesia monitor recorded, before the seizure, a widening of the beta-wave performance in a distinct ""triangular-shaped"" pattern. This pattern was repeated before the second seizure. The patient had no previous history of seizures and following surgery no further seizures were recorded.
A spectrogram analysis showed a distinct increase in mean absolute beta power immediately prior to the first seizure. The EEG immediately prior to the second seizure was characterized by broadband noise. Both seizures were characterized by increased mean absolute delta, theta, and beta power.
The increase in EEG beta activity seen before the tonic-clonic movements may represent cortical irritability secondary to surgical manipulation, induced by electrical stimulation, reflecting progressive brain over-arousal. The attentive analysis of the relative beta power may have helped forecast the occurrence of the second seizure.

Scalp EEG recordings show different phases of electroencephalographic ictal activity during ECT seizures, documenting a pattern of seizures that may vary within and across individuals. In this case series, we used 64-electrode high-density EEG recording to detect topographic electroencephalographic changes not typically evident with conventional limited montages commonly used during ECT.
The EEG recordings were acquired from 5 participants (24 ECT sessions) during index courses for treatment-resistant depression. Using previously proposed staging criteria, the ictal EEG and simultaneously acquired video were interpreted by an expert reviewer blinded to study treatment parameters.
The EEG recordings of all seizures showed generalized, high-amplitude, central-positive complexes (CPCs), which emerged at the beginning of phase III (polyspike and slow wave activity), with median duration of 47 seconds (interquartile range, 77 seconds), ranging from 14 to 203 seconds. Although individuals showed variability in frequency and amplitude of CPCs, CPCs typically evolved from 4.0 to 1.5 Hz in frequency and decreased in amplitude as the seizure progressed. Elaborating on previously described phases of ECT-induced electrographic seizures, we describe variability in morphology at seizure termination. Initiation of CPCs typically corresponded with clonic movements, but often terminated after motor signs ceased.
Generalized, high-amplitude, CPCs during ECT are a previously uncharacterized ictal waveform during ECT, which may have important scientific and clinical value. These complexes offer a specific marker for correlating clinical outcomes in ECT and greater understanding of generalized tonic-clonic seizures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31764454/

We retrieved a total of 1023 articles addressing the use of EEG monitoring during anesthesia and conducted meta-analyses from 15 trials to determine the effect of EEG-guided anesthesia on the rate of unintentional awareness, postoperative delirium, neurocognitive disorder, and long-term mortality after surgery. After considering current evidence, the working group recommends that EEG monitoring should be considered as part of the vital organ monitors to guide anesthetic management. In addition, we encourage anesthesiologists to be knowledgeable in basic EEG interpretation, such as raw waveform, spectrogram, and processed indices, when using these devices. Current evidence suggests that EEG-guided anesthesia reduces the rate of awareness during total intravenous anesthesia and has similar efficacy in preventing awareness as compared with end-tidal anesthetic gas monitoring. There is, however, insufficient evidence to recommend the use of EEG monitoring for preventing postoperative delirium, neurocognitive disorder, or postoperative mortality.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31764163/

We assessed the applicability of ECoG to monitor different stages of sedation, as well as the influence of different patient characteristics, such as tumour volume, size, entity, and age or gender on permutation entropy (PeEn). We conducted retrospective analysis of the ECoG data of 16 patients, who underwent awake craniotomies because of left-sided brain tumours at our centre between 2014 and 2016.

PeEn scores in frontal and parietal leads did not differ significantly, making them both applicable for continuous surveillance during brain surgery. None of the following clinical characteristics showed significant correlation with PeEn scores: tumour volume, WHO grade, first or recurrent tumour, gender, and sex.

Data on medical history, etiology and semiology of SE, anticonvulsive medication usage, efficacy and safety of in-MDZ were retrospectively reviewed between 2015 and 2018. Time to end of SE regarding the administration of in-MDZ and ß-band effects were analyzed on EEG and with frequency analysis.
In total, 42 patients (mean age: 52.7 ± 22.7 years; 23 females) were treated with a median dose of 5 mg of in-MDZ (range: 2.5-15 mg, mean: 6.4 mg, SD: 2.6) for SE. The majority of the patients suffered from nonconvulsive SE (n = 24; 55.8%). In total, 24 (57.1%) patients were responders, as SE stopped following the administration of in-MDZ without any other drugs being given. On average, SE ceased on EEG at 05:05 (minutes:seconds) after the application of in-MDZ (median: 04:56; range: 00:29-14:53; SD:03:13). Frequency analysis showed an increased ß-band on EEG after the application of in-MDZ at 04:07 on average (median: 03:50; range: 02:20-05:40; SD: 01:09). Adverse events were recorded in six patients (14.3%), with nasal irritations present in five (11.9%) and prolonged sedation occurring in one (2.6%) patient.

Capturing this decrease during anesthesia-induced unconsciousness has been attempted using standard spectral analyses as these correlate relatively well with breakdowns in corticothalamic networks. Much of this work has involved the use of propofol to perturb brain activity, as it is one of the most widely used anesthetics for routine surgical anesthesia. Propofol administration alone produces EEG spectral characteristics similar to most hypnotics; however, inter-individual and drug variation render spectral measures inconsistent. Complexity measures of EEG signals could offer better measures to distinguish brain states, because brain activity exhibits nonlinear behavior at several scales during transitions of consciousness. We tested the potential of complexity analyses from nonlinear dynamics to identify loss and recovery of consciousness at clinically relevant timepoints. Patients undergoing propofol general anesthesia for various surgical procedures were identified as having changes in states of consciousness by the loss and recovery of response to verbal stimuli after induction and upon cessation of anesthesia, respectively. We demonstrate that nonlinear dynamics analyses showed more significant differences between consciousness states than spectral measures. Notably, attractors in conscious and anesthesia-induced unconscious states exhibited significantly different shapes. These shapes have implications for network connectivity, information processing, and the total number of states available to the brain at these different levels. They also reflect some of our general understanding of the network effects of consciousness in a way that spectral measures cannot. Thus, complexity measures could provide a universal means for reliably capturing depth of consciousness based on EEG changes at the beginning and end of anesthesia administration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31665174/

Intraoperative α-band power was significantly reduced in the LC group compared to the NC group (NC -1.6 [-4.48/1.17] dB vs. LC -6.0 [-9.02/-2.64] dB), and intraoperative α-band power was positively correlated with ""g score"" (Spearman correlation: r = 0.381; p = 0.018). Baseline EEG power did not show any associations with ""g.""
Preoperative cognitive impairment in older adults is associated with intraoperative absolute frontal α-band power, but not baseline α-band power.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31578031/

However, the incidence, characteristics and risk factors of these epileptiform patterns during sevoflurane anesthesia in children are poorly understood. The aim of this study is to systematically review the epileptic potential of sevoflurane in children with the EEG monitoring.
PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library (Central) will be systematically searched from inception to December 2018. The effect of sevoflurane on epileptic EEG patters in children will be studied. The primary outcome will be the incidence of epileptic discharges, the characteristics and risk factors of these epileptic discharges. Meta-analysis will be calculated using R software 3.5.1.
This study will offer new evidence of the incidence, characteristics and risk factors of EEG epileptic discharges during sevoflurane anesthesia.
The conclusion drawn from this systematic review will benefit the children with or without epilepsy undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia.
Ethics approval is unnecessary because data of individual patients will not be included and no privacy will be involved. The results of this review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal or a conference report. Amendments of the basic protocol will be documented in the comprehensive review.

31545708,Adaptive Sedation Monitoring From EEG in ICU Patients With Online Learning.,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2020,"Zheng WL, Sun H, Akeju O, Westover MB","Sedative medications are routinely administered to provide comfort and facilitate clinical care in critically ill ICU patients. Prior work shows that brain monitoring using electroencephalography (EEG) to track sedation levels may help medical personnel to optimize drug dosing and avoid the adverse effects of oversedation and undersedation. However, the performance of sedation monitoring methods proposed to date deal poorly with individual variability across patients, leading to inconsistent performance. To address this challenge we develop an online learning approach based on Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors (AROW). Our approach adaptively updates a sedation level prediction algorithm under a continuously evolving data distribution. The prediction model is gradually calibrated for individual patients in response to EEG observations and routine clinical assessments over time. The evaluations are performed on a population of 172 sedated ICU patients whose sedation levels were assessed using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (scores between -5 = comatose and 0 = awake). The proposed adaptive model achieves better performance than the same model without adaptation (average accuracies with tolerance of one level difference: 68.76% vs. 61.10%). Moreover, our approach is shown to be robust to sudden changes caused by label noise. Medication administrations have different effects on model performance. We find that the model performs best in patients receiving only propofol, compared to patients receiving no sedation or multiple simultaneous sedative medications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31545708/

However, limited data exist on antiseizure medication (ASM) safety for ES treatment in critically ill children.
We performed a single-center prospective observational study of encephalopathic critically ill children undergoing CEEG. Clinical and EEG features and ASM utilization patterns were evaluated. We determined the incidence, types, and risk factors for adverse events associated with ASM administration.
A total of 472 consecutive critically ill children undergoing CEEG were enrolled. ES occurred in 131 children (28%). Clinicians administered ASM to 108 children with ES (82%). ES terminated after the initial ASM in 38% of patients who received one ASM, after the second ASM in 35% of patients who received two ASMs, after the third ASM in 50% of patients who received three ASMs, and after the fourth ASM in 53% of patients who received four ASMs. Thirty patients (28%) received anesthetic infusions for ES management. Adverse events occurred in 18 patients (17%). Adverse effects were expected and resolved in all patients, and they were generally serious (in 15 patients) and definitely related (in 12 patients). Adverse events were rare in patients with acute symptomatic seizures requiring only one to two ASMs for treatment, but were more common in children with epilepsy, ictal-interictal continuum EEG patterns, or patients requiring more extensive ASM management.
ES ceased after one ASM in only 38% of critically ill children but ceased after two ASMs in 73% of critically ill children. Thus, ES management was often accomplished with readily available medications, but optimization of multistep ES management strategies might be beneficial. Adverse events were rare and manageable in children with acute symptomatic seizures requiring only one to two ASMs for treatment. Future studies are needed to determine whether management of acute symptomatic ES improves neurobehavioral outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31538340/

The use of critical care electroencephalographic monitoring has become a standard of care in many centers in the United States and other countries. The most common indication is to detect electrographic seizures and status epilepticus. Other indications include monitoring treatment efficacy in patients with electrographic seizures and status epilepticus, evaluating the degree of disturbance of function in patients with encephalopathy, monitoring brain function in patients treated with sedation and neuromuscular blocking agents, and event characterization. The urgent initiation of critical care electroencephalographic monitoring is recommended in certain clinical populations, but varies among institutions. The consensus among neurologists is to start treatment after identifying electrographic seizures or electrographic status epilepticus with or without clinical signs. However, the optimal treatment of nonconvulsive and electrographic-only seizures remains controversial. Critical care electroencephalographic monitoring has significant impact on clinical management, but there is lack of clear evidence that treatment guided by critical care electroencephalographic monitoring leads to improvement of clinical and neurodevelopmental outcome. There are substantial discrepancies among institutions on personnel and technical support used for critical care electroencephalographic monitoring. The optimal critical care electroencephalographic monitoring team should include electroencephalographers with experience in critical care electroencephalographic monitoring interpretation and appropriately trained technologists certified in electroencephalography by the American Board of Registration of Electroencephalographic and Evoked Potential Technologists specializing in critical care electroencephalographic monitoring or long-term monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31493974/

The aim of the study was to assess ICU physicians ability to perform preliminary interpretations of a simplified cEEG in the post cardiac arrest setting.
Five ICU physicians received training in interpretation of simplified cEEG - total training duration 1 day. The ICU physicians then interpreted 71 simplified cEEG recordings from 37 comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. The cEEG included amplitude-integrated EEG trends and two channels with original EEG-signals. Basic EEG background patterns and presence of epileptiform discharges or seizure activity were assessed on 5-grade rank-ordered scales based on standardized EEG terminology. An EEG-expert was used as reference.
There was substantial agreement (κ 0.69) for EEG background patterns and moderate agreement (κ 0.43) for epileptiform discharges between ICU physicians and the EEG-expert. Sensitivity for detecting seizure activity by ICU physicians was limited (50%), but with high specificity (87%).
After cardiac arrest, preliminary bedside interpretations of simplified cEEGs by trained ICU physicians may allow earlier detection of clinically relevant cEEG changes, prompting changes in patient management as well as additional evaluation by an EEG-expert. This strategy requires awareness of limitations of both the simplified electrode montage and the cEEG interpretations performed by ICU physicians. cEEG evaluation by an expert should not be delayed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31465539/

However, no monitoring techniques can accurately predict or detect AAGA. Since the first reflex for a patient during AAGA is to move, a passive brain-computer interface (BCI) based on the detection of an intention of movement would be conceivable to alert the anesthetist. However, the way in which propofol (i.e., an anesthetic commonly used for the general anesthesia induction) affects motor brain activity within the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal has been poorly investigated and is not clearly understood. For this reason, a detailed study of the motor activity behavior with a step-wise increasing dose of propofol is required and would provide a proof of concept for such an innovative BCI. The main goal of this study is to highlight the occurrence of movement attempt patterns, mainly changes in oscillations called event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS), in the EEG signal over the motor cortex, in healthy subjects, without and under propofol sedation, during four different motor tasks.
MOTANA is an interventional, prospective, exploratory, physiological, monocentric, and randomized study conducted in healthy volunteers under light anesthesia, involving EEG measurements before and after target-controlled infusion of propofol at three different effect-site concentrations (0 μg.ml
MOTANA is an exploratory study aimed at designing an innovative BCI based on EEG-motor brain activity that would detect an attempt to move by a patient under anesthesia. This would be of interest in the prevention of AAGA.

This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study that analyzed intraoperative connectivity patterns in adult surgical patients (N=53). Wireless, whole-scalp EEG data were collected in the postanesthesia care unit and assessed for relevance to clinical and neurocognitive recovery. Parietal alpha power and frontal-parietal connectivity (estimated by weighted phase lag index) were tested for associations with postanesthesia care unit discharge readiness and University of Michigan Sedation Scale scores upon postoperative admission. Bivariable correlation and regression models were constructed to test for unadjusted associations, then multivariable regression models were constructed to adjust for confounding.
Postoperative EEG patterns were characterized by a predominance of alpha parietal power and frontal-parietal connectivity. Neither relative parietal alpha power (% alpha, -0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.41 to 0.90; P=0.657) nor alpha frontal-parietal connectivity (weighted phase lag index, -82; 95% CI, -237 to 73; P=0.287) were associated with time until postanesthesia discharge criteria were met.

Propofol induced increased delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and gamma (25-40 Hz) power throughout sedation. In addition, there was decreased alpha power (9-11.5 Hz) in the occipital area and increased global beta (12-25 Hz)/gamma (25-40 Hz) power during mild sedation. Deep sedation was associated with increased theta (4-7 Hz)/alpha (9-11.5 Hz)/beta (12-25 Hz) power, which was maximal frontally.

The increase in entropy and BIS values is most likely caused by increased EMG activity and a higher level of consciousness. A strong EMG activity can increase entropy and BIS values because it is impossible to separate electroencephalography (EEG) from EMG, and this results from their overlapping power spectra. Thus, the entropy module may be more affected by EMG compared with the BIS module because it has more overlap with the power spectra of EEG and EMG. Several studies have suggested that EMG activity is most likely to increase, especially as it relates to the level of total intravenous anesthesia without a muscle relaxant or an insufficient analgesic level, which results in falsely increased entropy values. We present the case of a patient whose entropy values were falsely elevated by increased EMG activity resulting from light neuromuscular block or nociceptive stimuli during surgery even when undergoing desflurane anesthesia. This was closely related to the change in the neuromuscular block level and it was influenced by the degree of analgesia and the remifentanil infusion rate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31342813/

The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the logistic regression model.

The drug-independent system resulted in mean AUC=0.83 (0.17) to discriminate between the awake and sedated states.
The incorporation of large numbers of QEEG features and machine learning algorithms is feasible for next-generation monitors of sedation level. Different QEEG features were selected for propofol, sevoflurane, and dexmedetomidine groups, but the sedation-level estimator maintained a high performance for predicting MOAA/S independent of the drug used.

31314775,Alteration of coupling between brain and heart induced by sedation with propofol and midazolam.,PloS one,2019,"Won DO, Lee BR, Seo KS, Kim HJ, Lee SW","For a comprehensive understanding of the nervous system, several previous studies have examined the network connections between the brain and the heart in diverse conditions. In this study, we identified coupling between the brain and the heart along the continuum of sedation levels, but not in discrete sedation levels (e. g., wakefulness, conscious sedation, and deep sedation). To identify coupling between the brain and the heart during sedation, we induced several depths of sedation using patient-controlled sedation with propofol and midazolam. We performed electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis and extracted the instantaneous heart rate (HR) from the electrocardiogram (ECG). EEG spectral power dynamics and mean HR were compared along the continuum of sedation levels. We found that EEG sigma power was the parameter most sensitive to changes in the sedation level and was correlated with the mean HR under the effect of sedative agents. Moreover, we calculated the Granger causality (GC) value to quantify brain-heart coupling at each sedation level. Additionally, the GC analysis revealed noticeably different strengths and directions of causality among different sedation levels. In all the sedation levels, GC values from the brain to the heart (GCb→h) were higher than GC values from the heart to the brain (GCh→b). Moreover, the mean GCb→h increased as the sedation became deeper, resulting in higher GCb→h values in deep sedation (1.97 ± 0.18 in propofol, 2.02 ± 0.15 in midazolam) than in pre-sedation (1.71 ± 0.13 in propofol, 1.75 ± 0.11 in midazolam; p < 0.001). These results show that coupling between brain and heart activities becomes stronger as sedation becomes deeper, and that this coupling is more attributable to the brain-heart direction than to the heart-brain direction. These findings provide a better understanding of the relationship between the brain and the heart under specific conditions, namely, different sedation states.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31314775/

The impact of aggressive treatment of postanoxic RSE on long-term neurological outcome remains uncertain. We investigated neurological outcome of cardiac arrest patients with RSE treated with a standardized aggressive protocol with antiepileptic drugs and anesthetics, compared with patients with other electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns. A prospective cohort of 166 consecutive patients with cardiac arrest in coma was stratified according to four independent EEG patterns (benign; RSE; generalized periodic discharges (GPDs); malignant nonepileptiform) and multimodal prognostic indicators. Primary outcomes were survival and cerebral performance category (CPC) at 6 months. Refractory status epilepticus occurred in 36 patients (21.7%) and was treated with an aggressive standardized protocol as long as multimodal prognostic indicators were not unfavorable. Refractory status epilepticus started after 3 ± 2.3 days after cardiac arrest and lasted 4.7 ± 4.3 days. A benign electroencephalographic patterns was recorded in 76 patients (45.8%), a periodic pattern (GPDs) in 13 patients (7.8%), and a malignant nonepileptiform EEG pattern in 41 patients (24.7%). The four EEG patterns were highly associated with different prognostic indicators (low flow time, clinical motor seizures, N20 responses, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), neuroimaging). Survival and good neurological outcome (CPC 1 or 2) at 6 months were 72.4% and 71.1% for benign EEG pattern, 54.3% and 44.4% for RSE, 15.4% and 0% for GPDs, and 2.4% and 0% for malignant nonepileptiform EEG pattern, respectively.

The population of elderly patients is growing drastically with advances in medicine that have prolonged the life span. One of the direct consequence has been a significant increase in the request for anesthesia care for older patients despite the type of surgery (cardiac vs noncardiac and mainly orthopedic). Because the brain of this category of patients undergoes a specific triple influence (immune, metabolic, and inflammatory), some particular physiological, anatomical, and structural modifications must be taken into account because they expose these patients more specifically to postoperative cognitive disturbances. To prevent type of adverse outcome, a better knowledge and understanding of these neurosciences must be promoted. The strategies developed to prevent such adverse outcomes include the determination and detection of significant at-risk patients and improvement in the titration of anesthesia to reduce exposure of anesthesia to these patients through an adapted anesthesia-induced unconsciousness that avoids, as much as possible, the risk of toxic overdose with an overly deep brain depression. To accomplish this, the unprocessed electroencephalogram (EEG) and its spectrogram may represent a significant improvement in monitoring, first by allowing for the rapid recognition of repetitive or persistent EEG suppression by the on-line reading of the raw EEG trace and second by allowing for the accurate determination of the adequate anesthetic-induced state, obtained in general in this category of patients by substantially lowered doses of anesthetic agents. This represents a new methodology for anesthesia titration that is adjusted on a more case-by-case basis and is related to the physiology of individual patients. A better understanding of aging-induced brain transformations remains the key regarding the improvement of the anesthetic management of the always growing population of elderly patients. The promotion of the unprocessed EEG may represent the best method of preventing the risk of anesthetic toxicity, including postoperative cognitive dysfunctions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31279354/

They prevent intraoperative awareness with recall in specific patient populations and under a specific anesthetic regimen. They prevent intraoperative overdose, and they shorten recovery times. They also help to avoid lengthy intraoperative periods of suppression activity, which are known to be deleterious in terms of outcome.

This study aims to report the first propofol-induced refractory status epilepticus (SE) in patients with BECTS after 16 years of age, and to review SE in BECTS or induced by propofol.
A 16-year-old Chinese girl, who was diagnosed with BECTS at the age of 2 years, developed refractory SE induced by propofol administered during the maintenance stage of general anesthesia during a plastic surgery procedure.
Considering her medical history, EEG, and magnetic resonance images, and brain computed tomography, a diagnosis of refractory SE in BECTS was confirmed.
The patient had been seizure-free for 3 years from treatment with 2 anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) valproate acid (VPA) and oxcarbazepine (OXC), and had started monotherapy with OXC for 3 months before the seizure incidence. She had undergone blepharoplasty under local anesthesia prior to receiving general anesthesia. During the maintenance state she developed convulsive SE, which was uncontrolled seizure and lasted for 14 hours. The treatment for which included midazolam, diazepam, propofol, VPA, OXC, and levetiracetam (LEV).
The prolonged seizure was controlled by diazepam (4 mg/h), propofol (6 mg/kg/h), VPA (2400 mg/d intravenous injection). Subsequently, she was administered VPA (800 mg/d po), OXC (600 mg/d po), and LEV (1000 mg/d po). Finally, on the 17th day she was discharged, and did not have any seizure recurrence and EEG results were normal as noted during the 3-month follow-up.
This was the first report of an SE in BECTS patient past the remission age. This report implied that interventions of sedation or analgesia in a patient after remission age of BECTS might still be at risk of refractory SE and therefore, should be carefully evaluated and monitored during such procedures, especially when an AED medication has been withdrawn or altered.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31277145/

The Staccato system delivers drug deep into the lung via inhalation. In this phase 2a study, we investigated the ability of three different doses of Staccato alprazolam to suppress the electroencephalographic (EEG) photoparoxysmal response (PPR) compared with placebo in participants with photosensitive seizures.
Adults (18-60 years) with a diagnosis and history of PPR on EEG with or without an epilepsy diagnosis were eligible to participate. Participants received Staccato alprazolam 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg, and Staccato placebo (twice) in random order. Intermittent photic stimulation and clinical assessments were performed at one predose and seven postdose time points. The primary endpoint of the study was the change in standardized photosensitivity range (SPR) in participants receiving each dose of Staccato alprazolam.
Fifteen participants with a prior epilepsy diagnosis were screened; five were enrolled, randomized, and completed the study. All participants were white females with a mean (SD) age of 27.2 (6.8) years. All doses of Staccato alprazolam reduced the SPR at 2 minutes; the effect was sustained through 4 hours for the 0.5-mg dose and 6 hours for the 1.0- and 2.0-mg doses. The magnitude and duration of sedation and sleepiness were dose-related. Four participants (80%) experienced ≥1 adverse event (AE); none was severe or serious. Cough, diarrhea, dysgeusia, oral dysesthesia, sedation, and somnolence were experienced by two participants (40%) each.
This proof-of-concept study demonstrated that Staccato alprazolam 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg rapidly suppressed epileptiform activity in photosensitive participants with epilepsy.

All consecutive patients admitted in a tertiary cardiac arrest center between 2007 and 2016 still alive 48 h after admission with at least one EEG recorded during coma. EEG reactivity was defined as a reproducible waveform change in amplitude or frequency following standardized stimulation. Each EEG was classified based on American Clinical Neurophysiology Society nomenclatures and classified in highly malignant (including status epilepticus), malignant, or benign EEG. We assessed the predictive values of EEG reactivity and sedation effect for neurologic outcome at ICU discharge using the Cerebral Performance Category scale (with CPC 1-2 assumed as favorable outcome and CPC 3-4-5 considered as poor outcome).
Among 428 patients, a poor outcome was observed in 80% patients. The median time to EEG recording was 3 (1-4) days and 51% patients had a non-reactive EEG. The positive predictive value (PPV) of a non-reactive EEG to predict an unfavorable outcome was 97.1% (IC95% 93.6-98.9), increasing to 98.3% (IC95 94.1-99.8) when the EEG had been performed without sedation. In multivariate analysis, a non-reactive EEG was associated with poor outcome (OR 12.6 IC95% 4.7-33.6; p < 0.001).

It has been assumed that burst suppression represents a deeper state of anaesthesia from which it is more difficult to recover. This has not been directly demonstrated, however. Here, we test this hypothesis directly by assessing relationships between EEG suppression in human volunteers and recovery of consciousness.
We recorded the EEG of 27 healthy humans (nine women/18 men) anaesthetised with isoflurane 1.3 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for 3 h. Periods of EEG suppression and non-suppression were separated using principal component analysis of the spectrogram. After emergence, participants completed the digit symbol substitution test and the psychomotor vigilance test.
Volunteers demonstrated marked variability in multiple features of the suppressed EEG. In order to test the hypothesis that, for an individual subject, inclusion of features of suppression would improve accuracy of a model built to predict time of emergence, two types of models were constructed: one with a suppression-related feature included and one without. Contrary to our hypothesis, Akaike information criterion demonstrated that the addition of a suppression-related feature did not improve the ability of the model to predict time to emergence. Furthermore, the amounts of EEG suppression and decrements in cognitive task performance relative to pre-anaesthesia baseline were not significantly correlated.
These findings suggest that, in contrast to current assumptions, EEG suppression in and of itself is not an important determinant of recovery time or the degree of cognitive impairment upon emergence from anaesthesia in healthy adults.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31202561/

Commercially available electroencephalograph (EEG)-based DoA monitors are recommended only for certain anesthetic drugs and specific age-group patients. This paper presents a machine learning classification processor for accurate DoA estimation irrespective of the patient's age and anesthetic drug. The classification is solely based on six features extracted from EEG signal, i.e., spectral edge frequency (SEF), beta ratio, and four bands of spectral energy (FBSE). A machine learning fine decision tree classifier is adopted to achieve a four-class DoA classification (deep, moderate, and light DoA versus awake state). The feature selection and the classification processor are optimized to achieve the highest classification accuracy for the state of moderate anesthesia required for the surgical operations. The proposed 256-point fast Fourier transform accelerator is implemented to realize SEF, beta ratio, and FBSE that enables minimal latency and high accuracy feature extraction. The proposed DoA processor is implemented using a 65 nm CMOS technology and experimentally verified using field programming gate array (FPGA) based on the EEG recordings of 75 patients undergoing elective surgery with different types of anesthetic agents.

It has been widely used for monitoring depth of anesthesia (DoA). In this study, we propose a method that combines multiple EEG-based features with artificial neural network (ANN) to assess the DoA. Multiple EEG-based features can express the states of the brain more comprehensively during anesthesia. First, four parameters including permutation entropy, 95% spectral edge frequency, BetaRatio and SynchFastSlow were extracted from the EEG signal. Then, the four parameters were set as the inputs to an ANN which used bispectral index (BIS) as the reference output. 16 patient datasets during propofol anesthesia were used to evaluate this method. The results indicated that the accuracies of detecting each state were 86.4% (awake), 73.6% (light anesthesia), 84.4% (general anesthesia), and 14% (deep anesthesia). The correlation coefficient between BIS and the index of this method was 0.892 ( p < 0.001 ).

Raw EEG analysis provides direct neurophysiologic measurement of cerebral activity. The relationship between age and EEG has rarely been reported, thus the aim of the present study was to compare raw electroencephalography (EEG) among different age groups of surgical patients under general anesthesia with 1.0 MAC sevoflurane. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 135 patients aged 0-80 years old (ASA physical status I or II) undergoing surgery, who were divided into 6 groups: 1-12 months old (group 1), 1-3 years old (group 2), 3-6 years old (group 3), 6-18 years old (group 4), 18-65 years old (group 5), and 65-80 years old (group 6). Different raw EEG waves (alpha, delta, and theta) were compared for all subjects. RESULTS The BIS values in groups 1 to 6 were 52.2±12.7, 55.0±8.0, 44.5±7.3, 43.8±7.3, 44.2±6.2, and 49.1±6.2 respectively. Compared with groups 1 and 2 (52.2±12.7, 55.0±8.0), BIS values of groups 3, 4, and 5 (44.5±7.3, 43.8±7.3, 44.2±6.2, respectively) were lower (P<0.05). Theta frequency was observed in the 6 groups. The EEG frequencies in groups 1 to 6 were 6.0 (5.5-6.0), 6.0 (5.5-6.0), 6.0 (5.5-6.0), 6.0 (6.0-7.0), 6.3 (6.0-7.0), and 6.0 (5.1-6.0), respectively. Compared with group 6, EEG frequencies in groups 4 and 5 were higher (P<0.05). BIS value was significantly correlated with EEG frequency (R²=0.063, P<0.01).

For nonlinear and nonstationary signals, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) works as a dyadic filter bank to reserve local dynamical properties in decomposed components. Moreover, cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling analysis illustrates that the coupling between the phase of low-frequency components and the amplitude of high-frequency components is correlated with the brain functions of sensory detection, working memory, consciousness, and attentional selection. To improve the functions of phase-amplitude coupling analysis, we utilized a multi-timescale approach based on EMD to assess changes in brain functions in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness using a measure of phase-amplitude coupling. Two groups of patients received two different anesthetic recipes (with or without ketamine) during the induction period of GA. Long-term (low-frequency) coupling represented a common transitional process of brain functions from consciousness to unconsciousness with a decay trend in both groups. By contrast, short-term coupling reflected a reverse trend to long-term coupling. However, the measures of short-term coupling also reflected a higher degree of coupling for the group with ketamine compared with that without ketamine. In addition, the coupling phase is a factor of interest. The phases for different combinations of coupling components showed significant changes in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. The coupling between the delta-band phase and the theta-band amplitude changed from in-phase to out-phase coupling during the induction process from consciousness to unconsciousness. The changes in the coupling phase in EEG signals were abrupt and sensitive in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31127152/
31124327,Comparative Analysis of Phase Lag Entropy and Bispectral Index as Anesthetic Depth Indicators in Patients Undergoing Thyroid Surgery with Nerve Integrity Monitoring.,Journal of Korean medical science,2019,"Seo KH, Kim KM, Lee SK, John H, Lee J","Most depth of anesthesia (DOA) monitors rely on the temporal characteristics of a single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) and cannot provide spatial or connectivity information. Phase lag entropy (PLE) reflects DOA by calculating diverse connectivity from temporal patterns of phase relationships. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of PLE and bispectral index (BIS) monitors for assessing DOA during anesthesia induction, nerve integrity monitoring (NIM), and anesthesia emergence.
Thirty-five patients undergoing elective thyroid surgery with recurrent laryngeal nerve NIM received propofol and remifentanil via target-controlled infusion. After applying PLE and BIS monitors, propofol infusion was initiated at a calculated effect site concentration (Ce) of 2 μg/mL and then increased in 1-μg/mL Ce increments. After propofol Ce reached 5 μ/mL, a remifentanil infusion was begun, and anesthesia induction was considered complete. During NIM, PLE and BIS values were compared at a specific time points from platysma muscle exposure to subcutaneous tissue closure. PLE and BIS values were recorded continuously from preanesthetic state to full recovery of orientation; bias and limits of agreement between monitors were calculated.
PLE and BIS values decreased progressively with increasing propofol Ce during anesthetic induction and increased by stages during emergence. The prediction probabilities of PLE and BIS for detecting propofol Ce changes were 0.750 and 0.756, respectively, during induction and 0.749 and 0.746, respectively, during emergence. No aberrant PLE or BIS values occurred during NIM. Correlation coefficients for BIS and PLE were 0.98 and 0.92 during induction and emergence, respectively. PLE values were significantly higher than BIS values at full recovery of orientation. Estimated bias between monitors was -4.16 ± 8.7, and 95% limits of agreement were -21.21 to 12.89.
PLE is a reasonable alternative to BIS for evaluating consciousness and DOA during general anesthesia and during NIM.

31120896,Proof of principle: Preoperative cognitive reserve and brain integrity predicts intra-individual variability in processed EEG (Bispectral Index Monitor) during general anesthesia.,PloS one,2019,"Hernaiz Alonso C, Tanner JJ, Wiggins ME, Sinha P, Parvataneni HK, Ding M, Seubert CN, Rice MJ, Garvan CW, Price CC","Preoperative cognitive reserve and brain integrity may explain commonly observed intraoperative fluctuations seen on a standard anesthesia depth monitor used ubiquitously in operating rooms throughout the nation. Neurophysiological variability indicates compromised regulation and organization of neural networks. Based on theories of neuronal integrity changes that accompany aging, we assessed the relative contribution of: 1) premorbid cognitive reserve, 2) current brain integrity (gray and white matter markers of neurodegenerative disease), and 3) current cognition (specifically domains of processing speed/working memory, episodic memory, and motor function) on intraoperative neurophysiological variability as measured from a common intraoperative tool, the Bispectral Index Monitor (BIS).
This sub-study included participants from a parent study of non-demented older adults electing unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) with the same surgeon and anesthesia protocol, who also completed a preoperative neuropsychological assessment and preoperative 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Left frontal two-channel derived EEG via the BIS was acquired preoperatively (un-medicated and awake) and continuously intraoperatively with time from tourniquet up to tourniquet down. Data analyses used correlation and regression modeling.
Fifty-four participants met inclusion criteria for the sub-study. The mean (SD) age was 69.5 (7.4) years, 54% were male, 89% were white, and the mean (SD) American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 2.76 (0.47). We confirmed that brain integrity positively and significantly associated with each of the cognitive domains of interest. EEG intra-individual variability (squared deviation from the mean BIS value between tourniquet up and down) was significantly correlated with cognitive reserve (r = -.40, p = .003), brain integrity (r = -.37, p = .007), and a domain of processing speed/working memory (termed cognitive efficiency; r = -.31, p = .021). Hierarchical regression models that sequentially included age, propofol bolus dose, cognitive reserve, brain integrity, and cognitive efficiency found that intraoperative propofol bolus dose (p = .001), premorbid cognitive reserve (p = .008), and current brain integrity (p = .004) explained a significant portion of intraoperative intra-individual variability from the BIS monitor.
Older adults with higher premorbid reserve and less brain disease were more stable intraoperatively on a depth of anesthesia monitor. Researchers need to replicate findings within larger cohorts and other surgery types.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31120896/

Electroencephalography (EEG) provides insight into brain activity during anesthesia. The primary goal of this prospective observational pilot study was to assess the prevalence of isoelectric EEG events-a sign of deep anesthesia-in infants and young children undergoing general anesthesia using sevoflurane or propofol infusion for maintenance.
Children 0-37 months of age requiring general anesthesia for surgery excluding cardiac, intracranial, and emergency cases were enrolled by age: 0-3, 4-6, 7-12, 13-18, and 19-37 months. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane or propofol infusion. EEG was recorded from induction to extubation. Isoelectric EEG events (amplitude <20 µV, lasting ≥2 seconds) were characterized by occurrence, number, duration, and percent of isoelectric EEG time over anesthetic time. Associations with patient demographics, anesthetic, and surgical factors were determined.
Isoelectric events were observed in 63% (32/51) (95% confidence interval [CI], 49-76) of patients. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of isoelectric events per patient was 3 (0-31), cumulative isoelectric time per patient was 12 seconds (0-142 seconds), isoelectric time per event was 3 seconds (0-4 seconds), and percent of total isoelectric over anesthetic time was 0.1% (0%-2.2%). The greatest proportion of isoelectric events occurred between induction and incision. Isoelectric events were associated with higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, propofol bolus, endotracheal tube use, and lower arterial pressure during surgical phase.
Isoelectric EEG events were common in infants and young children undergoing sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia. Although the clinical significance of these events remains uncertain, they suggest that dosing based on population pharmacokinetics and patient hemodynamics is often associated with unnecessary deep anesthesia during surgical procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31107263/

We compared the performance of phase lag entropy with the bispectral index™ in 30 patients scheduled for elective surgery. We initiated a target-controlled infusion of propofol using the Schnider model, and assessed sedation levels using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale every 30 s with each stepwise increase in the effect-site propofol concentration. Phase lag entropy and bispectral index values were recorded. The correlation coefficient and prediction probability between phase lag entropy or bispectral index and the sedation level or effect-site propofol concentration were analysed. We calculated baseline variabilities of phase lag entropy and bispectral index. In addition, we applied a non-linear mixed-effects model to obtain the pharmacodynamic relationships among the effect-site propofol concentration, phase lag entropy or bispectral index and sedation level. As sedation increased, phase lag entropy and bispectral index both decreased. The prediction probability values of phase lag entropy and bispectral index for sedation levels were 0.697 and 0.700 (p = 0.261) and for the effect-site concentration of propofol were 0.646 and 0.630 (p = 0.091), respectively. Baseline variability in phase lag entropy and bispectral index was 3.3 and 5.7, respectively. The predicted propofol concentrations, using the Schnider pharmacokinetic model, producing a 50% probability of moderate and deep sedation were 1.96 and 3.01 μg.ml",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31106853/

Recent theoretical considerations suggest that consciousness is linked to the complexity of distributed interactions within the corticothalamic system. The fractal dimension (FD) is a quantitative parameter that has been extensively used to analyse the complexity of structural and functional patterns of the human brain. In this study we investigate FD to assess whether it can discriminate between consciousness and different states of unconsciousness in healthy individuals.
We study 69 high-density electroencephalogram (hd-EEG) measurements after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 18 healthy subjects progressing from wakefulness to non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and sedation induced by different anaesthetic agents (xenon and propofol). We quantify the integration of thalamocortical networks by calculating the FD of a spatiotemporal voxelization obtained from the locations of all sources that are significantly activated by the perturbation (4DFD). Moreover, we study the temporal evolution of the evoked spatial distributions and compute a measure of the differentiation of the response by means of the Higuchi FD (HFD). Finally, a Fractal Dimension Index (FDI) of perturbational complexity is computed as the product of both quantities: integration FD (4DFD) and differentiation FD (HFD).
We found that FDI is significantly lower in sleep and sedation when compared to wakefulness and provides an almost perfect intra-subject discrimination between conscious and unconscious states.
These results support the combination of FD measures of cortical integration and cortical differentiation as a novel paradigm of tracking complex spatiotemporal dynamics in the brain that could provide further insights into the link between complexity and the brain's capacity to sustain consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31104702/

Seizures in approximately half of children with infantile spasms fail to improve with initial treatment attempts; at present, data regarding alternative treatments are limited. We assessed the efficacy of clobazam as an adjunctive therapy in patients whose seizures failed to respond to initial regimens of standard treatment for infantile spasms. All patients from Severance Children's Hospital who received clobazam as adjunctive therapy for infantile spasms were selected for the study. The efficacy of clobazam was evaluated by assessing the daily spasm frequency. Patients were categorized as complete responders if the spasms disappeared within 2 weeks of introducing clobazam, and the patients became spasm-free during weeks 3 and 4. Tolerability was gauged by analyzing adverse events and discontinuation rates. In all, 171 patients qualified for the analysis. Clobazam was introduced after the administration of 2.6 (median; interquartile range [IQR], 1.0-4.0) failed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), at the age of 8.2 months (IQR, 6.0-10.0 months). After clobazam therapy was initiated, 38 (22.2%) patients became spasm-free for ≥2 weeks. Thirteen out of the 38 complete responders remained spasm-free until the last follow-up and did not require the administration of other AEDs. In 10 patients, the electroencephalogram (EEG) tracings were also within normal limits. These patients were successfully weaned off of all AEDs. Patients with conditions of unknown etiology, who had fewer prior exposures to AEDs, and had not received prior adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)/steroids were more likely to have complete spasm control than the others. Adverse effects were minor, and only 6 of 101 (6%) patients who experienced adverse events had their treatments discontinued during the 3-month follow-up period. The most common adverse events observed were hypersalivation, sedation, and sleep disturbance. Thus, clobazam might be an effective and safe alternative therapeutic option in patients whose seizures failed to respond to initial regimens of standard treatment for infantile spasms. Further prospective studies on clobazam for infantile spasms, focusing on specific good response groups, dosing protocols, and long-term outcome are needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31059922/

This was a prospective, single-center observational study of infants and children resuscitated from cardiac arrest who underwent conventional EEG monitoring with standardized EEG scoring. Logistic regression evaluated the marginal effect of each EEG variable or EEG variable combinations on the outcome. The primary outcome was neurobehavioral outcome (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score), and the secondary outcome was mortality. The authors identified the models with the highest areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), evaluated the optimal models using a 5-fold cross-validation approach, and calculated test characteristics maximizing specificity.
Eighty-nine infants and children were evaluated. Unfavorable neurologic outcome (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score 4-6) occurred in 44 subjects (49%), including mortality in 30 subjects (34%). A model incorporating a four-level EEG Background Category (normal, slow-disorganized, discontinuous or burst-suppression, or attenuated-flat), stage 2 Sleep Transients (present or absent), and Reactivity-Variability (present or absent) had the highest AUC. Five-fold cross-validation for the optimal model predicting neurologic outcome indicated a mean AUC of 0.75 (range, 0.70-0.81) and for the optimal model predicting mortality indicated a mean AUC of 0.84 (range, 0.76-0.97). The specificity for unfavorable neurologic outcome and mortality were 95% and 97%, respectively. The positive predictive value for unfavorable neurologic outcome and mortality were both 86%.
The specificity of the optimal model using a combination of early EEG features was high for unfavorable neurologic outcome and mortality in critically ill children after cardiac arrest. However, the positive predictive value was only 86% for both outcomes. Therefore, EEG data must be considered in overall clinical context when used for neuroprognostication early after cardiac arrest.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31033654/
31016567,A computationally bio-inspired framework of brain activities based on cognitive processes for estimating the depth of anesthesia.,Australasian physical & engineering sciences in medicine,2019,"Hosseini SA, Naghibi-Sistani MB","This paper develops a computationally bio-inspired framework of brain activities based on concepts, such as sensory register (SR), encoding, emotion, short-term memory (STM), selective attention, working memory (WM), forgetting, long-term memory (LTM), sustained memory (SM), and response selection for estimating the depth of anesthesia (DOA) using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Different brain regions, such as the thalamus, cortex, neocortex, amygdala, striatum, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and hippocampus, are considered for developing a cognitive architecture and a computationally bio-inspired framework. A clinical study was managed on twenty-two patients corresponding to three anesthetic states, including awake state, moderate anesthesia, and general anesthesia. The proposed approach utilizes a multiple of dynamically reconfigurable neural networks with radial basis function (RBF) and its associated data processing mechanisms. The emotion effect in the model, dynamic RBFs in WM and LTMs, and adjusting the adaptive weights in the last layer are the main innovations of the proposed approach. In the proposed approach, various incoming information is entered into the model. The correct labeling process of EEG signals is performed by qualitative and quantitative analyses of peripheral parameters. Then, an SR is used to accumulate the pre-processed EEG segment for a period of 2.3 s. Feature extraction is performed in the encoding stage as a primary perception. The output of this stage can be transferred to STM and WM with a bottom-up involuntary attentional capture. LTM and SM are a fairly permanent reservoir for information which is passed from WM using a top-down voluntary attention mechanism. Finally, weighting factors in SM and LTMs outputs are determined and then response selection is used by winner-take-all (WTA) strategy. The results indicate that the proposed approach can classify in different anesthetic states with an average accuracy of 89.2%. Results also indicate that the combined use of the above elements can effectively decipher the cognitive process task. A final comparison between the obtained results and the previous method on the same database indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for estimating DOA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31016567/

The first stage of the hierarchical SVM structure identifies the awake state by extracting Shannon Permutation Entropy, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis and frequency features. Then deep state is identified by extracting the sample entropy feature; and finally light and general states are identified by extracting the three mentioned features of the first step.

We developed predictive models utilizing random forest classifiers trained on patient age and 8 QEEG features to predict outcome. The features included SD of each EEG channel, normalized band power in alpha, beta, theta, delta, and gamma wave frequencies, line length, and regularity function scores. We measured outcomes using Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) scores. We evaluated the models using 5-fold cross-validation and 1,000 bootstrap samples.
The best performing model had a 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of 0.8 (0.88 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). It had a positive predictive value of 0.79 and a sensitivity of 0.84 in predicting patients with favorable outcomes (PCPC score of 1-3). It had a negative predictive value of 0.8 and a specificity of 0.75 in predicting patients with unfavorable outcomes (PCPC score of 4-6).

30959192,Cortical dynamics during psychedelic and anesthetized states induced by ketamine.,NeuroImage,2019,"Li D, Mashour GA","Ketamine is a unique drug that has psychedelic and anesthetic properties in a dose-dependent manner. Recent studies have shown that ketamine anesthesia appears to maintain the spatiotemporal complexity of cortical activation evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation, while a psychedelic dose of ketamine is associated with increased spontaneous magnetoencephalographic signal diversity. However, a systematic investigation of the dose-dependent effects of ketamine on cortical complexity using the same modality is required. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the complexity level stabilizes or fluctuates over time for the duration of ketamine exposure. Here we investigated the spatiotemporal complexity of spontaneous high-density scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals in healthy volunteers during alterations of consciousness induced by both subanesthetic and anesthetic doses of ketamine. Given the fast transient spectral dynamics, especially during the gamma-burst pattern after loss of consciousness, we employed a method based on Hidden Markov modeling to classify the EEG signals into a discrete set of brain states that correlated with different behavioral states. We characterized the spatiotemporal complexity specific for each brain state as measured through the Lempel-Ziv complexity algorithm. After controlling for signal diversity due to spectral changes, we found that the subanesthetic dose of ketamine is associated with an elevated complexity level relative to baseline, while the brain activity following an anesthetic dose of ketamine is characterized by alternating low and high complexity levels until stabilizing at a high level comparable to that during baseline. Thus, spatiotemporal complexity associated with ketamine-induced state transitions has features of general anesthesia, normal consciousness, and altered states of consciousness. These results improve our understanding of the complex pharmacological, neurophysiological, and phenomenological properties of ketamine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30959192/

Intermittent alpha loss during surgery, unexplained by changes in anaesthetic or opioid concentrations, could represent arousal of the cortex as a result of increased surgical stimulation.
A generalised linear model was fitted to alpha power recorded from patients undergoing general anaesthesia from induction until waking using three explanatory variables: age-adjusted volatile anaesthetic effect-site concentration, and estimated effect-site propofol and opioid concentrations. Model residuals were decomposed into uncorrelated white noise and a fluctuating auto-correlated trend. Deviations of this local trend were classified as 'unexpected alpha dropout events'. To investigate whether these alpha dropouts might be explained by the effect of noxious stimulation, we related their occurrence to whether a patient was undergoing surgery involving the body cavity or not.
Alpha power dropouts occurred in 73 of the 237 patients included in the final analysis (31%, median amplitude of -3.5 dB, duration=103 s). They showed a bimodal or broadly skewed distribution, being more probable soon after initial incision (32%), dropping to around 10% at 1 h, and then again increasing to >30% in operations lasting >3 h. Multivariate analysis showed that alpha dropouts were significantly associated with body cavity surgery (P=0.003) and with longer operations (P<0.001).
A loss of alpha power, unexplained by changes in anaesthetic or opioid concentrations, is suggestive of thalamocortical depolarisation induced by body cavity noxious stimuli, and could provide a measure of nociception during surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30915994/

Delirium in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) could predict adverse clinical outcomes.
We investigated a potential link between intraoperative EEG patterns and PACU delirium as well as an association of PACU delirium with perioperative outcomes, readmission and length of hospital stay. The risk factors for PACU delirium were also explored. Data were collected from 626 patients receiving general anaesthesia for procedures that would not interfere with frontal EEG recording.
Of the 626 subjects enrolled, 125 tested positive for PACU delirium. Whilst age, renal failure, and pre-existing neurological disease were associated with PACU delirium in the univariable analysis, the multivariable analysis revealed the importance of information derived from the EEG, anaesthetic technique, anaesthesia duration, and history of stroke or neurodegenerative disease. The occurrence of EEG burst suppression during maintenance [odds ratio (OR)=1.86 (1.13-3.05)] and the type of EEG emergence trajectory may be predictive of PACU delirium. Specifically, EEG emergence trajectories lacking significant spindle power were strongly associated with PACU delirium, especially in cases that involved ketamine or nitrous oxide [OR=6.51 (3.00-14.12)]. Additionally, subjects with PACU delirium were at an increased risk for readmission [OR=2.17 (1.13-4.17)] and twice as likely to stay >6 days in the hospital.

30893116,Neuromonitoring in paediatric anaesthesia.,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2019,"Davidson A, Skowno J","There has been a steady advance in neuromonitoring during anaesthesia. Inevitably much of the research is first done in adults and later in children. This review will focus on the recent paediatric publications (2017-2019) in two areas of neuromonitoring - measuring anaesthesia effect and cerebral perfusion and oxygenation.
For EEG-derived depth monitors, the main recent advances have been in better understanding their performance in infants. For the first time, large multichannel EEG studies on infants have focused on understanding the basic principles of how anaesthesia impacts on the EEG of the developing brain in a way different to the older brain. Nociception monitors are beginning to be studied in children. In the area of optical neuromonitoring, studies show that cerebral desaturation during both general and spinal anaesthesia in infants is uncommon in neonates and infants. Further work emphasizes the importance of CO2 levels on cerebral oxygenation, and demonstrates impaired cerebral autoregulation in premature infants undergoing laparotomies.
The impact of anaesthesia on the EEG of small infants has some gross similarities to older children but there are fundamental differences, which mandate separate calibration of anaesthesia depth monitors. The role of nociception monitors in children has yet to be defined. Cerebral oxygenation monitoring during paediatric anaesthesia is improving our understanding of cerebral perfusion in this period, but as with almost all monitoring, evidence that its use improves outcome is not yet available.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30893116/

Two recent studies suggest that deeper inhalational anesthesia monitored by BIS protects against OCR; we wondered if our data correlated similarly.
In an ongoing, prospective study of OCR/TCR elicited by 10-s, 200 g square-wave traction on extraocular muscles (EOM) from 2009 to 2013, anesthetic depth was estimated in cohorts using either BIS or Narcotrend monitors. The depth of anesthesia was deliberately varied between first and second EOM tested.
From 1992 through 2013, 2833 cases of OCR during strabismus surgery were monitored. Excluding re-operations and cases with anticholinergic, OCR from first EOM traction averaged - 20.2 ± 21.8% (S.D.) with a range from - 95 to + 25% in patients aged 0.2 to 90 (median 6.5) years. We did not find correlation between %OCR and brain wave for 97 patients with BIS monitoring and 91 with Narcotrend. With intra-patient controls between first and second muscle, the difference in brain wave did not correlate with difference in %OCR for BIS (r = 0.0002, 95% C. I -0.0002, 0.002, p = 0.30) or for Narcotrend (r = - 0.001, 95% C. I -0.004, 0.001, p = 0.32). Secondary multi-variable analysis demonstrated significant association on %OCR particularly with BIS monitor, opioid, propofol and nitrous oxide concentration in the second EOM tensioned. Sevoflurane concentration correlated better with BIS monitor in second and third EOM tension. %OCR correlated with younger age (p < 0.01). OCR with rapid onset was more profound than those with gradual onset (difference in means 18, 95% C. I 10, 26%).
We were unable to confirm a direct correlation between brain wave monitor and OCR when using multifactorial anesthetic agents. The discrepency with other studies probably reflects direct impact of inhalational agent concentration and less deliberate quantification of EOM tension. We found no level of BIS or Entropy EEG monitoring that uniformly prevents OCR.

30855319,Antiseizure medications in critical care: an update.,Current opinion in critical care,2019,"Allen B, Vespa PM","Seizures and status epilepticus are very common diagnoses in the critically ill patient and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There is an abundance of research on the utility of antiseizure medications in this setting, but limited randomized-controlled trials to guide the selection of medications in these patients. This review examines the current guidelines and treatment strategies for status epilepticus and provides an update on newer antiseizure medications in the critical care settings.
Time is brain applies to status epilepticus, with delays in treatment corresponding with worsened outcomes. Establishing standardized treatment protocols within a health system, including prehospital treatment, may lead to improved outcomes. Once refractory status epilepticus is established, continuous deep sedation with intravenous anesthetic agents should be effective. In cases, which prove highly refractory, novel approaches should be considered, with recent data suggesting multiple recently approved antiseizure medications, appropriate therapeutic options, as well as novel approaches to upregulate extrasynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid channels with brexanolone.
Although there are many new treatments to consider for seizures and status epilepticus in the critically ill patient, the most important predictor of outcome may be rapid diagnosis and treatment. There are multiple new and established medications that can be considered in the treatment of these patients once status epilepticus has become refractory, and a multidrug regimen will often be necessary.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30855319/
30827087,Technical improvements in carotid revascularization based on the mechanism of procedural stroke.,The Journal of cardiovascular surgery,2019,"Fassaert LM, de Borst GJ","The benefit of carotid revascularization in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis is hampered by the risk of stroke due to the intervention itself. The risk of periprocedural strokes is higher for carotid artery stenting (CAS) as compared to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Over the past years, the pathophysiological mechanism responsible for periprocedural stroke seems to unfold step by step. Initially, all procedural strokes were thought to be the result of technical errors during surgical repair: cerebral ischemia due to clamping time of the carotid artery, cerebral embolization of atherosclerotic debris due to manipulation of the atheroma or thrombosis of the artery. Following improvements in surgical techniques, technical skills, new intraoperative monitoring technologies such as angioscopy, and the results of the first large clinical randomized controlled trials (RCT) it was believed that most periprocedural strokes were of thromboembolic nature, while a large part of these caused by technical error. Nowadays, analyses of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of procedural stroke make a clinically relevant distinction between intra-procedural and postprocedural strokes. Intra-procedural stroke is defined as hypoperfusion due to clamping (CEA) or dilatation (CAS) and embolization from the carotid plaque (both CEA and CAS). Postprocedural stroke can be caused by thrombo-embolisation but seems to have a primarily hemodynamic origin. Besides thrombotic occlusion of the carotid artery, cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) due to extensively increased cerebral revascularization is the most reported pathophysiological mechanism of postprocedural stroke. Multiple technical improvements have attempted to lower the risk of periprocedural stroke. The introduction of antiplatelet therapy (APT) has significantly reduced the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with carotid stenosis. Over the years, recommendations regarding APT changed. While for a long time APT was discontinued prior to surgery because of a fear of increased bleeding risk, nowadays continuation of APT during carotid intervention (aspirin monotherapy or even dual APT including clopidogrel) is found to be safe and effective. In CAS patients, dual APT up to three months' postprocedural is considered best. Stent design and cerebral protection devices (CPD) for CAS procedure are continuously under development. Trials have suggested a benefit of closed-cell stent design over open-cell stent design in order to reduce procedural stroke, while the benefit of CPD during stenting is still a matter of debate. Although CPD reduce the risk of procedural stroke, a higher number of new ischemic brain lesions detected on diffusion weighted imaging was found in patients treated with CPD. In patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia, adequate use of cerebral monitoring (EEG and transcranial Doppler [TCD]) has reduced the number of intraoperative stroke by detecting embolization and thereby guiding the surgeon to adjust his technique or to selectively shunt the carotid artery. In addition, TCD is able to adequately identify and exclude patients at risk for CHS. For CAS, the additional value of periprocedural cerebral monitoring to prevent strokes needs urgent attention. In conclusion, this review provides an overview of the pathophysiological mechanism of stroke following carotid revascularization (both CAS and CEA) and of the technical improvements that have contributed to reducing this stroke risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30827087/

Such episodes appear to be predictive of further episodes of inpatient delirium and associated adverse outcomes. Frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) findings of suppression patterns and low proprietary index values have been associated with postoperative delirium and poor outcomes. However, the efficacy of titrating anaesthesia to proprietary index targets for preventing delirium remains contentious. We aim to assess the efficacy of two strategies which we hypothesise could prevent post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) delirium by maximising the alpha oscillation observed in frontal EEG channels during the maintenance and emergence phases of anaesthesia.
This is a 2 × 2 factorial, double-blind, stratified, randomised control trial of 600 patients. Eligible patients are those aged 60 years or over who are undergoing non-cardiac, non-intracranial, volatile-based anaesthesia of expected duration of more than 2 h. Patients will be stratified by pre-operative cognitive status, surgery type and site. For the maintenance phase of anaesthesia, patients will be randomised (1:1) to an alpha power-maximisation anaesthesia titration strategy versus standard care avoiding suppression patterns in the EEG. For the emergence phase of anaesthesia, patients will be randomised (1:1) to early cessation of volatile anaesthesia and emergence from an intravenous infusion of propofol versus standard emergence from volatile anaesthesia only. The primary study outcomes are the power of the frontal alpha oscillation during the maintenance and emergence phases of anaesthesia. Our main clinical outcome of interest is PACU delirium.
This is a largely exploratory study; the extent to which EEG signatures can be modified by titration of pharmacological agents is not known. The underlying concept is maximisation of anaesthetic efficacy by individualised drug titration to a clearly defined EEG feature. The interventions are already clinically used strategies in anaesthetic practice, but have not been formally evaluated. The addition of propofol during the emergence phase of volatile-based general anaesthesia is known to reduce emergence delirium in children; however, the efficacy of this strategy in older patients is not known.

The study suggested that patients with HIE are unable to generate EEG slow waves during propofol anesthesia 48 h after cardiac arrest (CA). Since a low number of electrodes would make the method clinically more practical, we now investigated whether our results received with a full EEG cap could be reproduced using only forehead electrodes. Experimental data from comatose post-CA patients (N = 10) were used. EEG was recorded approximately 48 h after CA using 19-channel EEG cap during a controlled propofol exposure. The slow wave activity was calculated separately for all electrodes and four forehead electrodes (Fp1, Fp2, F7, and F8) by determining the low-frequency (< 1 Hz) power of the EEG. HIE was defined by following the patients' recovery for six months. In patients without HIE (N = 6), propofol substantially increased (244 ± 91%, mean ± SD) the slow wave activity in forehead electrodes, whereas the patients with HIE (N = 4) were unable to produce such activity. The results received with forehead electrodes were similar to those of the full EEG cap. With the experimental pilot study data, the forehead electrodes were as capable as the full EEG cap in capturing the effect of HIE on propofol-induced slow wave activity. The finding offers potential in developing a clinically practical method for the early detection of HIE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30788811/

We reviewed our database to identify all patients undergoing endovascular procedures between January 1, 2014 and January 1, 2016. Awake patients were tested with SSEP, EEG and real time neurologic examination while TcMEPs were performed in all anesthetized patients. BAEPs were performed in anesthetized patients if indicated. Methohexital was administered as an injection at a dose of 5 mg or 10 mg and repeat testing was performed if needed.Sixty-three endovascular procedures that met criteria were performed in 32 patients. 54 procedures in 28 patients were performed under general anesthesia, 9 procedures in 4 patients were performed in wakefulness. PT was negative in 61 procedures and subsequently completed embolizations without neurological sequelae. In two cases, the testing was positive and the procedure was terminated without embolization in one patient. The other patient underwent embolization at an alternative site without repeat PT. There were no new postoperative neurologic deficits after any of these procedures. Specificity of PT was 100% as none of the patients with a negative provocative test developed a new postoperative neurologic deficit after embolization.

Sixty patients (age 18-70 years) were recruited. Exclusion criteria included history of epilepsy, neurological or neurosurgical diseases, pre-existing EPs in initial EEG recordings, medication interfering with EEG patterns. Patients were randomly allocated into three different groups: A (sevoflurane, increasing concentrations technique); B (sevoflurane, vital capacity technique); C (intravenous propofol). The clinical and instrumental monitoring included arterial blood pressure, heart rate, standard electrocardiography II, arterial oxygen saturation, facial electromyography, fraction of inspired sevoflurane, fraction of expired sevoflurane, minimal alveolar concentration of sevoflurane, and BIS.
Neurophysiological analysis of EEGs showed different EPs: polyspikes (PS), rhythmic polyspikes (PSR), and periodic epileptiform discharges (PED). EPs (p < 0.05) were observed in Group A (56%) and Group B (37%), but not in Group C. One patient in group B presented with clinical seizures. No significant differences in the vital parameters and anaesthesia parameters between groups was observed, regardless of the presence of EPs, which were associated with both low and more likely high (falsely indicating awakening from anaesthesia) BIS scores.

To assess whether EEG-guided anesthetic administration decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium.
Randomized clinical trial of 1232 adults aged 60 years and older undergoing major surgery and receiving general anesthesia at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St Louis. Recruitment was from January 2015 to May 2018, with follow-up until July 2018.
Patients were randomized 1:1 (stratified by cardiac vs noncardiac surgery and positive vs negative recent fall history) to receive EEG-guided anesthetic administration (n = 614) or usual anesthetic care (n = 618).
The primary outcome was incident delirium during postoperative days 1 through 5. Intraoperative measures included anesthetic concentration, EEG suppression, and hypotension. Adverse events included undesirable intraoperative movement, intraoperative awareness with recall, postoperative nausea and vomiting, medical complications, and death.
Of the 1232 randomized patients (median age, 69 years [range, 60 to 95]; 563 women [45.7%]), 1213 (98.5%) were assessed for the primary outcome. Delirium during postoperative days 1 to 5 occurred in 157 of 604 patients (26.0%) in the guided group and 140 of 609 patients (23.0%) in the usual care group (difference, 3.0% [95% CI, -2.0% to 8.0%]; P = .22). Median end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentration was significantly lower in the guided group than the usual care group (0.69 vs 0.80 minimum alveolar concentration; difference, -0.11 [95% CI, -0.13 to -0.10), and median cumulative time with EEG suppression was significantly less (7 vs 13 minutes; difference, -6.0 [95% CI, -9.9 to -2.1]). There was no significant difference between groups in the median cumulative time with mean arterial pressure below 60 mm Hg (7 vs 7 minutes; difference, 0.0 [95% CI, -1.7 to 1.7]). Undesirable movement occurred in 137 patients (22.3%) in the guided and 95 (15.4%) in the usual care group. No patients reported intraoperative awareness. Postoperative nausea and vomiting was reported in 48 patients (7.8%) in the guided and 55 patients (8.9%) in the usual care group. Serious adverse events were reported in 124 patients (20.2%) in the guided and 130 (21.0%) in the usual care group. Within 30 days of surgery, 4 patients (0.65%) in the guided group and 19 (3.07%) in the usual care group died.
Among older adults undergoing major surgery, EEG-guided anesthetic administration, compared with usual care, did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium. This finding does not support the use of EEG-guided anesthetic administration for this indication.

Hence, we aim to evaluate the existence of changes of diverse EEG-derived measures in deeply-sedated (RASS-Richmond agitation-sedation scale  -4 and  -5) neurocritically ill patients, and also whether sedation doses are related with those eventual changes.
We performed an observational prospective cohort study in the intensive care unit of the Hospital de la Princesa. Twenty-six adult patients suffered from traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage were included in the present study. Long-term continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings (2141 h) and hourly annotated information were used to determine the relationship between intravenous sedation infusion doses and network and spectral EEG measures. To do that, two different strategies were followed: assessment of the statistical dependence between both variables using the Spearman correlation rank and by performing an automatic classification method based on a machine learning algorithm.
More than 60% of patients presented a correlation greater than 0.5 in at least one of the calculated EEG measures with the sedation dose. The automatic classification method presented an accuracy of 84.3% in discriminating between different sedation doses. In both cases the nodes' degree was the most relevant measurement.

Both the international TSC consensus conference in 2012, and the panel of European experts in 2012 and 2018 have concluded that surgery should be considered for medically refractory TSC patients. However, surgery remains currently underutilized in TSC. Case series, meta-analyses and guidelines all agree that a 50 to 60% chance of long-term seizure freedom can be achieved after surgery in TSC patients and a presurgical work-up should be done as early as possible after failure of two appropriate AEDs. The presence of infantile spasms, the second most common seizure type in TSC, had initially been a barrier to surgical planning but is now no longer considered a contraindication for surgery in TSC patients. TSC patients undergoing presurgical evaluation range from those with few tubers and good anatomo-electro-clinical correlations to patients with a significant ""tuber burden"" in whom the limits of the epileptogenic zone is much more difficult to define. Direct surgery is often possible in patients with a good electro-clinical and MRI correlation. For more complex cases, invasive monitoring is often mandatory and bilateral investigations can be necessary. Multiple non-invasive tools have been shown to be helpful in determining the placement of these invasive electrodes and in planning the resection scheme. Additionally, at an individual level, multimodality imaging can assist in identifying the epileptogenic zone. Increased availability of investigations that can be performed without sedation in young and/or cognitively impaired children such as MEG and HR EEG would most probably be of great benefit in the TSC population. Of those selected for invasive EEG, rates of seizure freedom following surgery are close to cases where invasive monitoring is not required, strengthening the important and efficient role of intracranial investigations in drug-resistant TSC associated epilepsy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30686486/

These monitors use ratios of high to low frequency power which assumes that each neurological process contributes a unique frequency pattern. However, recent research of the effect of deep brain stimulation on EEG beta oscillations suggests that wave shape, a non-sinusoidal feature that is only measurable in the time-domain, can change the frequency 'signature' of a neurological rhythmical process by the inclusion or removal of harmonic frequencies. If wave shape variations are present in the EEG of anaesthetised patients, then quantitative EEG monitors likely overestimate the anaesthetic drug effect. The purpose of this paper is to investigate alpha-wave shape in the EEG of anaesthetised patients and demonstrate the effect of wave shape on the frequency ratios that are commonly utilised in the BIS quantitative EEG monitor. EEG data, demographic information, and surgery details were collected prospectively from 305 patients undergoing a general anaesthetic for elective surgery. Alpha-wave shape was categorised by triangularity of the EEG extrema, a measure of how peaked (towards a sawtooth wave) or flat (towards a square wave) the extremum was. The alpha-wave was then artificially modified to either a sawtooth wave or square wave, and BetaRatio and PowerFastSlow metrics calculated. Age was found to be the only significant predictor of alpha wave triangularity. The artificially modified square-alpha waves increased the power in the frequency spectrum at 26 Hz by 1-5 dB, and increased the BetaRatio by 0.7. The alpha-wave of anaesthetised patients contains non-sinusoidal components which likely impact depth of anaesthesia calculations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30671894/

Five common brain functional network patterns were identified across all conscious levels. The occurrence of each meta-stable network pattern was associated with the level of anesthesia. A transition functional network pattern was found to transfer to the anesthesia dominating or wakefulness dominating network pattern depending on the conscious level. Furthermore, a functional network pattern persisted during both wakefulness and anesthesia is found to be supported by the anatomical connectivity.

30639398,Changes of auditory stimulus processing in sevoflurane-induced sedation.,Neuroscience letters,2019,"Kim JW, Kim PJ, Kim HG, Shin TJ","Despite the widespread use in clinical practice, little research has been done on mechanisms of sedation. In particular, little is known about the changes in the information processing of external stimuli in sedation. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of event-related potential (ERP) in auditory passive oddball paradigm when the sedation was induced by sevoflurane inhalation. Electroencephalography (EEG) measurements were obtained for each subject using 32-channel EEG recording devices. Sevoflurane was administered at an initial concentration of 0.8 vol% to induce sedative state. Auditory stimulation based on the passive oddball paradigm was delivered to the subject via an earphone before and after sevoflurane administration. After ERP was extracted from the measured EEG, the topographic distribution of ERP, the temporal changes of ERP in each channel, and the statistical difference in ERP between awake and sedation were analyzed. In the awake state, P300 was observed at 320-360 ms latency, and P300 was concentrated in the frontal and central area. P300 amplitude was significantly decreased in sedation compared to awake. Sevoflurane-induced sedation caused a decrease in P300 amplitude. This result may reflect the weakening of the cognitive function governing attentional process and stimuli discrimination during sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30639398/

However, reliable, easily acquirable and interpretable neurophysiological markers of the presence of consciousness in unresponsive states are still missing. A promising marker is based on the decay-rate of the power spectral density (PSD) of the resting EEG. We acquired resting electroencephalogram (EEG) in three groups of healthy participants (n = 5 each), before and during anesthesia induced by either xenon, propofol or ketamine. Dosage of each anesthetic agent was tailored to yield unresponsiveness (Ramsay score = 6). Delayed subjective reports assessed whether conscious experience was present ('Conscious report') or absent/inaccessible to recall ('No Report'). We estimated the decay of the PSD of the resting EEG-after removing oscillatory peaks-via the spectral exponent β, for a broad band (1-40 Hz) and narrower sub-bands (1-20 Hz, 20-40 Hz). Within-subject anesthetic changes in β were assessed. Furthermore, based on β, 'Conscious report' states were discriminated against 'no report' states. Finally, we evaluated the correlation of the resting spectral exponent with a recently proposed index of consciousness, the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI), derived from a previous TMS-EEG study. The spectral exponent of the resting EEG discriminated states in which consciousness was present (wakefulness, ketamine) from states where consciousness was reduced or abolished (xenon, propofol). Loss of consciousness substantially decreased the (negative) broad-band spectral exponent in each subject undergoing xenon or propofol anesthesia-indexing an overall steeper PSD decay. Conversely, ketamine displayed an overall PSD decay similar to that of wakefulness-consistent with the preservation of consciousness-yet it showed a flattening of the decay in the high-frequencies (20-40 Hz)-consistent with its specific mechanism of action. The spectral exponent was highly correlated to PCI, corroborating its interpretation as a marker of the presence of consciousness. A steeper PSD of the resting EEG reliably indexed unconsciousness in anesthesia, beyond sheer unresponsiveness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30639334/

Our goal was to use electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether valerian root extract (VRE) affects resting-state connectivity changes and whether such changes are associated with clinical symptoms. This 4-week, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 64 nonclinical volunteers suffering psychological stress. The participants received VRE (100 mg) or a placebo thrice daily. We examined VRE's therapeutic effects on anxiety and stress-related psychological constructs. Functional brain connectivity changes were measured as EEG coherence in the alpha and theta frequency bands. The VRE and placebo groups both exhibited significant postintervention improvements on all clinical scales, but no significant between-group differences in these changes were noted. Compared with the placebo group, the VRE group exhibited significantly greater increases in frontal brain region alpha coherence across four electrode pairs, and these changes were significantly correlated with anxiolysis. The VRE group also exhibited significantly greater decreases in theta coherence across another four electrodes pairs. Our findings indicate that VRE alters functional brain connectivity in relation to anxiety.

Various nursing interventions performed when caring for these patients may elicit pathological cerebral electrical activity including seizures and stimulus-induced rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs). The aim was to explore changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) due to neurointensive care nursing interventions.
A convenience sample was recruited between November 2015 and April 2016, consisting of 12 adult patients with impaired consciousness due to a neurosurgical condition. Continuous EEG and simultaneous video recordings of nursing interventions were collected 48 continuous hours for each patient. Two analysts categorized the video recordings for common nursing interventions, and a neurophysiologist analyzed the EEGs.
In total, 976 nursing interventions were observed. Epileptiform activity was observed in 4 patients (33%), during 1 nursing intervention episode each (0.4%). The 4 observed episodes of epileptiform activity occurred during multiple simultaneous nursing interventions (n = 3) and hygienic interventions (n = 1). Stimulus-induced rhythmic, periodic, or ictal discharges were observed in 1 patient (8%), in 1 single nursing intervention (0.1%). The observed SIRPIDs occurred during repositioning of the patient. All patients had muscle artifacts, during 353 nursing interventions (36.3%). The duration of nursing interventions was longer for those with simultaneous muscle artifacts (median, 116 seconds) than those without muscle artifacts, epileptiform activity, or SIRPIDs (median, 89.0 seconds). With regard to epileptiform activity and SIRPIDs, the median durations of the nursing interventions were 1158 and 289 seconds, respectively.
The results of this pilot study indicate that muscle artifacts seem prevalent during nursing interventions and may be a sign of stress. Nurses should be aware of the risk of inducing stress by performing regular nursing interventions in daily practice, consider shorter or fewer interventions at a time in sensitive patients, and administer sedation accordingly. Considering that this was a pilot study, more research that investigates correlations between EEG patterns and nursing interventions in larger samples is needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30614933/

Conversely, EMG seems necessary to constitute the high BIS indicative of an awake condition, and may play a fundamental role in calculating BIS, rather than distorting the appropriate BIS. However, exactly how EMG is associated with a high BIS remains unclear. We intended to clarify the respective contributions of EMG and various electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters to high BIS. In 79 courses of anaesthesia, BIS monitor-derived EMG parameters (EMGLOW), and other processed EEG parameters [SEF95 (spectral edge frequency 95%), SynchFastSlow (bispectral parameter), BetaRatio (frequency parameter), total power subtypes in five frequency range], were obtained simultaneously with BIS, every 3 s. These EEG parameters were used for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of detecting three BIS levels (BIS > 80, BIS > 70, and BIS > 60) to assess their diagnosabilities. A total of 218,418 data points derived from 79 cases were used for analysis. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated and optimal cut-off (threshold) was determined by Youden index. As the results, for detecting BIS > 80, the AUC of EMGLOW was 0.975 [0.974-0.977] (mean [95% confidence interval]), significantly higher than any other processed EEG parameters such as BetaRatio (0.832 [0.828-0.835]), SEF95 (0.821 [0.817-0.826]) and SynchFastSlow (0.769 [0.764-0.774]) (p < 0.05 each). The threshold of EMGLOW for detecting BIS > 80 was 35.7 dB, with high sensitivity (92.5%) and high specificity (96.5%).

An interdisciplinary module was implemented over 7 years in one institution to strengthen anesthesiology residents' EEG education. This study researched the module's outcome by evaluating participants' specific performance on EEG-related questions (keywords) through independent testing, i.e., the in-training examinations (ITEs).
Residency program ITE performance reports from 2002 to 2014 were searched for EEG keyword items. The ITE uses images for assessment. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate differences in the composite performance (mean percent correct on EEG-related keywords) of anesthesiology trainees from their clinical anesthesia year 1 (CA-1) to their clinical anesthesia year 3 (CA-3) who received the education module and compared with those who did not receive the training module, as well as compared with the national average for the corresponding training level.
Residents who received the education module (mean percent correct = 83.3%, 95% CI: 74.0-92.7) performed significantly better than residents within the same program who did not receive the module (P = 0.04; mean difference = 22.0%, 95% CI: 1.0-43.0), as well as national residents on the same keywords (P = 0.01; mean difference = 23.4%, 95% CI: 3.9-42.9).

Although consciousness is usually maintained during sedation, strictly speaking, the sedative state is different from consciousness. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used widely to sedate patients for dental procedures. However, its mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze the extent of disturbance in the integration of brain activities during N2O administration on the basis of projection to the reconstructed state space. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were obtained from 15 patients undergoing N2O (50%) administration. The correlation dimension in the reconstructed state space was quantified and correlation dimensions were compared according to consciousness levels (awake state vs. sedative state induced by N2O). The correlation dimension of alpha and gamma band EEG in the sedative state showed statistical significance at around 15 and 5 of the embedding dimension during N2O administration. The difference was the most prominent in alpha band EEG. This result indicates that the sedative state shows a higher dimensional trajectory in the reconstructed state space that is brain band specific. These data also indicate that the dimensional dynamic property has a different pattern during sedation induced by N2O compared with that at the awake state. The disturbance in information integration may explain the mild cognitive disturbance of N2O.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30531273/

Similar functional connectivity patterns derived from resting state empirical data and brain network models at criticality provide further support. However, despite the strong implication of a relationship, there has been no principled explanation of how criticality shapes the characteristic functional connectivity in large-scale brain networks. Here, we hypothesized that the network science concept of partial phase locking is the underlying mechanism of optimal functional connectivity in the resting state. We further hypothesized that the characteristic connectivity of the critical state provides a theoretical boundary to quantify how far pharmacologically or pathologically perturbed brain connectivity deviates from its critical state, which could enable the differentiation of various states of consciousness with a theory-based metric. To test the hypothesis, we used a neuroanatomically informed brain network model with the resulting source signals projected to electroencephalogram (EEG)-like sensor signals with a forward model. Phase lag entropy (PLE), a measure of phase relation diversity, was estimated and the topography of PLE was analyzed. To measure the distance from criticality, the PLE topography at a critical state was compared with those of the EEG data from baseline consciousness, isoflurane anesthesia, ketamine anesthesia, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, and minimally conscious state. We demonstrate that the partial phase locking at criticality shapes the functional connectivity and asymmetric anterior-posterior PLE topography, with low (high) PLE for high (low) degree nodes. The topographical similarity and the strength of PLE differentiates various pharmacologic and pathologic states of consciousness. Moreover, this model-based EEG network analysis provides a novel metric to quantify how far a pharmacologically or pathologically perturbed brain network is away from critical state, rather than merely determining whether it is in a critical or non-critical state.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30529630/

We discuss recent perioperative EEG investigations relating to aging and cognitive dysfunction, and their implications on intraoperative EEG neuromonitoring in elderly patients.
The incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly can be reduced by monitoring depth of anesthesia, using an index number (0-100) derived from processed frontal EEG readings. The recently published European Society of Anaesthesiology guideline on postoperative delirium in elderly now recommends guiding general anesthesia with such indices (Level A). However, intraoperative EEG signatures are heavily influenced by age, cognitive function, and choice of anesthetic agents. Detailed spectral EEG analysis and research on EEG-based functional connectivity provide new insights into the pathophysiology of neuronal excitability, which is seen in elderly patients with postoperative delirium.
Anesthesiologists should become acquainted with intraoperative EEG signatures and their relation to age, anesthetic agents, and the risk of postoperative cognitive complications. A working knowledge would allow an optimized and individualized provision of general anesthesia for the elderly.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30507680/

Whether burst-suppression causes POD or merely reflects susceptibility to POD is unclear. We hypothesized decreased intraoperative alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-33 Hz) power prior to the occurrence of burst-suppression in susceptible patients.
We analyzed intraoperative electroencephalogram data of cardiac surgical patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We detected the incidence and duration of CPB burst-suppression with an automated burst-suppression detection algorithm. We analyzed EEG data with multitaper spectral estimation methods. We assessed associations between patient characteristics and burst-suppression using Binomial and Zero-inflated Poisson Regression Models.
We found significantly decreased alpha and beta power (7.8-22.95 Hz) in the CPB burst-suppression cohort. The odds ratio for the association between point estimates for alpha and beta power (7.8-22.95 Hz) and the incidence of burst-suppression was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.79-0.98). The incidence rate ratio for the association between point estimates for power between the alpha and beta range and the duration of burst-suppression was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84-0.93).
Decreased intra-operative power within the alpha and beta range was associated with susceptibility to burst-suppression during CPB.

However, measuring the P300 in patients is complicated by significant inter-trial variability commonly observed in levels of arousal and awareness. To overcome this limitation, we analyzed single-trial modulation of power in the delta and theta frequency bands, which underlie the P300.
In a preliminary cross-sectional study using a 24-channel EEG and a passive own-name oddball paradigm, we analyzed event-related synchronization (ERS) across trials in the delta and theta bands in a sample of 10 control and 12 DoC subjects.
In comparison to controls, DoC subjects presented a low percentage of trials where delta ERS was observed. In particular, coordinated modulation between delta and theta in response to the stimulus was absent, with a high percentage of trials where only theta ERS was observed. Further, we found a positive correlation between the percentage of epochs with delta ERS and the strength of the P300.
Reduced modulation of spectral activity in the delta band in response to stimuli indicates a dissociation in the activity of the neural networks that oscillate in delta and theta ranges and contribute to the generation of the P300.
The reduction in spectral modulation observed in DoC provides a deeper understanding of neurophysiological dysfunction and the means to develop a more fine-grained marker of residual cognitive function in individual patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30458356/

Despite this, few studies have assessed the feasibility and utility of recording simultaneous EEG/fMRI in a drug study.
We used simultaneous EEG/fMRI to assess the modulation of neural activity by ketamine and midazolam, in a placebo-controlled, single-blind, three-way cross-over design. Specifically, we analysed the sensitivity and direction of the spectral effects of each modality and the temporal correlations between the modulations of power of the common EEG bands and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal.
Demonstrating feasibility, local spectral effects were similar to those found in previous non-simultaneous EEG and fMRI studies. Ketamine administration resulted in a widespread reduction of BOLD fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and a diverse pattern of effects in the different EEG bands. Midazolam increased fALFF in occipital, parietal, and temporal areas, and frontal delta and beta EEG power. While EEG spectra were more sensitive to pharmacological modulations than the fALFF bands, there was no clear spatial relationship between the two modalities. Additionally, ketamine modulated the temporal correlation strengths between the theta EEG band and the BOLD signal, whereas midazolam altered temporal correlations with the alpha and beta bands. Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of simultaneous recording: each modality provides unique insights, and combinatorial analyses elicit more information than separate recordings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30426183/

Conscious experience may be absent (unconsciousness) or take the form of dreaming, a state in which sensory stimuli are not incorporated into conscious experience (disconnected consciousness). Recent work has identified features of cortical activity that distinguish conscious from unconscious states; however, less is known about how cortical activity differs between disconnected states and normal wakefulness. We employed transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) over parietal regions across states of anesthesia and sleep to assess whether evoked oscillatory activity differed in disconnected states. We hypothesized that alpha activity, which may regulate perception of sensory stimuli, is altered in the disconnected states of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and ketamine anesthesia. Compared to wakefulness, evoked alpha power (8-12 Hz) was decreased during disconnected consciousness. In contrast, in unconscious states of propofol anesthesia and non-REM (NREM) sleep, evoked low-gamma power (30-40 Hz) was decreased compared to wakefulness or states of disconnected consciousness. These findings were confirmed in subjects in which dream reports were obtained following serial awakenings from NREM sleep. By examining signatures of evoked cortical activity across conscious states, we identified novel evidence that suppression of evoked alpha activity may represent a promising marker of sensory disconnection.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30413741/

RSE occurred in 36 patients (21.7%) and was treated with an aggressive standardized protocol as long as multimodal prognostic indicators were not unfavorable. RSE started after 3 ± 2.3 days after cardiac arrest and lasted 4.7 ± 4.3 days. A benign EEG pattern was recorded in 76 patients (45.8%); a periodic pattern (GPDs) was seen in 13 patients (7.8%); and a malignant nonepileptiform EEG pattern was recorded in 41 patients (24.7%). The 4 EEG patterns were highly associated with different prognostic indicators (low-flow time, clinical motor seizures, N20 responses, neuron-specific enolase, neuroimaging). Survival and good neurologic outcome (CPC 1 or 2) at 6 months were 72.4% and 71.1% for benign EEG pattern, 54.3% and 44.4% for RSE, 15.4% and 0% for GPDs, and 2.4% and 0% for malignant nonepileptiform EEG pattern, respectively.
Aggressive and prolonged treatment of RSE may be justified in patients with cardiac arrest with favorable multimodal prognostic indicators.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30381366/
30379935,Variability in pharmacologically-induced coma for treatment of refractory status epilepticus.,PloS one,2018,"An J, Jonnalagadda D, Moura V, Purdon PL, Brown EN, Westover MB","To characterize the amount of EEG suppression achieved in refractory status epilepticus (RSE) patients treated with pharmacologically-induced coma (PIC).
We analyzed EEG recordings from 35 RSE patients between 21-84 years-old who received PIC that target burst suppression and quantified the amount of EEG suppression using the burst suppression probability (BSP). Then we measured the variability of BSPs with respect to a reference level of BSP 0.8 ± 0.15. Finally, we also measured the variability of BSPs with respect to the amount of intravenous anesthetic drugs (IVADs) received by the patients.
Patients remained in the reference BSP range for only 8% (median, interquartile range IQR [0, 29] %) of the total time under treatment. The median time with BSP below the reference range was 84% (IQR [37, 100] %). BSPs in some patients drifted significantly over time despite constant infusion rates of IVADs. Similar weight-normalized infusion rates of IVADs in different patients nearly always resulted in distinct BSPs (probability 0.93 (IQR [0.82, 1.0]).
This study quantitatively identified high variability in the amount of EEG suppression achieved in clinical practice when treating RSE patients. While some of this variability may arise from clinicians purposefully deviating from clinical practice guidelines, our results show that the high variability also arises in part from significant inter- and intra- individual pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variation. Our results indicate that the delicate balance between maintaining sufficient EEG suppression in RSE patients and minimizing IVAD exposure in clinical practice is challenging to achieve. This may affect patient outcomes and confound studies seeking to determine an optimal amount of EEG suppression for treatment of RSE. Therefore, our analysis points to the need for developing an alternative paradigm, such as vigilant anesthetic management as happens in operating rooms, or closed-loop anesthesia delivery, for investigating and providing induced-coma therapy to RSE patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30379935/

The primary aim of this prospective observational study, performed in a tertiary children's hospital, was to identify the clinical applicability and validity of density spectral array monitoring in infants and children during sevoflurane anaesthesia. We included 104 children, aged < 6 years, undergoing elective surgery during sevoflurane anaesthesia. We investigated the correlation between non-steady state end-tidal sevoflurane and the expression of the four electroencephalogram frequency bands β, α, θ and δ, representing density spectral array. Patients were divided into three age groups (< 6 months, 6-12 months, > 12 months). There was a significant correlation between end-tidal sevoflurane and density spectral array in the age groups 6-12 months (p < 0.05) and 1-6 years (p < 0.0001). In infants < 6 months of age, the relative percentages of density spectral array did not correlate with end-tidal sevoflurane. The main finding was that different end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane produce age-dependent changes in the density spectral array power spectrum. In infants younger than 6 months-old, α and β coherence are absent, whereas θ and δ oscillations have already emerged. In cases where anaesthesia was too deep, this presented as burst suppression on the electroencephalogram, θ disappeared, leaving the electroencephalographic activity in the δ range. Future research should address this issue, aiming to clarify whether the emergence of θ oscillations in infants helps to prevent sevoflurane overdosing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30367683/

With increased focus on detecting the anesthesia states of patients in the course of surgery, more attention has been paid to analyzing the power spectra and entropy measures of EEG signal during anesthesia. In this paper, by using the relative power of EEG frequency bands and the EEG entropy measures, a new method for detecting the depth of anesthesia states has been presented based on the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers. EEG signals were recorded from 20 patients before, during and after general anesthesia in the operating room at a sampling rate of 200 Hz. Then, 12 features were extracted from each EEG segment, 10 s in length, which are used for anesthesia state monitoring. No significant difference was observed (p > 0.05) between these features and the bispectral index (BIS), which is the commonly used measure of anesthetic effect. The used LS-SVM classifier based method is able to identify the anesthesia states with an accuracy of 80% with reference to the BIS index. Since the underlying equation of the utilized LS-SVM is linear, the computational time of the algorithm is not significant and therefore it can be used for online application in operation rooms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30338496/

We hypothesised that the reduced current propagation under propofol-induced unresponsiveness is associated with changes in both feedforward and feedback connectivity across the cortical hierarchy.
Eight subjects underwent left occipital TMS coupled with high-density EEG recordings during wakefulness and propofol-induced unconsciousness. Spectral analysis was applied to responses recorded from sensors overlying six hierarchical cortical sources involved in visual processing. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of induced time-frequency responses and evoked response potentials were used to investigate propofol's effects on connectivity between regions.
Sensor space analysis demonstrated that propofol reduced both induced and evoked power after TMS in occipital, parietal, and frontal electrodes. Bayesian model selection supported a DCM with hierarchical feedforward and feedback connections. DCM of induced EEG responses revealed that the primary effect of propofol was impaired feedforward responses in cross-frequency theta/alpha-gamma coupling and within frequency theta coupling (F contrast, family-wise error corrected P<0.05). An exploratory analysis (thresholded at uncorrected P<0.001) also suggested that propofol impaired feedforward and feedback beta band coupling. Post hoc analyses showed impairments in all feedforward connections and one feedback connection from parietal to occipital cortex. DCM of the evoked response potential showed impaired feedforward connectivity between left-sided occipital and parietal cortex (T contrast P=0.004, Bonferroni corrected).

Techniques were developed to obtain electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from freely moving subjects performing navigational tasks using the RNS
Task synchronization using the synchronization marker technique provides a quantitative measure of clock uncertainty, and can align data to task events with less than 4 ms of uncertainty. Hippocampal ECoG activity was found to change immediately before an incorrect response to a math problem compared to hippocampal activity before a correct response. In addition, subjects were found to have variable but significant changes in theta band power in the hippocampus during navigation compared to when subjects were not navigating. We found that there is theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in the right hippocampus while subjects stand still during a navigation task.
An alignment technique described in this study improves the upper bound on task-ECoG alignment uncertainty from approximately 30 ms to under 4 ms. The RNS System is one of the first platforms capable of providing untethered ambulatory ECoG recording in humans, allowing for the study of real world instead of virtual navigation. Compared to intracranial video EEG studies, studies using the RNS System platform are not subject to confounds caused by the drugs and recent surgery inherent to the perioperative environment. Furthermore, these subjects provide the opportunity to record from the same electrodes over the course of many years.
The RNS System enables us to study human navigation with unprecedented clarity. While RNS System patients have fewer electrodes implanted than video EEG patients, the lack of external artifact and confounds from recent surgery make this system a useful tool to further human electrophysiology research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30267724/

Fifteen men aged >60 years (mean, 70 years) were selected. Propofol target-controlled infusion was performed under EEG bispectral index monitoring. The propofol target effect-site concentration, blood pressure, heart rate, and distributions and powers of the EEG spectrum were recorded in an awake state and under anesthesia. The EEG included seven bands: delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (4.0-7.0 Hz), alpha-1 (7.5-9.5 Hz), alpha-2 (10-12 Hz), beta-1 (13-23 Hz), beta-2 (24-34 Hz), and gamma (35-45 Hz).
From an awake state to anesthesia, the brain topographic map showed that the energies of delta, theta, alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta-1 were concentrated in the frontoparietal site, and the power increased significantly. The energy distribution of beta-2 was significantly decreased and the power significantly reduced. The energy distribution of gamma in the temporal lobe was also markedly decreased and the power significantly reduced.

Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) is a type of quantitative EEG and is easily interpreted by a non-neurologist. A few studies have shown the effectiveness of aEEG in prognostication among adult patients post cardiac arrest. In this study, we hypothesized that the pattern of aEEG after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) could successfully categorize patients post cardiac arrest according to their expected neurological outcome.
We assessed the comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who received targeted temperature management with midazolam-based sedation and were monitored with aEEG at our tertiary emergency care center from January 2013 to June 2017. We categorized the patients into categories 1 (C1) to 4 (C4). C1 included patients who regained continuous normal voltage (CNV) within 12 h post ROSC, C2 included those who recovered CNV 12-36 h post ROSC, C3 included those who did not recover CNV before 36 h post ROSC, and C4 included those who had burst suppression at any time post ROSC. We evaluated the outcomes of neurological function for each category at hospital discharge. A good outcome was defined as a cerebral performance category of 1 or 2.
A total of 61 patients were assessed (median age, 60 years), among whom 42 (70%) had an initial shockable rhythm, and 52 (85%) had cardiac etiology. Of all 61 patients, 40 (66%) survived to hospital discharge and 27 (44%) had a good neurological outcome. Of 20 patients in C1, 19 (95%) had a good outcome, while the percentage dropped to 57% among C2 patients. No patients in C3 or C4 had a good outcome. Three patients could not be classified into any category.
The pattern of aEEG during the early post-cardiac-arrest period can successfully categorize patients according to their neurological prognoses and could be used as a potential guide to customize post-cardiac-arrest care for each patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30236137/

Off-label use of Bispectral Index within context and limitations for conditions other than depth of anesthesia.,Minerva anestesiologica,2019,Dahaba AA,"Numerous articles appeared in literature using brain function monitors (BFM), such as Bispectral Index (BIS) to assess cerebral cognitive conditions not related to depth of anesthesia. BIS cannot be considered a ""true"" reflection of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal nor an independent measure of brain function. BIS algorithm was retrospectively derived from EEG changes with incremental doses of γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)ergic anesthetic agents while measuring 3 descriptors. In many instances we are confronted with BIS values that do not concur with clinically judged anesthetic state arising from an underlying alteration of the patients' own EEG. Because BIS is an EEG derived parameter; conditions that can ""alter"" the raw EEG signal would subsequently change BIS to reflect other unrelated EEG events of patient-dependent pathophysiologic perturbations. Could we use BIS monitor outside the scope of the operating room to ""grade"" other EEG conditions? Actually the answer to that seems to be a ""very cautious"" yes. Because BIS is a rather appealing scale from 100 to 0, it is tempting to find numerical cut-off values for conditions that are already clinically graded like West Haven hepatic encephalopathy. Having said that I strongly argue against going as far as using BIS in Critical Care Unit (CCU) setting, there are too much heterogeneity and many disease states in the CCU patients, other than sedatives /hypnotics, that would strongly influence BIS values, in effect rendering BIS not only useless most of the time but can also be misleading.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30226034/

However, studies analysing the impact of epileptiform discharges on postoperative emergence delirium in children are still scarce. The aim of this study is to correlate the incidence of epileptiform activity during anaesthesia induction with the occurrence of emergence delirium during stay in the recovery room.
Prospective, observational cohort study in children 0.5 to 8 years old undergoing planned surgery. Bifrontal electroencephalogram electrodes were placed before induction of anaesthesia. Visual electroencephalogram analysis was performed from start of anaesthetic agent administration until intubation with regard to epileptiform patterns: rhythmic polyspikes; periodic epileptiform discharges; delta with spikes; and suppression with spikes.

It mainly targets brain status and communication, thus providing potential to trace differences in the brain's activity under different anesthetics. In this article, two kinds of gamma-amino butyric acid (type A -GABAA) dependent anesthetic agents, propofol and desflurane (28 and 23 patients), were studied and compared with respect to EEG spectrogram dynamics. Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) was employed to compute the time varying spectrum for different anesthetic levels in comparison with Fourier based method. Results show that the HHT method generates consistent band power (slow and alpha) dominance pattern as Fourier method does, but exhibits higher concentrated power distribution within each frequency band than the Fourier method during both drugs induced unconsciousness. HHT also finds slow and theta bands peak frequency with better convergence by standard deviation (propofol-slow: 0.46 to 0.24; theta: 1.42 to 0.79; desflurane-slow: 0.30 to 0.25; theta: 1.42 to 0.98) and a shift to relatively lower values for alpha band (propofol: 9.94 Hz to 10.33 Hz, desflurane 8.44 Hz to 8.84 Hz) than Fourier one. For different stage comparisons, although HHT shows significant alpha power increases during unconsciousness stage as the Fourier did previously, it finds no significant high frequency (low gamma) band power difference in propofol whereas it does in desflurane. In addition, when comparing the HHT results within two groups during unconsciousness, high beta band power in propofol is significantly larger than that of desflurane while delta band power behaves oppositely. In conclusion, this study convincingly shows that EEG analyzed here considerably differs between the HHT and Fourier method.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30112395/

How the brain reaches this state spontaneously is not known. General anesthesia provides a unique opportunity to examine how the human brain recovers its functional capabilities after profound unconsciousness. We used intracranial electrocorticography and scalp EEG in humans to track neural dynamics during emergence from propofol general anesthesia. We identify a distinct transient brain state that occurs immediately prior to recovery of behavioral responsiveness. This state is characterized by large, spatially distributed, slow sensory-evoked potentials that resemble the K-complexes that are hallmarks of stage two sleep. However, the ongoing spontaneous dynamics in this transitional state differ from sleep.

30076488,A Blind Module Identification Approach for Predicting Effective Connectivity Within Brain Dynamical Subnetworks.,Brain topography,2019,"Karameh FN, Nahas Z","Model-based network discovery measures, such as the brain effective connectivity, require fitting of generative process models to measurements obtained from key areas across the network. For distributed dynamic phenomena, such as generalized seizures and slow-wave sleep, studying effective connectivity from real-time recordings is significantly complicated since (i) outputs from only a subnetwork can be practically measured, and (ii) exogenous subnetwork inputs are unobservable. Model fitting, therefore, constitutes a challenging blind module identification or model inversion problem for finding both the parameters and the many unknown inputs of the subnetwork. We herein propose a novel estimation framework for identifying nonlinear dynamic subnetworks in the case of slowly-varying, otherwise unknown local inputs. Starting with approximate predictions obtained using Cubature Kalman filtering, residuals of local output predictions are utilized to improve upon local input estimates. The algorithm performance is tested on both simulated and clinical EEG of induced seizures under electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). For the simulated network, the algorithm significantly boosted the estimation accuracy for inputs and connections from noisy EEG. For the clinical data, the algorithm predicted increased subnetwork inputs during the pre-stimulus anesthesia condition. Importantly, it predicted an increased frontocentral connectivity during the generalized seizure that is commensurate with electrode placement and that corroborates the clinical hypothesis of increased frontal focality of therapeutic ECT seizures. The proposed framework can be extended to account for several input configurations and can in principle be applied to study effective connectivity within brain subnetworks defined at the microscale (cortical lamina interaction) or at the macroscale (sensory integration).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30076488/

The importance of isoelectricity before circulatory arrest is not fully known in neonates. We compared the EEG response to DHCA in human neonates and piglets.
We recorded 2 channel, left and right centroparietal, subdermal EEG in 10 neonatal patients undergoing operations involving DHCA and 10 neonatal piglets that were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and underwent a simulated procedure using DHCA. EEG waveforms were analyzed for the presence and extent of burst suppression and isoelectricity by automated moving window analysis. The patients were monitored with 16-channel array EEG for 48 hours postoperatively and underwent postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging.
After induction of anesthesia, humans and piglets both displayed slowing or brief suppression, then mild burst suppression, and then severe burst suppression during cooling. All piglets subsequently achieved isoelectricity at 22.4° ± 6.9°C, whereas only 1 human did at 20.2°C. Piglets and humans emerged from severe, mild, and then brief suppression patterns during rewarming. Among the patients, there were no seizures during postoperative monitoring and 1 instance of increased white matter injury on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging.
Our data suggest that current cooling strategies may not be sufficient to eliminate all EEG activity before circulatory arrest in humans but are sufficient in swine.

We invited 30 international experts on EEG in patients after CA for participation in a two round Delphi study. Consensus was defined as ≥75% agreement, 66-75% agreement was included as recommendation.
In the first round 24 experts participated (80% response rate) of whom 22 finished the second round (8% drop-out). Consensus was reached on several parts of the stimulus protocol: Clapping, calling out the patient's name and nail bed pressure should be executed and each stimulus at least three times with recommended duration of at least 5 s. The patient should not be stimulated before EEG-R testing and information on sedation/analgesics should be provided. The consensus definition of EEG-R is ""A reproducible change in the EEG in response to stimulation"" and appearance of muscle-, movement- and eye blink artefacts, spinal movements and electrographic seizure induction do not qualify as reactive. Almost all respondents agreed that this consensus protocol should also be used in comatose patients with other etiologies.

According to the prospective protocol a routine EEG was performed in patients who remained comatose after the 36 h temperature control intervention. EEGs were retrospectively reviewed blinded to outcome using the standardised American Clinical Neurophysiology Society terminology. Highly malignant, malignant and benign EEG patterns were correlated to poor and good outcome, defined by best achieved Cerebral Performance Category up to 180 days.
At 20 sites 207 patients had a routine EEG performed at median 76 h after cardiac arrest. Highly malignant patterns (suppression or burst-suppression with or without discharges) had a high specificity for poor outcome (98%, CI 92-100), but with limited sensitivity (31%, CI 24-39). Our false positive patient had a burst-suppression pattern during ongoing sedation. A benign EEG, i.e. continuous normal-voltage background without malignant features, identified patients with good outcome with 77% (CI 66-86) sensitivity and 80% (CI 73-86) specificity.

30037614,"Transposable elements, placental development, and oocyte activation: Cellular stress and AMPK links jumping genes with the creation of human life.",Medical hypotheses,2018,Finley J,"Transposable elements (TEs), also known as ""jumping genes"", are DNA sequences first described by Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock that comprise nearly half of the human genome and are able to transpose or move from one genomic location to another. As McClintock also noted that a genome ""shock"" or stress may induce TE activation and transposition, accumulating evidence suggests that cellular stress (e.g. mediated by increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species [ROS] and calcium [Ca2+], etc.) induces TE mobilization in several model organisms and L1s (a member of the retrotransposon class of TEs) are active and capable of retrotransposition in human oocytes, human sperm, and in human neural progenitor cells. Cellular stress also plays a critical role in human placental development, with cytotrophoblast (CTB) differentiation leading to the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast (STB), a cellular layer that facilitates nutrient and gas exchange between the mother and the fetus. Syncytin-1, a protein that promotes fusion of CTB cells and is necessary for STB formation, and its receptor is found in human sperm and human oocytes, respectively, and increases in ROS and Ca2+ promote trophoblast differentiation and syncytin-1 expression. Cellular stress is also essential in promoting human oocyte maturation and activation which, similar to TE mobilization, can be induced by compounds that increase intracellular Ca2+ and ROS levels. AMPK is a master metabolic regulator activated by increases in ROS, Ca2+, and/or an AMP(ADP)/ATP ratio increase, etc. as well as compounds that induce L1 mobilization in human cells. AMPK knockdown inhibits trophoblast differentiation and AMPK-activating compounds that promote L1 mobility also enhance trophoblast differentiation. Cellular stressors that induce TE mobilization (e.g. heat shock) also promote oocyte maturation in an AMPK-dependent manner and the antibiotic ionomycin activates AMPK, promotes TE activation, and induces human oocyte activation, producing normal, healthy children. Metformin promotes AMPK-dependent telomerase activation (critical for telomere maintenance) and induces activation of the endonuclease RAG1 (promotes DNA cleavage and transposition) via AMPK. Both RAG1 and telomerase are derived from TEs. It is our hypothesis that cellular stress and AMPK links TE activation and transposition with placental development and oocyte activation, facilitating both human genome evolution and the creation of all human life. We also propose the novel observation that various cellular stress-inducing compounds (e.g. metformin, resveratrol, etc.) may facilitate beneficial TE activation and transposition and enhance fertilization and embryological development through a common mechanism of AMPK activation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30037614/

In response, we present a factorial analysis of a multi-level oddball task - the local-global task - and we explore it when participants are sedated versus recovered. We found that the local and global levels in fact interact. This is of considerable current interest, since it has recently been argued that the MEEG response evoked by the global effect corresponds to a distinct processing mode that moves beyond predictive coding. This interaction suggests that the two processing modes are not distinct. Additionally, we observed that sedation modulates this interaction, suggesting that conscious awareness may not be completely restricted to a single (global) processing level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30005277/

We analyzed a clinical dataset of 20 min of EEG recordings per patient from 44 mechanically ventilated adult patients receiving sedatives in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Several features derived from AD of the EEG signal were used to discriminate between awake and sedated states. We trained support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using AD features and compared the classification performance with SVM classifiers trained using standard spectral and entropy features using leave-one-subject-out validation. The potential of each feature to discriminate between awake and sedated states was quantified using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
The sedation level classification system using AD was able to reliably discriminate between sedated and awake states achieving an average AUC of 0.90, which was significantly better () than performance achieved using spectral (AUC = 0.86) and entropy (AUC = 0.81) domain features. A combined feature set consisting of AD, entropy, and spectral features provided better discrimination (AUC = 0.91, ) than any individual feature set.
Features derived from the atomic decomposition of EEG signals provide useful discriminative information about the depth of sedation in ICU patients.
With further refinement and external validation, the proposed system may be able to assist clinical staff with continuous surveillance of sedation levels in mechanically ventilated critically ill ICU patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29993386/

89 patients were identified from a prospective CA database. Follow-up was conducted by telephone interviews with legal guardians, evaluation of re-admission and rehabilitation reports assessing core elements of the coma recovery scale-revised (CRS-R). Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) and electroencephalography (EEG) original recordings were re-analyzed, the gray-white-matter ratio (GWR) was determined from brain computed tomography (CT) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) serum concentrations were retrieved.
Follow-up was successful for 32/50 (64%) patients admitted between 2001-2009 and 31/39 (79%) between 2009-2015. Median ICU stay was 27 days (IQR 20-36). Neurological improvement beyond UWS was found in 2 of 63 patients. Among 61 patients with successful follow-up and no improvement, NSE serum concentrations within the reference range, SSEP amplitudes above 2.5 μV or continuous reactive EEG were found in 5%, 3% and 2% of those tested.

As a consequence, obtaining the valuable medical data with minimal cost and impacts on hospital work comes as the first concern of researchers. Anesthesia plays a widely recognized role in surgeries, which attracts people to undertake relevant research. In this paper, a real-time physiological medical signal data acquisition system (PMSDA) for the multi-operating room applications is proposed with high universality of the hospital practical settings and research requirements. By utilizing a wireless communication approach, it provides an easily accessible network platform for collection of physiological medical signals such as photoplethysmogram (PPG), electrocardiograph (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) during the surgery. In addition, the raw data is stored on a server for safe backup and further analysis of depth of anesthesia (DoA). Results show that the PMSDA exhibits robust, high quality performance and efficiently reduces costs compared to previously manual methods and allows seamless integration into hospital environment, independent of its routine work. Overall, it provides a pragmatic and flexible surgery-data acquisition system model with low impact and resource cost applicable to research in critical and practical medical circumstances.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29961144/

Drug interaction modelling, using clinical endpoints and processed electroencephalography helps determine optimal drug concentrations to assure adequate anesthesia.
Sixty patients were randomized to receive a constant concentration of sufentanil (0.25 ng/mL (Group S0.25), 0.5 ng/mL (Group S0.5), 0 ng/mL (Group S0). Propofol was administered in steps of 0.5 µg/mL, up to 4 µg/mL. Processed EEG (Bispectral Index, Narcotrend Index) and auditory evoked potentials (composite A-Line autoregressive Index; cAAI), were recorded simultaneously. Sufentanil-propofol interaction was assessed by Probit - and nonlinear regression analysis.
Sufentanil had a dose-dependent synergistic effect on the effect-site concentration of propofol (µg/mL) associated with a 50% probability (EC50) of loss of responsiveness to verbal command (S0: 2.84 µg/mL, R2 0.773; S0.25: 1.95 µg/mL, R2 0.862; S0.5: 1.48 µg/mL, R2 0.887) and noxious stimulation (S0: 3.46 µg/mL, R2 0.626 µg/mL; S0.25: 2.17 µg/mL, R2 0.853; S0.5: 1.69 µg/mL, R2 0.897).

Generalized convulsive SE is the most common form and also represents the greatest threat to life, highlighting the importance of the choice of appropriate therapeutic treatment.
We present the therapeutic options separately for treatment during the early preclinical (>5-30min), established (30-60min), and refractory (>60min) SE phases. This division is based on time and response to AEDs, and indicates a practical approach based on pathophysiological data.
Benzodiazepines (BZD) are the first-line drugs. In cases of ineffective first-line treatment and persistence of the seizure, the use of second-line treatment: phenytoin, valproic acid or phenobarbital is required. SE that persists after the administration of benzodiazepines and phenytoin or another second-line AED at appropriate doses is defined as refractory and drug resistant and requires treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). EEG monitoring is essential during therapy at this stage. Anesthesia is typically continued for an initial period of 24h followed by a slow reversal and is re-established if seizures recur. Anesthesia is usually administered either to the level of the ""burst suppression pattern"" or to obtain the ""EEG suppression"" pattern.
Experts agree that close and early cooperation with a neurologist and anesthetist aiming to reduce the risk of pharmacoresistant cases is an extremely important factor in the treatment of patients with SE. This report has educational, practical and organizational aspects, outlining a standard plan for SE management in Poland that will improve therapeutic efficacy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29937151/

The goal of this study was to characterise the subjective experiences and accompanying EEG changes with subanaesthetic doses of ketamine.
High-density EEG was recorded in 15 human volunteers before, during, and after subanaesthetic ketamine infusion (0.5 mg kg
Ketamine-induced altered states were characterised predominantly by dissociative experiences such as disembodiment and ego transcendence; sensory disturbances were also common. Ketamine broadly decreased low-frequency power, with mean reductions largest at alpha (8-12 Hz) in parietal (-0.94 dB, P<0.001) and occipital (-1.8 dB, P<0.001) channel clusters. Significant decreases in alpha were identified in the precuneus and temporal-parietal junction.
Ketamine induces altered states of consciousness during periods of reduced alpha power in the precuneus and temporal-parietal junction. Modulation of these temporal-parietal loci are candidate mechanisms of the psychoactive effects of ketamine, given that this region is involved in multisensory integration, body representation, and consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29935579/
29933272,Electroencephalographic Arousal Patterns Under Dexmedetomidine Sedation.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2018,"Sleigh JW, Vacas S, Flexman AM, Talke PO","The depth of dexmedetomidine-induced sedation is difficult to assess without arousing the patient. We evaluated frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) as an objective measure of dexmedetomidine-induced sedation. Our aims were to characterize the response patterns of EEG during a wide range of dexmedetomidine-induced sedation and to determine which spectral power best correlated with assessed levels of dexmedetomidine-induced sedation.
Sedline EEG sensor was positioned on the forehead of 16 volunteers. Frontal EEG data were collected at 250 Hz using the Sedline monitor. A computer-controlled infusion pump was used to infuse dexmedetomidine to four 15-minute target plasma concentrations of 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 ng/mL. Arterial blood samples for dexmedetomidine plasma concentration and sedation (self-reported numerical rating scale) and arousal were measured at baseline and at the end of each infusion step. The EEG signal was used to estimate spectral power in sequential 4-second data segments with 75% overlap for 3 power bands: delta = 0.5-1.5 Hz, alpha = 9-14 Hz, beta = 15-24 Hz. We quantified the relationships among the plasma concentrations of dexmedetomidine, level of sedation, and various EEG parameters.
EEG data at the end of the dexmedetomidine infusion steps show progressive loss of high frequencies (beta) and increase in alpha and delta powers, with increasing dexmedetomidine concentrations. Beta prearousal spectral power was best in predicting dexmedetomidine-induced level of sedation (R = -0.60, 95% CI, -0.43 to -0.75). The respective values for delta and alpha powers were R = 0.28 (95% CI, 0.03-0.45) and R = 0.16 (95% CI, -0.09 to 0.38). When the beta power has dropped below -16 dB or the delta power is above 15 dB, the subjects show moderate to deep levels of sedation. When awakening the subject, there is a reduction in power in the delta and alpha bands at the 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 ng/mL dexmedetomidine target levels (P < .001 for all). In beta band, there is a rapid awakening-induced increase in power (P < .001) followed by a slow return toward baseline values. After arousing the subjects, the EEG powers returned toward baseline values significantly slower than our clinical observation of the subjects' wakefulness would have suggested.
Using a wide range of dexmedetomidine doses, we found that frontal EEG beta power of less than -16 dB and/or a delta power of over 15 dB was associated with a state of moderate to deep sedation and that poststimulus return of EEG powers toward baseline values took significantly longer than expected from observation of the arousal response. It is unclear whether these observations are robust enough for clinical applicability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29933272/

However, the distinct EEG dynamic characteristics at comparable sedation levels have not been well studied, resulting in potential interpretation errors in EEG monitoring during sedation. We aimed to analyze the EEG dynamics of dexmedetomidine and propofol at comparable sedation levels and to explore EEG changes with increased sedation levels for each agent. We measured the Bispectral Index (BIS) and 20-channel EEG under dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation from wakefulness, moderate sedation, and deep sedation to recovery in healthy volunteers (n = 10) in a randomized, 2-day, crossover study. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels. Despite similar changes in increased delta oscillations, multiple differences in the EEG spatiotemporal dynamics were observed between these two agents. During moderate sedation, both dexmedetomidine and propofol induced increased spindle power; however, dexmedetomidine decreased the global alpha/beta/gamma power, whereas propofol decreased the alpha power in the occipital area and increased the global spindle/beta/gamma power. During deep sedation, dexmedetomidine was associated with increased fronto-central spindle power and decreased global alpha/beta/gamma power, but propofol was associated with increased theta/alpha/spindle/beta power, which was maximized in the frontal area. The transition of topographic alpha/spindle/beta power distribution from moderate sedation to deep sedation completely differed between these two agents. Our study demonstrated that there was a distinct hierarchy of EEG changes with increased sedation depths by propofol and dexmedetomidine. Differences in EEG dynamics at the same sedation level might account for differences in the BIS value and reflect the different sedation mechanisms. EEG-based clinical sedation monitoring should consider the effect of drug types on EEG dynamics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29920532/
29920378,Suppression of underlying neuronal fluctuations mediates EEG slowing during general anaesthesia.,NeuroImage,2018,"Hutt A, Lefebvre J, Hight D, Sleigh J","The physiological mechanisms by which anaesthetic drugs modulate oscillatory brain activity remain poorly understood. Combining human data, mathematical and computational analysis of both spiking and mean-field models, we investigated the spectral dynamics of encephalographic (EEG) beta-alpha oscillations, observed in human patients undergoing general anaesthesia. The effect of anaesthetics can be modelled as a reduction of neural fluctuation intensity, and/or an increase in inhibitory synaptic gain in the thalamo-cortical circuit. Unlike previous work, which suggested the primary importance of gamma-amino-butryic-acid (GABA) augmentation in causing a shift to low EEG frequencies, our analysis demonstrates that a non-linear transition, triggered by a simple decrease in neural fluctuation intensity, is sufficient to explain the clinically-observed appearance - and subsequent slowing - of the beta-alpha narrowband EEG peak. In our model, increased synaptic inhibition alone, did not correlate with the clinically-observed encephalographic spectral changes, but did cause the anaesthetic-induced decrease in neuronal firing rate. Taken together, our results show that such a non-linear transition results in functional fragmentation of cortical and thalamic populations; highly correlated intra-population dynamics triggered by anaesthesia decouple and isolate neural populations. Our results are able to parsimoniously unify and replicate the observed anaesthetic effects on both the EEG spectra and inter-regional connectivity, and further highlight the importance of neural activity fluctuations in the genesis of altered brain states.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29920378/

Changes in neuronal oscillation amplitude across states of consciousness have been widely reported, but little is known about possible changes in the temporal dynamics of these oscillations. The temporal structure of brain oscillations may provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness. To address this question, we examined long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of EEG oscillation amplitudes recorded during both wakefulness and anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Importantly, the time-varying EEG oscillation envelopes were assessed over the course of a sevoflurane sedation protocol during which the participants alternated between states of consciousness and unconsciousness. Both spectral power and LRTC in oscillation amplitude were computed across multiple frequency bands. State-dependent differences in these features were assessed using non-parametric tests and supervised machine learning. We found that periods of unconsciousness were associated with increases in LRTC in beta (15-30Hz) amplitude over frontocentral channels and with a suppression of alpha (8-13Hz) amplitude over occipitoparietal electrodes. Moreover, classifiers trained to predict states of consciousness on single epochs demonstrated that the combination of beta LRTC with alpha amplitude provided the highest classification accuracy (above 80%). These results suggest that loss of consciousness is accompanied by an augmentation of temporal persistence in neuronal oscillation amplitude, which may reflect an increase in regularity and a decrease in network repertoire compared to the brain's activity during resting-state consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29885482/

This review discusses new advancements in ECT with regards to anesthetic variables, stimulus, and response variables along with their impact on clinical outcomes.
Anesthetic variables influence clinical efficacy and patient tolerance of ECT. Although etomidate or a ketamine-propofol combination may be the first choice for many clinicians, the search for ideal induction agent continues. Dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, or ketamine may aid in augmentation of ECT; however, they are not recommended routinely. A systematic procedure for hyperventilation of the patient has been shown to have clinical repercussions. Optimizing anesthesia-ECT time interval (ASTI) has a significant impact on the success of the procedure. BIS monitoring alone cannot be relied upon for timing stimulus. High-dose brief pulse right unilateral ECT represents an acceptable first-line form of treatment, though there is currently no 'gold standard'. Other stimulus variations such as focal electrically administered seizure therapy, individualized low-amplitude seizure therapy, magnetic seizure therapy, left unilateral and left anterior right temporal electrode placements are explored to reduce memory effects. EEG ictal indices may be relied upon for seizure adequacy, and therefore may be used to both guide treatment and predict the outcome of the procedure.
Modern ECT is streamlined by augmentation with drugs, hyperventilation, optimizing anesthesia-ECT time interval, and various stimulus parameters guided by seizure adequacy markers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29870425/

However, limitations in current analysis techniques have called into question whether these techniques improve standard of care, or instead call for improved, more ubiquitously applicable measures to assess anesthetic transitions and depth. This review highlights emerging analytical approaches and techniques from neuroscience research that have the potential to better capture anesthetic transitions to provide better measurements of anesthetic depth.
Since the introduction of electroencephalography, neuroscientists, engineers, mathematicians, and clinicians have all been developing new ways of analyzing continuous electrical signals. Collaborations between these fields have proliferated several analytical techniques that demonstrate how anesthetics affect brain dynamics and conscious transitions. Here, we review techniques in the following categories: network science, integration and information, nonlinear dynamics, and artificial intelligence.
Up-and-coming techniques have the potential to better clinically define and characterize altered consciousness time points. Such new techniques used alongside traditional measures have the potential to improve depth of anesthesia measurements and enhance an understanding of how the brain is affected by anesthetic agents.

Few studies detailing the neural-circuit activity of general anaesthesia in children have been described. The study aim was to identify age-related changes in EEG characteristics that mirror different stages of early human brain development during sevoflurane anaesthesia.
Multichannel EEG recordings were performed in 91 children aged 0-3 yr undergoing elective surgery. We mapped spatial power and coherence over the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices during maintenance anaesthesia.
During sevoflurane exposure: (i) slow-delta (0.1-4 Hz) oscillations were present in all ages, (ii) theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations emerge by ∼4 months, (iii) alpha oscillations increased in power from 4 to 10 months, (iv) frontal alpha-oscillation predominance emerged at ∼6 months, (v) frontal slow oscillations were coherent from birth until 6 months, and (vi) frontal alpha oscillations became coherent ∼10 months and persisted in older ages.
Key developmental milestones in the maturation of the thalamo-cortical circuitry likely generate changes in EEG patterns in infants undergoing sevoflurane general anaesthesia. Characterisation of anaesthesia-induced EEG oscillations in children demonstrates the importance of developing age-dependent strategies to monitor properly the brain states of children receiving general anaesthesia.

Monitoring of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) or evoked potential (EP) indices may prevent or minimize POD and POCD, probably through optimization of anaesthetic doses.
To assess whether the use of processed EEG or auditory evoked potential (AEP) indices (bispectral index (BIS), narcotrend index, cerebral state index, state entropy and response entropy, patient state index, index of consciousness, A-line autoregressive index, and auditory evoked potentials (AEP index)) as guides to anaesthetic delivery can reduce the risk of POD and POCD in non-cardiac surgical or non-neurosurgical adult patients undergoing general anaesthesia compared with standard practice where only clinical signs are used.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trial registry databases up to 28 March 2017. We updated this search in February 2018, but these results have not been incorporated in the review.
We included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing any method of processed EEG or evoked potential techniques (entropy, BIS, AEP etc.) against a control group where clinical signs were used to guide doses of anaesthetics in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing general anaesthesia for non-cardiac or non-neurosurgical elective operations.
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: occurrence of POD; and occurrence of POCD. Secondary outcomes included: all-cause mortality; any postoperative complications; and postoperative length of stay. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.
We included six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 2929 participants comparing processed EEG or EP indices-guided anaesthesia with clinical signs-guided anaesthesia. There are five ongoing studies and one study awaiting classification.Anaesthesia administration guided by the indices from a processed EEG (bispectral index) probably reduces the risk of POD within seven days after surgery with risk ratio (RR) of 0.71 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 17, 95% CI 11 to 34; 2197 participants; 3 RCTs; moderate quality of evidence). Three trials also showed the lower rate of POCD at 12 weeks after surgery (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.96; NNTB 38, 95% CI 21 to 289; 2051 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but it is uncertain whether processed EEG indices reduce POCD at one week (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02; 3 trials; 1989 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and at 52 weeks (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.80; 1 trial; 59 participants; very low quality of evidence). There may be little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.64; 1 trial; 1155 participants; low-quality evidence). One trial suggested a lower risk of any postoperative complications with processed EEG (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; 902 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no effect on reduced postoperative length of stay (mean difference -0.2 days, 95% CI -2.02 to 1.62; 1155 participants; low-quality evidence).
There is moderate-quality evidence that optimized anaesthesia guided by processed EEG indices could reduce the risk of postoperative delirium in patients aged 60 years or over undergoing non-cardiac surgical and non-neurosurgical procedures. We found moderate-quality evidence that postoperative cognitive dysfunction at three months could be reduced in these patients. The effect on POCD at one week and over one year after surgery is uncertain. There are no data available for patients under 60 years.

29746721,Melatonin for the promotion of sleep in adults in the intensive care unit.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2018,"Lewis SR, Pritchard MW, Schofield-Robinson OJ, Alderson P, Smith AF","Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) experience sleep deprivation caused by environmental disruption, such as high noise levels and 24-hour lighting, as well as increased patient care activities and invasive monitoring as part of their care. Sleep deprivation affects physical and psychological health, and patients perceive the quality of their sleep to be poor whilst in the ICU. Artificial lighting during night-time hours in the ICU may contribute to reduced production of melatonin in critically ill patients. Melatonin is known to have a direct effect on the circadian rhythm, and it appears to reset a natural rhythm, thus promoting sleep.
To assess whether the quantity and quality of sleep may be improved by administration of melatonin to adults in the intensive care unit. To assess whether melatonin given for sleep promotion improves both physical and psychological patient outcomes.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2017), Embase (1974 to September 2017), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to September 2017), and PsycINFO (1806 to September 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.
We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials with adult participants (over the age of 16) admitted to the ICU with any diagnoses given melatonin versus a comparator to promote overnight sleep. We included participants who were mechanically ventilated and those who were not mechanically ventilated. We planned to include studies that compared the use of melatonin, given at an appropriate clinical dose with the intention of promoting night-time sleep, against no agent; or against another agent administered specifically to promote sleep.
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.
We included four studies with 151 randomized participants. Two studies included participants who were mechanically ventilated, one study included a mix of ventilated and non-ventilated participants and in one study participants were being weaned from mechanical ventilation. Three studies reported admission diagnoses, which varied: these included sepsis, pneumonia and cardiac or cardiorespiratory arrest. All studies compared melatonin against no agent; three were placebo-controlled trials; and one compared melatonin with usual care. All studies administered melatonin in the evening.All studies reported adequate methods for randomization and placebo-controlled trials were blinded at the participant and personnel level. We noted high risk of attrition bias in one study and were unclear about potential bias introduced in two studies with differences between participants at baseline.It was not appropriate to combine data owing to differences in measurement tools, or methods used to report data.The effects of melatonin on subjectively rated quantity and quality of sleep are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Three studies (139 participants) reported quantity and quality of sleep as measured through reports of participants or family members or by personnel assessments. Study authors in one study reported no difference in sleep efficiency index scores between groups for participant assessment (using Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire) and nurse assessment. Two studies reported no difference in duration of sleep observed by nurses.The effects of melatonin on objectively measured quantity and quality of sleep are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (37 participants) reported quantity and quality of sleep as measured by polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, bispectral index (BIS) or electroencephalogram (EEG). Study authors in one study reported no difference in sleep efficiency index scores between groups using BIS and actigraphy. These authors also reported longer sleep in participants given melatonin which was not statistically significant, and improved sleep (described as ""better sleep"") in participants given melatonin from analysis of area under the curve (AUC) of BIS data. One study used PSG but authors were unable to report data because of a large loss of participant data.One study (82 participants) reported no evidence of a difference in anxiety scores (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (94 participants) reported data for mortality: one study reported that overall one-third of participants died; and one study reported no evidence of difference between groups in hospital mortality (very low certainty). One study (82 participants) reported no evidence of a difference in length of ICU stay (very low certainty evidence). Effects of melatonin on adverse events were reported in two studies (107 participants), and are uncertain (very low certainty evidence): one study reported headache in one participant given melatonin, and one study reported excessive sleepiness in one participant given melatonin and two events in the control group (skin reaction in one participant, and excessive sleepiness in another participant).The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was limited by sparse data with few participants. We noted study limitations in some studies due to high attrition and differences between groups in baseline data; and doses of melatonin varied between studies. Methods used to measure data were not consistent for outcomes, and use of some measurement tools may not be effective for use on the ICU patient. All studies included participants in the ICU but we noted differences in ICU protocols, and one included study used a non-standard sedation protocol with participants which introduced indirectness to the evidence.
We found insufficient evidence to determine whether administration of melatonin would improve the quality and quantity of sleep in ICU patients. We identified sparse data, and noted differences in study methodology, in ICU sedation protocols, and in methods used to measure and report sleep. We identified five ongoing studies from database and clinical trial register searches. Inclusion of data from these studies in future review updates would provide more certainty for the review outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29746721/
29673530,Brief Introduction to Electroencephalography.,Methods in enzymology,2018,Proekt A,"Electroencephalography (EEG) has a long history in neuroscience starting with its original description in humans by Hans Berger in 1929 (Berger, 1932). Investigations of EEG under anesthesia started soon after in the mid-1930s (Gibbs, 1937). No single methodology paper can credibly cover all of the issues relating to this rich field. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce some caveats that complicate and inform analysis of the EEG. Special emphasis will be given to common issues such as choice of reference electrode, filtering, artifact rejection, and spectral analysis. We will specifically emphasize high-density EEG recordings that have become the norm due to technological improvement in electrode and data acquisition design methods. In the last section we will discuss some applications of EEG analysis techniques to the study of the effects of anesthetics on the nervous system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29673530/
29669562,Comfort in palliative sedation (Compas): a transdisciplinary mixed method study protocol for linking objective assessments to subjective experiences.,BMC palliative care,2018,"Six S, Laureys S, Poelaert J, Bilsen J, Theuns P, Deschepper R","In case of untreatable suffering at the end of life, palliative sedation may be chosen to assure comfort by reducing the patient's level of consciousness. An important question here is whether such sedated patients are completely free of pain. Because these patients cannot communicate anymore, caregivers have to rely on observation to assess the patient's comfort. Recently however, more sophisticated techniques from the neurosciences have shown that sometimes consciousness and pain are undetectable with these traditional behavioral methods. The aim of this study is to better understand how unconscious palliative sedated patients experience the last days of their life and to find out if they are really free of pain.
In this study we will observe 40 patients starting with initiation of palliative sedation until death. Assessment of comfort based on behavioral observations will be related with the results from a NeuroSense monitor, an EEG-based monitor used for evaluation of the adequacy of anesthesia and sedation in the operating room and an ECG-based Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) monitor, which informs about comfort or discomfort condition, based on the parasympathetic tone. An innovative and challenging aspect of this study is its qualitative approach; ""objective"" and ""subjective"" data will be linked to achieve a holistic understanding of the study topic. The following data will be collected: assessment of pain/comfort by the patients themselves (if possible) by scoring a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); brain function monitoring; monitoring of parasympathetic tone; caregivers' assessment (pain, awareness, communication); relatives' perception of the quality of the dying process; assessment by 2 trained investigators using observational scales; video and audio registration.
Measuring pain and awareness in non-communicative dying patients is both technically and ethically challenging. ANI and EEG have shown to be promising technologies to detect pain that otherwise cannot be detected with the ""traditional"" methods. Although these technologies have the potential to provide objective quantifiable indicators for distress and awareness in non-communicative patients, strikingly they have not yet been used to check whether the current assessments for non-communicative patients are reliable.

29663283,EEG Artifact Versus Subclinical Status Epilepticus in a Patient Following Cardiac Arrest.,Neurocritical care,2018,"Cibula JE, Demos DS, Fahy BG","A challenge in ICU EEG interpretation is identifying subclinical status epilepticus versus patterns on the ictal-interictal continuum versus other repetitive patterns. In the electrically noisy intensive care unit, identifying and eliminating interference and artifact allow accurate diagnoses from the EEG, avoiding unnecessary treatment or sedation.
We present a case during Impella (Abiomed Inc, Danvers, MA) continuous flow left ventricular assist device use where the EEG artifact was initially misinterpreted as seizure by the resident and treated as status epilepticus because of the ""focal"" sharply contoured repetitive pattern. During percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), an 88-year-old developed ventricular tachycardia followed by ventricular fibrillation requiring chest compressions for 10 min, multiple defibrillations, and treatment with epinephrine, amiodarone, calcium, bicarbonate, and magnesium. The patient had an Impella placed during PCI with therapeutic hypothermia initiated after the cardiopulmonary arrest. His neurological exam demonstrated preserved pupillary, corneal, gag and cough reflexes and spontaneous respirations.
Long-term video EEG monitoring is included in our institution's hypothermia protocol. Initial baseline EEG performed 2 h after PCI showed a persistent rhythmic sharp discharge from the left central temporal region resembling left hemisphere status epilepticus. The sharp waves have an alternating repeating 2:1 relationship with the EKG rhythm strip. This is best seen in the left hemisphere, which we posit is related to the Impella's positioning across the aortic valve pointing toward the patient's left side. A chest x-ray confirmed the device's position immediately before EEG monitoring. Arterial pressure tracings were not available in the chart.
There is a low-amplitude spiky artifact; however, there was no pacing at that time. It is possible that synergistic flow with systole/diastole reinforced the pulsatility with movement of the Impella, resulting in the alternating pattern. The patient's hemodynamic instability precluded extensive troubleshooting with the Impella device, but after EEG repositioning, the artifact was eliminated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29663283/

We recorded electrocorticography (ECoG) signals in patients who underwent intracranial monitoring during awake surgery for the treatment of cerebral tumors in functional areas of the brain. Therefore, we recorded the transition from unconsciousness to consciousness directly on the brain surface. Using frequency resolved interferometry; we studied the intermediate ECoG frequencies (4-40 Hz). In the theoretical study, we used a computational Jansen and Rit neuron model to simulate recovery of consciousness (ROC). During ROC, we found that f increased by a factor equal to 1.62 ± 0.09, and δf varied by the same factor (1.61 ± 0.09) suggesting the existence of a scaling factor. We accelerated the time course of an unconscious EEG trace by an approximate factor 1.6 and we showed that the resulting EEG trace match the conscious state. Using the theoretical model, we successfully reproduced this behavior. We show that the recovery of consciousness corresponds to a transition in the frequency (f, δf) space, which is exactly reproduced by a simple time rescaling.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether ROPL can be used as a marker of cessation of seizure activity in the brain after ECT and also to study the effect of atropine premedication on seizure activity during ECT.
Forty-one patients underwent 82 sessions of ECT in a cross-over design study. The duration of motor seizure, EEG seizure, and time for ROPL was observed and compared.
The ROPL consistently outlasted EEG and motor seizures; the difference in their mean durations was statistically significant P < 0.05. There was good correlation among the 3 parameters. Atropine premedication did not alter the seizure activity and ROPL after ECT.
The ROPL after ECT stimulus is a good bedside monitor for termination of seizure activity and can be a valuable adjunct to surface EEG in monitoring the duration of epileptic activity after delivery of ECT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29613942/
29575232,The impact of Narcotrend™ EEG-guided propofol administration on the speed of recovery from pediatric procedural sedation-A randomized controlled trial.,Paediatric anaesthesia,2018,"Weber F, Walhout LC, Escher JC","Propofol is often used for procedural sedation in children undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy. Reliable assessment of the depth of hypnosis during the endoscopic procedure is challenging. Processed electroencephalography using the Narcotrend Index can help titrating propofol to a predefined sedation level.
The aim of this trial was to investigate the impact of Narcotrend Index-guided titration of propofol delivery on the speed of recovery.
Children, aged 12-17 years, undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy under procedural sedation, had propofol delivered via target controlled infusion either based on Narcotrend Index guidance (group NI) or standard clinical parameters (group C). Sedation was augmented with remifentanil in both study groups. The primary endpoint of this study was to compare the speed of fulfilling discharge criteria from the operating room between study groups. Major secondary endpoints were propofol consumption, discharge readiness from the recovery room, hypnotic depth as measured by the Narcotrend Index, and adverse events.
Of the 40 children included, data were obtainable from 37. The time until discharge readiness from the operating room was shorter in group NI than in group C, with a difference between medians of 4.76 minutes [95%CI 2.6 to 7.4 minutes]. The same accounts for recovery room discharge times; difference between medians 4.03 minutes [95%CI 0.81 to 7.61 minutes]. Propofol consumption and the percentage of EEG traces indicating oversedation were higher in group C than in group NI. There were no significant adverse events in either study group.
Narcotrend Index guidance of propofol delivery for deep sedation in children aged 12-17 years, underdoing gastrointestinal endoscopy results in faster recovery, less drug consumption, and fewer episodes of oversedation than dosing propofol according to clinical surrogate parameters of depth of hypnosis. The results of this study provide additional evidence in favor of the safety profile of propofol/remifentanil for procedural sedation in adequately selected pediatric patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29575232/

Preliminary research has linked POD with persistent cognitive impairment and decreased quality of life. However, these findings maybe confounded by patient comorbidities, postoperative complications and frailty. Our objective is to determine whether POD is an independent risk factor for persistent impairments in attention and executive function after elective surgery. Our central hypothesis is that patients with POD are more likely to have declines in cognition and quality of life 1 year after surgery compared with patients without POD. We aim to clarify whether these associations are independent of potentially confounding factors. We will also explore the association between POD and incident dementia.
This study will recruit 200 patients from the ongoing Electroencephalography Guidance of Anesthesia to Alleviate Geriatric Syndromes (ENGAGES) study. Patients who live ≤45 miles from the study centre or have a planned visit to the centre 10-16 months postoperatively will be eligible. Patients with POD, measured by the Confusion Assessment Method, will be compared with patients without delirium. The primary outcome of cognitive function and secondary outcomes of quality of life and incident dementia will be compared between cohorts. Cognition will be measured by Trails A and B and Stroop Color and Word Test, quality of life with Veteran's RAND 12-item Health Survey and incident dementia with the Short Blessed Test.

Using Sanger sequencing, we sequenced the exomes of six members of a large family affected with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and confirmed cosegregation in all 37 family members. We screened an additional 310 patients with this disorder for variants on DNA melting-curve analysis and targeted real-time DNA sequencing of the gene encoding intestinal-cell kinase ( ICK). We calculated Bayesian logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores for cosegregating variants, odds ratios in case-control associations, and allele frequencies in the Genome Aggregation Database. We performed functional tests of the effects of variants on mitosis, apoptosis, and radial neuroblast migration in vitro and conducted video-EEG studies in mice lacking a copy of Ick.
A variant, K305T (c.914A→C), cosegregated with epilepsy or polyspikes on EEG in 12 members of the family affected with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. We identified 21 pathogenic ICK variants in 22 of 310 additional patients (7%). Four strongly linked variants (K220E, K305T, A615T, and R632X) impaired mitosis, cell-cycle exit, and radial neuroblast migration while promoting apoptosis. Tonic-clonic convulsions and polyspikes on EEG resembling seizures in human juvenile myoclonic epilepsy occurred more often in knockout heterozygous mice than in wild-type mice (P=0.02) during light sleep with isoflurane anesthesia.
Our data provide evidence that heterozygous variants in ICK caused juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in 7% of the patients included in our analysis. Variant ICK affects cell processes that help explain microdysgenesis and polyspike networks observed on EEG in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Maintaining the bispectral index (BIS) or state entropy (SE) between 40 and 60 has been recommended to mitigate anesthesia awareness. Nonetheless, SEs > 70 were frequently observed at end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations unlikely to allow awareness. We sought to determine the prevalence of elevated discordant measurements during BIS and SE monitoring.
Electronic data collected over 11 months at two academic hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. At the hospital using SE, all cases were included with patients ≥ 18 yr and sevoflurane administered for at least 30 min during surgery. A cohort of cases propensity matched by age and American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status were selected from the hospital using BIS. Elevated discordant EEG indices were defined as values > 70 occurring during stable end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations > 1.5%. The odds ratio (OR) based on the probability of a case having at least one elevated discordant SE or BIS lasting ≥ two minutes (primary endpoint) was calculated.
At each hospital, 3,690 cases were studied. The mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) incidence of cases with at least one interval of an elevated discordant EEG index lasting at least two minutes was 3.6% (2.8% to 4.4%) for SE compared with 0.24% (0.17% to 0.27%) for BIS (pooled OR, 17.0; 95% CI, 8.3 to 34.7; P < 0.001).
The prevalence of an elevated discordant EEG index is much greater with SE than with BIS. Elevated index values occurring at anesthetic concentrations well above the awareness threshold need to be assessed to determine if they indicate an inadequate depth of anesthesia requiring treatment or if they simply reflect the underlying monitoring algorithm.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29524200/
29522398,Surrogate-Based Artifact Removal From Single-Channel EEG.,IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2018,"Chavez M, Grosselin F, Bussalb A, De Vico Fallani F, Navarro-Sune X","the recent emergence and success of electroencephalography (EEG) in low-cost portable devices, has opened the door to a new generation of applications processing a small number of EEG channels for health monitoring and brain-computer interfacing. These recordings are, however, contaminated by many sources of noise degrading the signals of interest, thus compromising the interpretation of the underlying brain state. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven algorithm to effectively remove ocular and muscular artifacts from single-channel EEG: the surrogate-based artifact removal (SuBAR).
by means of the time-frequency analysis of surrogate data, our approach is able to identify and filter automatically ocular and muscular artifacts embedded in single-channel EEG.
in a comparative study using artificially contaminated EEG signals, the efficacy of the algorithm in terms of noise removal and signal distortion was superior to other traditionally-employed single-channel EEG denoizing techniques: wavelet thresholding and the canonical correlation analysis combined with an advanced version of the empirical mode decomposition. Even in the presence of mild and severe artifacts, our artifact removal method provides a relative error 4 to 5 times lower than traditional techniques.
in view of these results, the SuBAR method is a promising solution for mobile environments, such as ambulatory healthcare systems, sleep stage scoring, or anesthesia monitoring, where very few EEG channels or even a single channel is available.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29522398/
29516302,Optimal Model Parameter Estimation from EEG Power Spectrum Features Observed during General Anesthesia.,Neuroinformatics,2018,"Hashemi M, Hutt A, Buhry L, Sleigh J","Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool that enables researchers to describe the experimentally observed dynamics of complex systems. Starting with a robust model including model parameters, it is necessary to choose an appropriate set of model parameters to reproduce experimental data. However, estimating an optimal solution of the inverse problem, i.e., finding a set of model parameters that yields the best possible fit to the experimental data, is a very challenging problem. In the present work, we use different optimization algorithms based on a frequentist approach, as well as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods based on Bayesian inference techniques to solve the considered inverse problems. We first probe two case studies with synthetic data and study models described by a stochastic non-delayed linear second-order differential equation and a stochastic linear delay differential equation. In a third case study, a thalamo-cortical neural mass model is fitted to the EEG spectral power measured during general anesthesia induced by anesthetics propofol and desflurane. We show that the proposed neural mass model fits very well to the observed EEG power spectra, particularly to the power spectral peaks within δ - (0 - 4 Hz) and α - (8 - 13 Hz) frequency ranges. Furthermore, for each case study, we perform a practical identifiability analysis by estimating the confidence regions of the parameter estimates and interpret the corresponding correlation and sensitivity matrices. Our results indicate that estimating the model parameters from analytically computed spectral power, we are able to accurately estimate the unknown parameters while avoiding the computational costs due to numerical integration of the model equations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29516302/
29513276,Emergence EEG pattern classification in sevoflurane anesthesia.,Physiological measurement,2018,"Liang Z, Huang C, Li Y, Hight DF, Voss LJ, Sleigh JW, Li X, Bai Y","Significant spectral electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern characteristics exist in individual patients during the re-establishment of consciousness after general anesthesia. However, these EEG patterns cannot be quantitatively identified using commercially available depth of anesthesia (DoA) monitors. This study proposes an effective classification method and indices to classify these patterns among patients.
Four types of emergence EEG patterns were identified based on the EEG data set from 52 patients undergoing sevoflurane general anesthesia from two hospitals. Then, the relative power spectrum density (RPSD) of five frequency sub-bands of clinical interest (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) were selected for emergence state analysis. Finally, a genetic algorithm support vector machine (GA-SVM) was used to identify the emergence EEG patterns. The performance was reported in terms of sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP) and accuracy (AC).
The combination of the mean and mode of RPSD in the delta and alpha band (P (delta)/P (alpha) performed the best in the GA-SVM classification. The AC indices obtained by GA-SVM across the four patterns were 90.64  ±  7.61, 81.79  ±  5.84, 82.14  ±  7.99 and 72.86  ±  11.11 respectively. Furthermore, the emergence time of the patients with EEG emergence patterns I and III increased as the patients' age increased. However, for patients with EEG emergence pattern IV, the emergence time positively correlates with the patients' age when they are under 50, and negatively correlates with it when they are over 50.
The mean and mode of P (delta)/P (alpha) is a useful index to classify the different emergence EEG patterns. In addition, these patterns may correlate with an underlying neural substrate which is related to the patients' age. Highlights ► Four emergence EEG patterns were found in γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA)-ergic anesthetic drugs. ► A genetic algorithm combined with a support vector machine (GA-SVM) was proposed to identify the emergence EEG patterns. ► The relative power spectrum density (RPSD) was used as a feature to classify the emergence EEG patterns and good accuracy was achieved. ► The statistics shows that the emergence EEG patterns are age-related and may have value in assessing postoperative brain states.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29513276/

Previous studies indicated a possible correlation between NREM sleep and GA. The purpose of this study is to compare them by in vivo human brain function to probe the neuromechanism of consciousness, so as to find out a clue to GA mechanism.
24 healthy participants were equally assigned to sleep or propofol sedation group by sleeping ability. EEG and Ramsay Sedation Scale were applied to determine sleep stage and sedation depth respectively. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) was acquired at each status. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and seed-based whole brain functional connectivity maps (WB-FC maps) were compared.
During sleep, ReHo primarily weakened on frontal lobe (especially preoptic area), but strengthened on brainstem. While during sedation, ReHo changed in various brain areas, including cingulate, precuneus, thalamus and cerebellum. Cingulate, fusiform and insula were concomitance of sleep and sedation. Comparing to sleep, FCs between the cortex and subcortical centers (centralized in cerebellum) were significantly attenuated under sedation. As sedation deepening, cerebellum-based FC maps were diminished, while thalamus- and brainstem-based FC maps were increased.
There're huge distinctions in human brain function between sleep and GA. Sleep mainly rely on brainstem and frontal lobe function, while sedation is prone to affect widespread functional network. The most significant differences exist in the precuneus and cingulate, which may play important roles in mechanisms of inducing unconciousness by anesthetics.

Whether brain-heart communication is associated with outcome after CA is unknown. Heartbeat-evoked brain potentials (HEPs) represent neurophysiological indicators of brain-heart communication. The aim of this study was to address the association between HEPs and survival after CA.
HEPs were calculated from resting EEG/ECG in 55 CA patients 24 h after resuscitation. All patients were treated with targeted temperature management and a standardized sedation protocol during assessment. We investigated the association between HEP amplitude (180-320 ms, 455-595 ms, 860-1000 ms) and 6-month survival.
Twenty-five of 55 patients (45%) were still alive at 6-month follow-up. Survivors showed a higher HEP amplitude at frontopolar and frontal electrodes in the late HEP interval than non-survivors. This effect remained significant after controlling for between-group differences in terms of age, Fentanyl dose, and time lag between resuscitation and EEG assessment.

29444638,Unusual elevation in Entropy but not in PSI during general anesthesia: a case report.,BMC anesthesiology,2018,"Kim YS, Chung D, Oh SK, Won YJ, Lee IO","EEG monitoring is useful for determining an adequate level of anesthesia. However it is sometimes interfered by various reasons. We describe a case in which we successfully confirmed the adequate depth of anesthesia by monitoring the patient state index (PSI), which was computed from the SedLine monitor data in Root (Masimo) during general anesthesia. Our case showed unusual elevations in entropy, but not in PSI.
A 34-year-old woman was scheduled for emergency surgery for a left tibial open fracture and a right femoral closed fracture, which were sustained during a traffic accident. Forty-five minutes after intubation, the response entropy abruptly increased up to 100 and state entropy to 91. Despite the absence of other abnormal events, the entropy data led to two types of incorrect decisions. The first was owing to the effect of the EMG and the second was misleading during the surgeon's hammering. However, PSI from the SedLine monitor seemed to be less influenced by the same events.
In this report, we suggest that the PSI, derived from new-generation SedLine (Root, Masimo) may be a useful parameter for clinically determining the level of sedation. The use of two monitoring devices with different EEG algorithms might be helpful for determining the anesthetic depth and making decisions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29444638/

Treatment efficacy is dependent upon the induced seizure quality, which may be influenced by a range of treatment related factors. Recently, the time interval from anesthesia to the electrical stimulation (ASTI) has been suggested to be an important determinant of seizure quality.
We measured ASTI in 73 ECT sessions given to 22 individual patients, and analyzed its influence on five seizure quality parameters (EEG seizure time, power, coherence, postictal suppression, and peak heart rate).
Longer ASTI was significantly associated with higher peak heart rate during the seizure (p = .003). After adjustment for confounders, the association continued to be significant, even after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (p = .005). ASTI was not significantly associated with other seizure parameters.
The relatively low number of sessions may lead to false negative findings. The study did not include clinical outcomes.
Longer ASTI is associated with higher peak heart rate; a phenomenon which is thought to reflect better seizure propagation to subcortical areas of the brain. The finding indicates that delay of stimulation after anesthesia could be a simple way of improving seizure quality and thereby the clinical effect of ECT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29428352/

In this study, we investigated how the hypnotic drug propofol at doses comparable to those in clinical practice influences the processing of somatosensory stimuli in the spinal cord and in primary and higher-order cortices. Using nociceptive reflexes, somatosensory evoked potentials and functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that propofol abolishes the processing of innocuous and moderate noxious stimuli at low to medium concentration levels, but that intense noxious stimuli evoked spinal and cerebral responses even during deep propofol anesthesia that caused profound electroencephalogram (EEG) burst suppression. While nociceptive reflexes and somatosensory potentials were affected only in a minor way by further increasing doses of propofol after the loss of consciousness, fMRI showed that increasing propofol concentration abolished processing of intense noxious stimuli in the insula and secondary somatosensory cortex and vastly increased processing in the frontal cortex. As the fMRI functional connectivity showed congruent changes with increasing doses of propofol - namely the temporal brain areas decreasing their connectivity with the bilateral pre-/postcentral gyri and the supplementary motor area, while connectivity of the latter with frontal areas is increased - we conclude that the changes in processing of noxious stimuli during propofol anesthesia might be related to changes in functional connectivity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29421324/

The present overview aims to describe the current role of the 2 most frequently used monitoring methods for evaluation brain function in the perioperative period, ie, electroencephalography (EEG) and brain oxygenation monitoring. Available evidence suggests that EEG-derived parameters give additional information about depth of anesthesia for optimizing anesthetic titration. The effects on reduction of drug consumption or recovery time are heterogeneous, but most studies show a reduction of recovery times if anesthesia is titrated along processed EEG. It has been hypothesized that future EEG-derived indices will allow a better understanding of the neurophysiological principles of anesthetic-induced alteration of consciousness instead of the probabilistic approach most often used nowadays.Brain oxygenation can be either measured directly in brain parenchyma via a surgical burr hole, estimated from the venous outflow of the brain via a catheter in the jugular bulb, or assessed noninvasively by near-infrared spectroscopy. The latter method has increasingly been accepted clinically due to its ease of use and increasing evidence that near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral oxygen saturation levels are associated with neurological and/or general perioperative complications and increased mortality. Furthermore, a goal-directed strategy aiming to avoid cerebral desaturations might help to reduce these complications. Recent evidence points out that this technology may additionally be used to assess autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and thereby help to titrate arterial blood pressure to the individual needs and for bedside diagnosis of disturbed autoregulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29369096/

However to date most neuroimaging or neurophysiological investigations in humans have been confined to the study of γ-Amino-Butyric-Acid-(GABA)-receptor-agonist-based anesthetics, while the effects of dissociative N-Methyl-D-Aspartate-(NMDA)-receptor-antagonist-based anesthetics ketamine, nitrous oxide (N2O) and xenon (Xe) are largely unknown. This paper describes the methods underlying the simultaneous recording of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) from healthy males during inhalation of the gaseous anesthetic agents N2O and Xe. Combining MEG and EEG data enables the assessment of electromagnetic brain activity during anesthesia at high temporal, and moderate spatial, resolution. Here we describe a detailed protocol, refined over multiple recording sessions, that includes subject recruitment, anesthesia equipment setup in the MEG scanner room, data collection and basic data analysis. In this protocol each participant is exposed to varying levels of Xe and N2O in a repeated measures cross-over design. Following relevant baseline recordings participants are exposed to step-wise increasing inspired concentrations of Xe and N2O of 8, 16, 24 and 42%, and 16, 32 and 47% respectively, during which their level of responsiveness is tracked with an auditory continuous performance task (aCPT). Results are presented for a number of recordings to highlight the sensor-level properties of the raw data, the spectral topography, the minimization of head movements, and the unequivocal level dependent effects on the auditory evoked responses. This paradigm describes a general approach to the recording of electromagnetic signals associated with the action of different kinds of gaseous anesthetics, which can be readily adapted to be used with volatile and intravenous anesthetic agents. It is expected that the method outlined can contribute to the understanding of the macro-scale mechanisms of anesthesia by enabling methodological extensions involving source space imaging and functional network analysis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29364232/

The aim is to adjust the drug dose to the real patient needs using heuristic knowledge provided by clinicians. A two-level computer decision system is proposed. The idea is to release the clinician from routine tasks so that he can focus on other variables of the patient.
The controller uses the Bispectral Index (BIS) to assess the hypnotic state of the patient. Fuzzy controller was included in a closed-loop system to reach the BIS target and reject disturbances. BIS was measured using a BIS VISTA monitor, a device capable of calculating the hypnosis level of the patient through EEG information. An infusion pump with propofol 1% is used to supply the drug to the patient. The inputs to the fuzzy inference system are BIS error and BIS rate. The output is infusion rate increment. The mapping of the input information and the appropriate output is given by a rule-base based on knowledge of clinicians.
To evaluate the performance of the fuzzy closed-loop system proposed, an observational study was carried out. Eighty one patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery were randomly distributed in 2 groups: one group using a fuzzy logic based closed-loop system (FCL) to automate the administration of propofol (42 cases); the second group using manual delivering of the drug (39 cases).

Rapid growth in sensor and recording technologies is increasing the production of time series data and the importance of rapid, accurate analyses. Time series data are commonly analyzed using time-varying spectral methods to characterize their nonstationary and often oscillatory structure. Current methods provide local estimates of data features. However, they do not offer a statistical inference framework that applies to the entire time series. The important advances that we report are state-space multitaper (SS-MT) methods, which provide a statistical inference framework for time-varying spectral analysis of nonstationary time series. We model nonstationary time series as a sequence of second-order stationary Gaussian processes defined on nonoverlapping intervals. We use a frequency-domain random-walk model to relate the spectral representations of the Gaussian processes across intervals. The SS-MT algorithm efficiently computes spectral updates using parallel 1D complex Kalman filters. An expectation-maximization algorithm computes static and dynamic model parameter estimates. We test the framework in time-varying spectral analyses of simulated time series and EEG recordings from patients receiving general anesthesia. Relative to standard multitaper (MT), SS-MT gave enhanced spectral resolution and noise reduction ([Formula: see text]10 dB) and allowed statistical comparisons of spectral properties among arbitrary time series segments. SS-MT also extracts time-domain estimates of signal components. The SS-MT paradigm is a broadly applicable, empirical Bayes' framework for statistical inference that can help ensure accurate, reproducible findings from nonstationary time series analyses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29255032/

The National Institutes of Health introduced a phased funding mechanism as one potential solution. Study-specific milestones are established for an initial pilot phase. We assess the utility of this phased approach through the ongoing Electroencephalography (EEG) Guidance of Anesthesia to Alleviate Geriatric Syndromes (ENGAGES) pragmatic clinical trial. The hypothesis of the trial is that EEG guidance of general anesthesia, through prevention of EEG suppression, can decrease postoperative delirium and its downstream negative sequelae.
In collaboration with study stakeholders, we identified critical milestones for the ENGAGES study, with themes common to many clinical trials. These themes include: regulatory tasks; enrollment targets; feasibility and impact of study intervention; primary outcome incidence; measurement reliability of primary outcome; and follow-up. Progress in achieving the milestones was assessed at regular intervals during the pilot phase by ENGAGES investigators, a National Institute on Aging program officer, and a nonpartisan research organization (Westat).
Regulatory tasks, including institutional review board approval, infrastructure establishment, and trial registration, were completed on schedule. A total of 117 patients were randomized, exceeding the target by 51. The EEG-guided protocol was successfully implemented, and a relevant effect on anesthetic practice was demonstrated (decrease in median age-adjusted minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration from 0.93 to 0.78 [P < .001] and increase in median proportion of zero EEG suppression time from 87% to 94% [P < .01]). Nearly all patients (115 of 117, 98.3%) were assessed for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method, and the delirium incidence was similar (28.1%; 95% CI, 20%-37%) to the estimate (25%) used for the sample size calculation. Good interrater reliability of delirium assessment was demonstrated (κ = 0.94 [95% CI, 0.86-1]). Finally, 1-month follow-up vital status data were obtained for 96.9% of patients, with 85.7% of patients completing at least 1 survey.
With the ENGAGES trial, we demonstrated that key milestones can be identified and progressively assessed during a pilot phase. Success in attaining appropriate milestones hypothetically predicts meaningful completion of a study, and can provide justification for proceeding beyond a pilot phase.

Propofol is known to increase GABAA inhibition and decrease H-current strength, but how it generates these rhythms and their interactions is still unknown. To investigate both generation of the alpha rhythm and its PAC to SWO, we simulate a Hodgkin-Huxley network model of a hyperpolarized thalamus and corticothalamic inputs. We find, for the first time, that the model thalamic network is capable of independently generating the sustained alpha seen in propofol, which may then be relayed to cortex and expressed on the EEG. This dose-dependent sustained alpha critically relies on propofol GABAA potentiation to alter the intrinsic spindling mechanisms of the thalamus. Furthermore, the H-current conductance and background excitation of these thalamic cells must be within specific ranges to exhibit any intrinsic oscillations, including sustained alpha. We also find that, under corticothalamic SWO UP and DOWN states, thalamocortical output can exhibit maximum alpha power at either the peak or trough of this SWO; this implies the thalamus may be the source of propofol-induced PAC. Hyperpolarization level is the main determinant of whether the thalamus exhibits trough-max PAC, which is associated with lower propofol dose, or peak-max PAC, associated with higher dose. These findings suggest: the thalamus generates a novel rhythm under GABAA potentiation such as under propofol, its hyperpolarization may determine whether a patient experiences trough-max or peak-max PAC, and the thalamus is a critical component of propofol-induced cortical spectral phenomena. Changes to the thalamus may be a critical part of how propofol accomplishes its effects, including unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29227992/

New developments in surgical approaches to OSA and the growing global incidence of the condition have stimulated increased interest and demand for drug-induced sleep endoscopy. New techniques include transoral robotic surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulation. Recent DISE literature has sought to address numerous debates including relevance of DISE findings to those during physiologic sleep and the most appropriate depth and type of sedation for DISE. Propofol and dexmedetomidine have supplanted midazolam as the drugs of choice for DISE. Techniques based on pharmacokinetic models of propofol are superior to empiric dosing with regard to risk of respiratory compromise and the reliability of dexmedetomidine to achieve adequate conditions for a complete DISE exam is questionable.
The role of DISE in surgical evaluation and planning for treatment of OSA continues to develop. Numerous questions as to the optimal anesthetic approach remain unanswered.

Electroencephalography (EEG) as a diagnostic instrument has a key role in determining the management method of seizure in children. Because of poor cooperation of some children (especially children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorders and developmental disorders) in performing EEG, it is the best choice to sedate children before EEG. The aim of present study is to evaluate the sedation efficacy of clonidine in children before EEG. In a randomized clinical trial, 45 children age 2 to 12 with seizure, who referred to Children Hospital of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences and candidate for EEG, were studied. Sedation before EEG induced by 0.5 to 2.0 mg clonidine orally. Sedation score (0 to 5) measured by using eyes condition, response to voice, and response to touch. Successful sedation, EEG performing, and hemodynamic stability were evaluated during sedation. Of all patients, 40 patients (88.88%) were sedated successfully, and EEG was performed for all of the children. Mean onset time of clonidine effect was 35.47±13.56 minutes and mean time of that the patients' level of consciousness back to the level before administrating of clonidine was 77.55±26.87 minutes. Hemodynamic states of all patients were stable during the study, and there were no significant changes in vital sign of patients. In conclusion, clonidine can be considered as a safe alternative medication for sedation for EEG, which is fortunately associated with no significant change in vital signs, which may complicate overall status of patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29202549/

Anesthetic uptake and requirement may be influenced by the non-physiological conditions during hypothermic CPB. Narcotrend-processed EEG monitoring may, therefore, be useful to guide the administration of sevoflurane during this phase.
The objective of this prospective, clinical, observational study was to assess the correlation between body temperature, Narcotrend Index (NI) and administered sevoflurane in children during CPB.
Forty-four children aged 0 to 10 years undergoing hypothermic cardiac surgery were studied. On bypass, anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane administered via the oxygenator of the heart-lung machine. Nasopharyngeal temperature, NI and minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane were recorded in intervals of 10 minutes. Expiratory gas was sampled from the oxygenator's sole expiratory port via a separate connecting line and the MAC was measured by the agent analyzer of the anesthesia machine.
Raw (r = 0.74) and corrected (r = 0.73) r-values show that narcosis depth (as indicated by NI) can primarily be explained by the interaction of MAC and temperature. The analysis of variance (without the interaction term) confirms the significant and independent association of both factors, MAC (p<0.004, 95%CI: 0.19 to 0.46) and temperature (p<0.0001, 95%CI: 0.68 to 0.78), with the NI. During hypothermia, sevoflurane had been reduced significantly (r = 0.41, p<0.0001, 95%CI: 0.33 to 0.48).
Perfusionists and anesthetists should be aware of the results of processed electroencephalograph (EEG) monitoring during CPB. Sevoflurane requirements differ inter-individually; they may decrease during cooling and increase during rewarming. Therefore, it seems reasonable to include the results of processed EEG monitoring when administering sevoflurane during CPB in children, but further studies are necessary to confirm this thesis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29199541/

Recently, interest in quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis has grown. The qualitative effects of sedation on EEG are well known, but potentially confounding effects of sedatives on qEEG after anoxic injury are poorly characterized. We hypothesize that sedation increases suppression ratio (SR) and decreases alpha/delta ratio (ADR) and amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), and that the magnitude of sedation effects will be associated with outcome.
We routinely monitor comatose post-arrest patients with EEG for 48-72h. We included comatose EEG-monitored patients after CA who had protocolized daily sedation interruptions. We used Persyst v12 to quantify qEEG parameters and calculated medians for 10min immediately prior to sedation interruption and for the last 5min of interruption. We used paired t-tests to determine whether qEEG parameters changed with sedation cessation, and logistic regression to determine whether these changes predicted functional recovery or survival at discharge.
78 subjects were included (median age 56, 65% male). Interruptions occurred a median duration of 34h post-arrest and lasted a median duration of 60min. Prior to interruption, higher aEEG predicted survival, while lower SR predicted both survival and favorable outcome. During interruption, SR decreased (p<0.001), aEEG increased (p=0.002), and ADR did not change. Larger decreases in SR predicted decreased survival (OR=1.04 per percent change; 95% CI 1.00-1.09).
Higher aEEG and lower SR predict survival after CA. Sedation alters aEEG and SR, but importantly does not appear to affect the relationship between these parameter values and outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29197598/

Herein we examined network changes using graph theoretical analysis of high-density EEG during patient-titrated propofol-induced sedation. Responsiveness was used as a surrogate for consciousness. We divided the data into five states: baseline, transition into unresponsiveness, unresponsiveness, transition into responsiveness, and recovery. Power spectral analysis showed that delta power increased from responsiveness to unresponsiveness. In unresponsiveness, delta waves propagated from frontal to parietal regions as a traveling wave. Local increases in delta connectivity were evident in parietal but not frontal regions. Graph theory analysis showed that increased local efficiency could differentiate the levels of responsiveness. Interestingly, during transitions of responsive states, increased beta connectivity was noted relative to consciousness and unconsciousness, again with increased local efficiency. Abrupt network changes are evident in the transitions in responsiveness, with increased beta band power/connectivity marking transitions between responsive states, while the delta power/connectivity changes were consistent with the fading of consciousness using its surrogate responsiveness. These results provide novel insights into the neural correlates of these behavioural transitions and EEG signatures for monitoring the levels of consciousness under sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29196672/

However, options for assessing electrophysiological activity in these structures are limited. Electromagnetic fields generated by neuronal activity in subcortical structures can be recorded noninvasively, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). However, these subcortical signals are much weaker than those generated by cortical activity. In addition, we show here that it is difficult to resolve subcortical sources because distributed cortical activity can explain the MEG and EEG patterns generated by deep sources. We then demonstrate that if the cortical activity is spatially sparse, both cortical and subcortical sources can be resolved with M/EEG. Building on this insight, we develop a hierarchical sparse inverse solution for M/EEG. We assess the performance of this algorithm on realistic simulations and auditory evoked response data, and show that thalamic and brainstem sources can be correctly estimated in the presence of cortical activity. Our work provides alternative perspectives and tools for characterizing electrophysiological activity in subcortical structures in the human brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138310/

Doubts regarding this rare but fatal diagnosis can arise, when episodic symptoms (seizures, psychiatric features, speech disturbances) are present and the EEG shows epileptiform discharges within this periodicity. This scenario may indicate non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), which is - in contrast to sCJD - a treatable and frequent condition.
Herein we report a small retrospective study of 4 elderly patients, who suffered from sCJD, but due to episodic symptoms and benzodiazepine-responsive epileptiform discharges in combination to a subacute cognitive decline, NCSE was considered as a potential differential diagnosis and therefore treated aggressively.
Ultimately, this treatment was not successful and sCJD was diagnosed in all cases. Hence, there was no diagnostic and prognostic value of abolishing periodic discharges in EEG via benzodiazepines in differentiating sCJD from NCSE in our series.
These findings indicate that periodic discharges in sCJD can be responsive to benzodiazepines andnot necessarily help to differentiate differentiation between sCJD and NCSE of other causes. We argue that an aggressive anticonvulsive treatment in this scenario should be considered cautiously, especially for invasive options like general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29125945/
29121298,Human neural correlates of sevoflurane-induced unconsciousness.,British journal of anaesthesia,2017,"Palanca BJA, Avidan MS, Mashour GA","Sevoflurane, a volatile anaesthetic agent well-tolerated for inhalation induction, provides a useful opportunity to elucidate the processes whereby halogenated ethers disrupt consciousness and cognition. Multiple molecular targets of sevoflurane have been identified, complementing imaging and electrophysiologic markers for the mechanistically obscure progression from wakefulness to unconsciousness. Recent investigations have more precisely detailed scalp EEG activity during this transition, with practical clinical implications. The relative timing of scalp potentials in frontal and parietal EEG signals suggests that sevoflurane might perturb the propagation of neural information between underlying cortical regions. Spatially distributed brain activity during general anaesthesia has been further investigated with positron emission tomography (PET) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Combined EEG and PET investigations have identified changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolic activity in frontal, parietal, and thalamic regions during sevoflurane-induced loss of consciousness. More recent fMRI investigations have revealed that sevoflurane weakens the signal correlations among brain regions that share functionality and specialization during wakefulness. In particular, two such resting-state networks have shown progressive breakdown in intracortical and thalamocortical connectivity with increasing anaesthetic concentrations: the Default Mode Network (introspection and episodic memory) and the Ventral Attention Network (orienting of attention to salient feature of the external world). These data support the hypotheses that perturbations in temporally correlated activity across brain regions contribute to the transition between states of sevoflurane sedation and general anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29121298/
29121278,Frontal alpha-delta EEG does not preclude volitional response during anaesthesia: prospective cohort study of the isolated forearm technique.,British journal of anaesthesia,2017,"Gaskell AL, Hight DF, Winders J, Tran G, Defresne A, Bonhomme V, Raz A, Sleigh JW, Sanders RD","The isolated forearm test (IFT) is the gold standard test of connected consciousness (awareness of the environment) during anaesthesia. The frontal alpha-delta EEG pattern (seen in slow wave sleep) is widely held to indicate anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness. A priori we proposed that one responder with the frontal alpha-delta EEG pattern would falsify this concept.
Frontal EEG was recorded in a subset of patients from three centres participating in an international multicentre study of IFT responsiveness following tracheal intubation. Raw EEG waveforms were analysed for power-frequency spectra, depth-of-anaesthesia indices, permutation entropy, slow wave activity saturation and alpha-delta amplitude-phase coupling.
Volitional responses to verbal command occurred in six out of 90 patients. Three responses occurred immediately following intubation in patients (from Sites 1 and 2) exhibiting an alpha-delta dominant (delta power >20 dB, alpha power >10 dB) EEG pattern. The power-frequency spectra obtained during these responses were similar to those of non-responders (P>0.05) at those sites. A further three responses occurred in (Site 3) patients not exhibiting the classic alpha-delta EEG pattern; these responses occurred later relative to intubation, and in patients had been co-administered ketamine and less volatile anaesthetic compared with Site 1 and 2 patients. None of the derived depth-of-anaesthesia indices could robustly discrimate IFT responders and non-responders.
Connected consciousness can occur in the presence of the frontal alpha-delta EEG pattern during anaesthesia. Frontal EEG parameters do not readily discriminate volitional responsiveness (a marker of connected consciousness) and unresponsiveness during anaesthesia.

Here we used multimodal electroencephalography-functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS) measurements to observe electrical and hemodynamic responses during sedation simultaneously. Forty healthy volunteers were instructed to push the button to administer sedatives in response to auditory stimuli every 9-11 s. To generally illustrate brain activity at repetitive transition points at the loss of consciousness (LOC) and the recovery of consciousness (ROC), patient-controlled sedation was performed using two different sedatives (midazolam (MDZ) and propofol (PPF)) under two surgical conditions. Once consciousness was lost via sedatives, we observed gradually increasing EEG power at lower frequencies (<15 Hz) and decreasing power at higher frequencies (>15 Hz), as well as spatially increased EEG powers in the delta and lower alpha bands, and particularly also in the upper alpha rhythm, at the frontal and parieto-occipital areas over time. During ROC from unconsciousness, these spatio-temporal changes were reversed. Interestingly, the level of consciousness was switched on/off at significantly higher effect-site concentrations of sedatives in the brain according to the use of surgical stimuli, but the spatio-temporal EEG patterns were similar, regardless of the sedative used. We also observed sudden phase shifts in fronto-parietal connectivity at the LOC and the ROC as critical points. fNIRS measurement also revealed mild hemodynamic fluctuations. Compared with general anesthesia, our results provide insights into critical hallmarks of sedative-induced (un)consciousness, which have similar spatio-temporal EEG-fNIRS patterns regardless of the stage and the sedative used.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29121108/

To identify the relationships between end-tidal sevoflurane (ETsevoflurane) concentration, age and frontal EEG spectral properties in predicting recovery of clinical-behavioural signs during emergence from sevoflurane in children 0 to 3 years of age, with and without exposure to nitrous oxide. The hypothesis was that clinical signs occur sequentially during emergence, and that for infants aged more than 3 months, changes in alpha EEG power are correlated with clinical-behavioural signs.
An observational study.
A tertiary paediatric teaching hospital from December 2012 to August 2016.
Ninety-five children aged 0 to 3 years who required surgery below the neck.
Time-course of, and ETsevoflurane concentrations at first gross body movement, first cough, first grimace, dysconjugate eye gaze, frontal (F7/F8) alpha EEG power (8 to 12 Hz), frontal beta EEG power (13 to 30 Hz), surgery-end.
Clinical signs of emergence followed an orderly sequence of events across all ages. Clinical signs occurred over a narrow ETsevoflurane, independent of age [movement: 0.4% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3 to 0.4), cough 0.3% (95% CI, 0.3 to 0.4), grimace 0.2% (95% CI, 0 to 0.3); P > 0.5 for age vs. ETsevoflurane]. Dysconjugate eye gaze was observed between ETsevoflurane 1 to 0%. In children more than 3 months old, frontal alpha EEG oscillations were present at ETsevoflurane 2.0% and disappeared at 0.5%. Movement occurred within 5 min of alpha oscillation disappearance in 99% of patients. Nitrous oxide had no effect on the time course or ETsevoflurane at which children showed body movement, grimace or cough.
Several clinical signs occur sequentially during emergence, and are independent of exposure to nitrous oxide. Eye position is poorly correlated with other clinical signs or ETsevoflurane.

29099542,Chloral hydrate as a sedating agent for neurodiagnostic procedures in children.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2017,"Fong CY, Tay CG, Ong LC, Lai NM","Paediatric neurodiagnostic investigations, including brain neuroimaging and electroencephalography (EEG), play an important role in the assessment of neurodevelopmental disorders. The use of an appropriate sedative agent is important to ensure the successful completion of the neurodiagnostic procedures, particularly in children, who are usually unable to remain still throughout the procedure.
To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of chloral hydrate as a sedative agent for non-invasive neurodiagnostic procedures in children.
We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Epilepsy Group. We searched MEDLINE (OVID SP) (1950 to July 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, Issue 7, 2017), Embase (1980 to July 2017), and the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (via CENTRAL) using a combination of keywords and MeSH headings.
We included randomised controlled trials that assessed chloral hydrate agent against other sedative agent(s), non-drug agent(s), or placebo for children undergoing non-invasive neurodiagnostic procedures.
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for their eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Results were expressed in terms of risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data, mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
We included 13 studies with a total of 2390 children. The studies were all conducted in hospitals that provided neurodiagnostic services. Most studies assessed the proportion of sedation failure during the neurodiagnostic procedure, time for adequate sedation, and potential adverse effects associated with the sedative agent.The methodological quality of the included studies was mixed, as reflected by a wide variation in their 'Risk of bias' profiles. Blinding of the participants and personnel was not achieved in most of the included studies, and three of the 13 studies had high risk of bias for selective reporting. Evaluation of the efficacy of the sedative agents was also underpowered, with all the comparisons performed in single small studies.Children who received oral chloral hydrate had lower sedation failure when compared with oral promethazine (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.82; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). Children who received oral chloral hydrate had a higher risk of sedation failure after one dose compared to those who received intravenous pentobarbital (RR 4.33, 95% CI 1.35 to 13.89; 1 study, low-quality evidence), but after two doses there was no evidence of a significant difference between the two groups (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.46; 1 study, very low-quality evidence). Children who received oral chloral hydrate appeared to have more sedation failure when compared with music therapy, but the quality of evidence was very low for this outcome (RR 17.00, 95% CI 2.37 to 122.14; 1 study). Sedation failure rates were similar between oral chloral hydrate, oral dexmedetomidine, oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride, and oral midazolam.Children who received oral chloral hydrate had a shorter time to achieve adequate sedation when compared with those who received oral dexmedetomidine (MD -3.86, 95% CI -5.12 to -2.6; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence), oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride (MD -7.5, 95% CI -7.85 to -7.15; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence), oral promethazine (MD -12.11, 95% CI -18.48 to -5.74; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence), and rectal midazolam (MD -95.70, 95% CI -114.51 to -76.89; 1 study). However, children with oral chloral hydrate took longer to achieve adequate sedation when compared with intravenous pentobarbital (MD 19, 95% CI 16.61 to 21.39; 1 study, low-quality evidence) and intranasal midazolam (MD 12.83, 95% CI 7.22 to 18.44; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence).No data were available to assess the proportion of children with successful completion of neurodiagnostic procedure without interruption by the child awakening. Most trials did not assess adequate sedation as measured by specific validated scales, except in the comparison of chloral hydrate versus intranasal midazolam and oral promethazine.Compared to dexmedetomidine, chloral hydrate was associated with a higher risk of nausea and vomiting (RR 12.04 95% CI 1.58 to 91.96). No other adverse events were significantly associated with chloral hydrate (including behavioural change, oxygen desaturation) although there was an increased risk of adverse events overall (RR 7.66, 95% CI 1.78 to 32.91; 1 study, low-quality evidence).
The quality of evidence for the comparisons of oral chloral hydrate against several other methods of sedation was very variable. Oral chloral hydrate appears to have a lower sedation failure rate when compared with oral promethazine for children undergoing paediatric neurodiagnostic procedures. The sedation failure was similar for other comparisons such as oral dexmedetomidine, oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride, and oral midazolam. When compared with intravenous pentobarbital and music therapy, oral chloral hydrate had a higher sedation failure rate. However, it must be noted that the evidence for the outcomes for the comparisons of oral chloral hydrate against intravenous pentobarbital and music therapy was of very low to low quality, therefore the corresponding findings should be interpreted with caution.Further research should determine the effects of oral chloral hydrate on major clinical outcomes such as successful completion of procedures, requirements for additional sedative agent, and degree of sedation measured using validated scales, which were rarely assessed in the studies included in this review. The safety profile of chloral hydrate should be studied further, especially the risk of major adverse effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, and oxygen desaturation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29099542/

This device works by automatically adjusting the infusion rate of propofol - a general anesthetic - in response to an electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern called burst suppression. We also designed and implemented a computational patient model which interfaces with hardware and produces realistic EEG signals in response to propofol infusion. The computational patient model is used in hardware-in-the-loop studies to evaluate the behavior of our PCLC device under realistic perturbations. Finally, we have tested the performance of our PCLC device in rodents. Results from these studies suggest that closed-loop control of medically-induced coma in humans is feasible and robust.

On neurologic examination, the pupils were reactive, brainstem reflexes were present and plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a mixed acidosis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain and angio-CT were normal. The family confirmed that the patient had had suicidal ideation, and they had discovered a bag of slug killer (metaldehyde 5%) in her room. Two hours after the admission at the ICU, her neurological state remained unchanged. Sedation with intravenous propofol and antiepileptic therapy with levetiracetam (1000 mg/24 h) were started. The next day, propofol infusion was stopped but the level of consciousness of the patient did not improve. A video-electroencephalograhy (v-EEG) showed continuous generalized paroxysms of spike-wave and sharp-slow wave complexes compatible with the diagnosis of generalized NCSE. On day 3, the episode of NCSE was controlled. Finally, 15 days after ICU admission she was discharged with a normal neurological examination.

28890688,Metastability of Neuronal Dynamics during General Anesthesia: Time for a Change in Our Assumptions?,Frontiers in neural circuits,2017,Hudson AE,"There is strong evidence that anesthetics have stereotypical effects on brain state, so that a given anesthetic appears to have a signature in the electroencephalogram (EEG), which may vary with dose. This can be usefully interpreted as the anesthetic determining an attractor in the phase space of the brain. How brain activity shifts between these attractors in time remains understudied, as most studies implicitly assume a one-to-one relationship between drug dose and attractor features by assuming stationarity over the analysis interval and analyzing data segments of several minutes in length. Yet data in rats anesthetized with isoflurane suggests that, at anesthetic levels consistent with surgical anesthesia, brain activity alternates between multiple attractors, often spending on the order of 10 min in one activity pattern before shifting to another. Moreover, the probability of these jumps between attractors changes with anesthetic concentration. This suggests the hypothesis that brain state is metastable during anesthesia: though it appears at equilibrium on short timescales (on the order of seconds to a few minutes), longer intervals show shifting behavior. Compelling evidence for metastability in rats anesthetized with isoflurane is reviewed, but so far only suggestive hints of metastability in brain states exist with other anesthetics or in other species. Explicit testing of metastability during anesthesia will require experiments with longer acquisition intervals and carefully designed analytic approaches; some of the implications of these constraints are reviewed for typical spectral analysis approaches. If metastability exists during anesthesia, it implies degeneracy in the relationship between brain state and effect site concentration, as there is not a one-to-one mapping between the two. This degeneracy could explain some of the reported difficulty in using brain activity monitors to titrate drug dose to prevent awareness during anesthesia and should force a rethinking of the notion of depth of anesthesia as a single dimension. Finally, explicit incorporation of knowledge of the dynamics of the brain during anesthesia could offer better depth of anesthesia monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28890688/

We tested the hypothesis that its function will be altered during unconsciousness.
Changes in the mean squared coherences in five conventional frequency bands (delta to gamma) in DMRSN during general anaesthesia (GA) were investigated in 39 patients. They were compared with the normal EEG of 86 alert subjects, severely abnormal EEG of 112 patients with dementia and/or encephalopathy, and the mathematical model of brain death.
Anaesthetised patients showed significant decrease in the gamma coherence in the posterior area of the DMRSN compared to both the control group and the patients with dementia and/or encephalopathy. Among the anaesthetized patients 21 had a clear burst suppression pattern with prolonged epochs of suppression in EEG. In suppressed EEG segment the differences between the connections of the anterior to posterior parts and connections between the posterior parts of the DMRSN were almost lost. However, they still showed highly significant differences in most items when compared with coherences in the mathematical model of brain death.
The functional connectivity in the DMRSN could be a reliable and robust method for assessing the depth of anaesthesia and maybe also disorders of consciousness in general.

Anesthesia was administered at the discretion of the anesthetist. aEEG monitoring was started six hours preoperatively until 24 hours after surgery. Analysis of classes of aEEG background patterns, ranging from continuous normal voltage to flat trace in six classes, and quantitative EEG-measures, using spontaneous activity transients (SATs) and interSATintervals (ISI), was performed.
In total, 111 neonates were included (36 preterm/75 full-term), age at time of surgery was (median (range) 2 (0-32) days. During anesthesia depression of brain activity was seen, with background patterns ranging from flat trace to discontinuous normal voltage. In most patients brain activity was two background pattern classes lower during anesthesia. After cessation of anesthesia, recovery to preoperative brain activity occurred within 24 hours in 86% of the preterm and 96% of the term infants.

Background pattern and quantitative EEG-values were not associated with brain lesions (χ2(4) = 2.086, ns).
aEEG shows a variable reduction of brain activity in response to anesthesia in neonates with noncardiac congenital anomalies, with fast recovery after cessation of anesthesia.

Influence of arousal on bispectral index and sedation.,British journal of anaesthesia,2017,"Colin PJ, Hannivoort LN, Eleveld DJ, Reyntjens KMEM, Absalom AR, Vereecke HEM, Struys MMRF","Dexmedetomidine, a selective α 2 -adrenoreceptor agonist, has unique characteristics, such as maintained respiratory drive and production of arousable sedation. We describe development of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine, taking into account the effect of stimulation on its sedative properties.
In a two-period, randomized study in 18 healthy volunteers, dexmedetomidine was delivered in a step-up fashion by means of target-controlled infusion using the Dyck model. Volunteers were randomized to a session without background noise and a session with pre-recorded looped operating room background noise. Exploratory pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling and covariate analysis were conducted in NONMEM using bispectral index (BIS) monitoring of processed EEG.
We found that both stimulation at the time of Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale scoring and the presence or absence of ambient noise had an effect on the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine. The stimuli associated with MOAA/S scoring increased the BIS of sedated volunteers because of a transient 170% increase in the effect-site concentration necessary to reach half of the maximal effect. In contrast, volunteers deprived of ambient noise were more resistant to dexmedetomidine and required, on average, 32% higher effect-site concentrations for the same effect as subjects who were exposed to background operating room noise.
The new pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models might be used for effect-site rather than plasma concentration target-controlled infusion for dexmedetomidine in clinical practice, thereby allowing tighter control over the desired level of sedation.

In 9 patients undergoing tumor surgery in the central region, subdural strip electrodes were placed for intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. We recorded the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) simultaneously by custom-made LNA and by a commercial device (CD). We varied the stimulation rate between 1.3 and 12.7Hz to tune the SNR of the N20 component and the evoked HFO and quantified HFO detectability at the single trial level. In three patients we compared Propofol® and Sevoflurane® anesthesia.
In the average, amplitude decreased in both in N20 and evoked HFO amplitude with increasing stimulation rate (p<0.05). We detected a higher percentage of single trial evoked HFO with the LNA (p<0.001) for recordings with low impedance (<5kΩ). Average amplitudes were indistinguishable between anesthesia compounds.

There were 1,521 respondents from 47 countries, 57% had implemented the ABCDEF bundle, with varying degrees of compliance across continents. Most of the respondents (83%) used a scale to evaluate pain. Spontaneous awakening trials and spontaneous breathing trials are performed in 66% and 67% of the responder ICUs, respectively. Sedation scale was used in 89% of ICUs. Delirium monitoring was implemented in 70% of ICUs, but only 42% used a validated delirium tool. Likewise, early mobilization was ""prescribed"" by most, but 69% had no mobility team and 79% used no formal mobility scale. Only 36% of the respondents assessed ICU-acquired weakness. Family members were actively involved in 67% of ICUs; however, only 33% used dedicated staff to support families and only 35% reported that their unit was open 24 hr/d for family visits.

Commonly, increases in BOLD signal are ascribed to cellular excitation.
The relationship between electrical activity and BOLD signal in the human brain was probed on the basis of burst suppression EEG. This condition includes two distinct states of high and low electrical activity.
Resting-state simultaneous EEG and BOLD measurements were acquired during deep sevoflurane anesthesia with burst suppression EEG in nineteen healthy volunteers. Afterwards, fMRI volumes were assigned to one of the two states (burst or suppression) as defined by the EEG.
In the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes as well as in the basal ganglia, BOLD signal increased after burst onset in the EEG and decreased after onset of EEG suppression. In contrast, BOLD signal in the occipital lobe was anticorrelated to electrical activity. This finding was obtained consistently in a general linear model and in raw data.
In human brains exhibiting burst suppression EEG induced by sevoflurane, the positive correlation between BOLD signal and electrical brain activity could be confirmed in most gray matter. The exceptional behavior of the occipital lobe with an anticorrelation of BOLD signal and electrical activity might be due to specific neurovascular coupling mechanisms that are pronounced in the deeply anesthetized brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28729926/

However, classical time-averaged methods of connectivity dismiss dynamic and temporal characteristics of functional configurations. Here we demonstrate a new approach which characterizes time-varying patterns of functional connectivity at the subsecond time scale.
We introduce phase-lag entropy (PLE), a measure of the diversity of temporal patterns in the phase relationships between two signals. The proposed measure was applied to multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG), which were recorded from two distinct experimental settings: (1) propofol was administrated at a constant infusion rate for 60 min (n = 96); (2) administration of propofol by a target effect-site concentration-controlled infusion with simultaneous assessment of the level of consciousness (n = 10).
From the first dataset, two substantial changes of the phase relationship during anesthesia was found: (1) the dynamics of the phase relationship between frontal channels became progressively less diverse and more stereotyped during unconsciousness, quantified as a reduction in PLE; and (2) the reduction in PLE was consistent across subjects. Furthermore, PLE provided better performance in the classification of states of consciousness than did phase-lag index, a classical time-averaged connectivity method. From the second dataset, PLE showed the highest agreement with the level of consciousness, compared to existing anesthetic depth indicators.
This study suggests that a scarcity of functional configurations is closely associated with anesthetically induced unconsciousness, and shows promise as a basis for a new consciousness monitoring system during general anesthesia.

Here we characterize spindles in 11,630 individuals aged 4 to 97 years, as a prelude to future genetic studies. Spindle properties are highly reliable but exhibit distinct developmental trajectories. Across the night, we observe complex patterns of age- and frequency-dependent dynamics, including signatures of circadian modulation. We identify previously unappreciated correlates of spindle activity, including confounding by body mass index mediated by cardiac interference in the EEG. After taking account of these confounds, genetic factors significantly contribute to spindle and spectral sleep traits. Finally, we consider topographical differences and critical measurement issues.

28622355,Anesthetic action on the transmission delay between cortex and thalamus explains the beta-buzz observed under propofol anesthesia.,PloS one,2017,"Hashemi M, Hutt A, Hight D, Sleigh J","In recent years, more and more surgeries under general anesthesia have been performed with the assistance of electroencephalogram (EEG) monitors. An increase in anesthetic concentration leads to characteristic changes in the power spectra of the EEG. Although tracking the anesthetic-induced changes in EEG rhythms can be employed to estimate the depth of anesthesia, their precise underlying mechanisms are still unknown. A prominent feature in the EEG of some patients is the emergence of a strong power peak in the β-frequency band, which moves to the α-frequency band while increasing the anesthetic concentration. This feature is called the beta-buzz. In the present study, we use a thalamo-cortical neural population feedback model to reproduce observed characteristic features in frontal EEG power obtained experimentally during propofol general anesthesia, such as this beta-buzz. First, we find that the spectral power peak in the α- and δ-frequency ranges depend on the decay rate constant of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, but the anesthetic action on synapses does not explain the beta-buzz. Moreover, considering the action of propofol on the transmission delay between cortex and thalamus, the model reveals that the beta-buzz may result from a prolongation of the transmission delay by increasing propofol concentration. A corresponding relationship between transmission delay and anesthetic blood concentration is derived. Finally, an analytical stability study demonstrates that increasing propofol concentration moves the systems resting state towards its stability threshold.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28622355/

Since the anesthetic drugs act mainly on the central nervous system, the analysis of brain activity using electroencephalogram (EEG) is very useful. This paper proposes a novel automated method for assessing the DoA using EEG. First, 11 features including spectral, fractal, and entropy are extracted from EEG signal and then, by applying an algorithm according to exhaustive search of all subsets of features, a combination of the best features (Beta-index, sample entropy, shannon permutation entropy, and detrended fluctuation analysis) is selected. Accordingly, we feed these extracted features to a new neurofuzzy classification algorithm, adaptive neurofuzzy inference system with linguistic hedges (ANFIS-LH). This structure can successfully model systems with nonlinear relationships between input and output, and also classify overlapped classes accurately. ANFIS-LH, which is based on modified classical fuzzy rules, reduces the effects of the insignificant features in input space, which causes overlapping and modifies the output layer structure. The presented method classifies EEG data into awake, light, general, and deep states during anesthesia with sevoflurane in 17 patients. Its accuracy is 92% compared to a commercial monitoring system (response entropy index) successfully. Moreover, this method reaches the classification accuracy of 93% to categorize EEG signal to awake and general anesthesia states by another database of propofol and volatile anesthesia in 50 patients. To sum up, this method is potentially applicable to a new real-time monitoring system to help the anesthesiologist with continuous assessment of DoA quickly and accurately.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28574372/

Therefore, identifying a common feature of ketamine- and propofol-induced unconsciousness would provide insight into the underlying mechanism of losing consciousness. In this study we search for a common feature by applying the concept of type-II complexity, and argue that neural complexity is essential for a brain to maintain consciousness. To test this hypothesis, we show that complexity is suppressed during loss of consciousness induced by ketamine or propofol. We analyzed the randomness (type-I complexity) and complexity (type-II complexity) of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals before and after bolus injection of ketamine or propofol. For the analysis, we use Mean Information Gain (MIG) and Fluctuation Complexity (FC), which are information-theory-based measures that quantify disorder and complexity of dynamics respectively. Both ketamine and propofol reduced the complexity of the EEG signal, but ketamine increased the randomness of the signal and propofol decreased it. The finding supports our claim and suggests EEG complexity as a candidate for a consciousness indicator.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28572032/

Individuals older than 18 years with post-anoxic coma hospitalized in intensive care units after cardiac arrest (CA) regardless of cause (cardiac or non-cardiac) and location of event (in or out-of-hospital).
Clinical, biological and neurophysiological data were collected within 48 hours from CA. Clinical data included time of no and low flow, CA rhythm, pupillary reflex, Glasgow motor score at admission and hyperthermia. Biological marker was the highest creatinine level. Neurophysiological parameters included EEG pattern and reactivity, Somatosensory Evoked Potential (SSEP), and Middle-Latency (ML) SSEP evoked at low (10 mA) and high (50 mA) intensity stimulation. Level of Cognitive Functioning Scale (LCFS), Disability Rating Scale and recovery from coma (Revised coma Recovery Scale [CRS-R]) were collected at 12 months. A LASSO multiple regression analysis was fitted to data to investigate the best predictors of LCF, DRS and CRS-R. In-sample prediction was obtained to verify the quality of fitting, and accuracy indices (i.e., total error rate) produced.
Presence of short and medium latency SSEPs with low and high stimulation intensity were identified as prognostic predictors of outcome for all the scales. Error rate was 4.5% for CRS and LCF, and 9.1% for DRS.
Middle latency somatosensory evoked potentials associated with short latency somatosensory evoked potentials during the first 48 hours after a cardiac arrest are strong predictors of functional outcome at 12 months from the event.

Results The results revealed increased activity in the cuneus at delta-band frequencies, and in the posterior cingulate cortex at theta frequencies, during awake and sedated states induced by DEX at specific frequency bands. Differences in standardized low resolution cingulate gyrus were found in beta1 frequencies (13-18 Hz), and in the cuneus at gamma frequencies. Conclusion Cerebral cortical activity was significantly altered in various brain areas during DEX sedation, including parts of the default mode network and common midline core in different frequency ranges.

The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in functional connectivity of the parietal-frontal network resulting from nitrous oxide-induced sedation, and to determine the neural correlates of cognitive impairment during consciousness transition states. Electroencephalography was acquired from healthy adult patients who underwent nitrous oxide inhalation to induce cognitive impairment, and was analyzed using Granger causality (GC). Periods of awake, sedation and recovery for GC between frontal and parietal areas in the delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma and total frequency bands were obtained. The Friedman test with post-hoc analysis was conducted for GC values of each period for comparison. As a sedated state was induced by nitrous oxide inhalation, power in the low frequency band showed increased activity in frontal regions that was reversed with discontinuation of nitrous oxide. Feedback and feedforward connections analyzed in spectral GC were changed differently in accordance with EEG frequency bands in the sedated state by nitrous oxide administration. Calculated spectral GC of the theta, alpha, and beta frequency regions in the parietal-to-frontal direction was significantly decreased in the sedated state while spectral GC in the reverse direction did not show significant change. Frontal-parietal functional connectivity is significantly affected by nitrous oxide inhalation.

In previous electroencephalography (EEG) studies, GHB was shown to induce an electrophysiological pattern of ""paradoxical EEG-behavioral dissociation"" characterized by increased delta and theta oscillations usually associated with sleep during awake states. However, no detailed source localization of these alterations and no connectivity analyses have been performed yet.
We tested the effects of GHB (20 and 35 mg/kg, p.o.) on current source density (CSD), lagged phase synchronization (LPS), and global omega complexity (GOC) of neuronal oscillations in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced cross-over study in 19 healthy, male participants using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) of resting-state high-density EEG recordings.
Compared to placebo, GHB increased CSD of theta oscillations (5-7 Hz) in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and alpha1 (8-10 Hz) oscillations in the anterior cingulate cortex. Higher blood plasma values were associated with higher LPS values of delta (2-4 Hz) oscillations between the PCC and the right inferior parietal lobulus. Additionally, GHB decreased GOC of alpha1 oscillations.
These findings indicate that alterations in neuronal oscillations in the PCC mediate the psychotropic effects of GHB. Theta oscillations emerging from the PCC in combination with stability of functional connectivity within the default mode network might explain the GHB-related ""paradoxical EEG-behavioral dissociation.""

Treatment data of 60 patients who underwent a total number of 13 ECTs (median) because of the severe or treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (DSM-IV) were analyzed. Etomidate, mean dosage (SD) = 0.25 (0.04) mg/kg, was used for anesthesia in 29 participants; 31 patients received S-ketamine, mean dosage (SD) = 0.96 (0.26) mg/kg. Right unilateral brief pulse ECTs were performed. The number of ECTs was individually adjusted to clinical needs, mean (SD) = 13.0 (4.3). Seizure characteristics, adverse events, and the clinical global impression (CGI) scores were compared between the both groups during ECT series. In the S-ketamine group, a lower initial seizure threshold (p = 0.014), stimulation charge (p < 0.001), higher postictal suppression (p < 0.001), EEG ictal amplitude (p = 0.04), EEG coherence (p < 0.001) and maximum heart rate (p = 0.015) were measured. Etomidate was associated with more frequent abortive seizures (p = 0.02) and restimulations (p = 0.01). The CGI scores, the number of sessions within an ECT series, and the incidence of adverse events did not differ between groups. Due to its lower initial seizure threshold, S-ketamine might hold a potential to become a clinically favorable anesthetic agent during ECT.

Induced intracranial spike activity in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.,Epilepsy research,2017,"Kjaer TW, Hogenhaven H, Lee AP, Madsen FF, Jespersen B, Brennum J, Derm L, Moltke FB","Patients with medically refractory epilepsy may benefit from resective epilepsy surgery. However even the best centers experience surgical failures. It is therefore important to find techniques that may aid in neurosurgical planning of epileptic focus resection. Recordings of electrical brain activity with EEG during seizures reveal abnormal cortical hypersynchronization. Between seizures the EEG often shows interictal depolarizing phenomena such as spikes reflecting an irritable focus of the brain. In the present study we investigated the effect of intravenous remifentanil on the spike activity in the temporal neocortex and hippocampus. We examined 65 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy during surgery, prior to resection. We used a 20-lead grid on the cortex and a 4-lead strip in the lateral ventricle on the hippocampus. At least two 3-min periods of ECoG were recorded - before and after remifentanil injection. In a number of patients we examined the effect of repeated injections in order to estimate the dose-response curve. We describe a significant effect of remifentanil on the average spike activity with an increment from 16 spikes per minute at baseline to 36 spikes per minute after remifentanil injection (p<0.0001). The increase in spike activity was typically seen after 40-50s. When mu-receptors were antagonized with a preceding injection of naloxone, spike activity increased 25% in response to remifentanil as opposed to 80% when remifentanil was preceded by placebo. In only seven out of 59 patients did the injection of remifentanil change the topographic location of the spike focus. Typically administration of remifentanil led to a focus of increased spike count. Activity in other areas was suppressed making the focus stand out from the background. Our observation that remifentanil potentiates spike activity is in agreement with previous findings from smaller studies. Furthermore, we were able to describe the pharmacodynamics of the remifentanil effect on spike activity. Peri-operative provocation with remifentanil may play a future role in guiding neurosurgical intervention during epilepsy resection surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28414967/
28408923,Novel Methods for Measuring Depth of Anesthesia by Quantifying Dominant Information Flow in Multichannel EEGs.,Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2017,"Cha KM, Choi BM, Noh GJ, Shin HC","In this paper, we propose novel methods for measuring depth of anesthesia (DOA) by quantifying dominant information flow in multichannel EEGs. Conventional methods mainly use few EEG channels independently and most of multichannel EEG based studies are limited to specific regions of the brain. Therefore the function of the cerebral cortex over wide brain regions is hardly reflected in DOA measurement. Here, DOA is measured by the quantification of dominant information flow obtained from principle bipartition. Three bipartitioning methods are used to detect the dominant information flow in entire EEG channels and the dominant information flow is quantified by calculating information entropy. High correlation between the proposed measures and the plasma concentration of propofol is confirmed from the experimental results of clinical data in 39 subjects. To illustrate the performance of the proposed methods more easily we present the results for multichannel EEG on a two-dimensional (2D) brain map.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28408923/

Functional and directed connectivity were studied with phase lag index and directed phase transfer entropy. Network topology was characterized using the minimum spanning tree (MST). A random forest classifier was calculated based on all measures to obtain discriminative ability between the three groups.
Non-delirious control subjects showed a back-to-front information flow, which was lost during hypoactive delirium (p=0.01) and recovery from anesthesia (p<0.01). The recovery from anesthesia group had more integrated network in the delta band compared to non-delirious controls. In contrast, hypoactive delirium showed a less integrated network in the alpha band. High accuracy for discrimination between hypoactive delirious patients and controls (86%) and recovery from anesthesia and controls (95%) were found. Accuracy for discrimination between hypoactive delirium and recovery from anesthesia was 73%.
Loss of functional and directed connectivity were observed in both hypoactive delirium and recovery from anesthesia, which might be related to the reduced level of consciousness in both states. These states could be distinguished in topology, which was a less integrated network during hypoactive delirium.

Determination of quasi-periodicities in electroencephalogram (EEG) is a candidate for quantifying the changes in the depth of anesthesia (DOA). In this paper, DOA monitoring capacity of periodicities detected using PRSA was quantified by assessing EEG signals collected from 56 patients during surgery. The method is compared with sample entropy (SampEn), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and permutation entropy (PE). The performance of quasi-periodicities defined by deceleration capacity and acceleration capacity was tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Pearson correlation coefficient. During the surgery, a significant difference ( ) in the quasi-periodicities was observed among three different stages under general anesthesia. There is a larger mean AUC and correlation coefficient of quasi-periodicities compared with SampEn, DFA, and PE using expert assessment of conscious level and bispectral index as the gold standard, respectively. Quasi-periodicities detected using PRSA in EEG signals are a powerful monitor of DOA and perform more accurate and robust results compared with SampEn, DFA, and PE.

However, some patients may present early Lance-Adams syndrome (LAS): under appropriate treatment, they can reach a satisfactory functional outcome. Our aim was to describe their profile, focusing on pharmacologic management in the ICU, time to return of awareness, and long-term prognosis.
Adults with early LAS (defined as generalized myoclonus within 96h, with epileptiform EEG within 48h after CA) were retrospectively identified in our CA registry between 2006 and 2016. Functional outcome was assessed through cerebral performance categories (CPC) at 3 months, CPC 1-2 defined good outcome.
Among 458 consecutive patients, 7 (1.5%) developed early LAS (4 women, median age 59 years). Within 72h after CA, in normothemia and off sedation, all showed preserved brainstem reflexes and localized pain. All patients were initially treated with valproate, levetiracetam and clonazepam; additional agents, including propofol and midazolam, were prescribed in the majority. First signs of awareness occurred after 3-23 days (median 11.8); 3/7 reached a good outcome at 3 months.
Early after CA, myoclonus together with a reactive, epileptiform EEG, preserved evoked potentials and brainstem reflexes suggests LAS. This condition was managed with a combination of highly dosed, large spectrum antiepileptic agents including propofol and midazolam. Even if awakening was at times delayed, good outcome occurred in a substantial proportion of patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28342959/

Differentiating between prolonged coma and irreversible cerebral damage can be challenging, therefore the utilization of a multimodal approach is recommended by international guidelines. Here, we discuss indications and advantages/disadvantages of available modalities for coma prognostication and describe new tools to improve our accuracy for outcome prediction.
Studies from the TTM era confirmed that combining neurological examination with electrophysiological assessment [electroencephalography (EEG) and somato-sensory evoked potentials (SSEP)] greatly improves coma prognostication. This combination is nowadays recognized as the most useful by many clinicians and appears widely applicable as part of initial patient assessment. Additional tests (serum neuron specific enolase and neuroimaging) may be most useful to orient clinical decisions in patients with prolonged coma. Advanced analysis of EEG and SSEP recordings and the emergence of quantitative pupillometry hold great promise.
Multimodal prognostication offers a comprehensive approach of anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and is increasingly used in postresuscitation care. Worldwide implementation and future advancements of available modalities, together with the increasing use of novel automated devices for quantitative neurological examination, may further optimize prognostic accuracy in the early ICU phase following cardiac arrest.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28323720/

Proper opening of the blood-brain barrier is crucial for the treatment, yet there are no means available for its real-time monitoring. The intact blood-brain barrier maintains a mV-level electrical potential difference between blood and brain tissue, giving rise to a measurable electrical signal at the scalp. Therefore, we used direct-current electroencephalography (DC-EEG) to characterize the spatiotemporal behavior of scalp-recorded slow electrical signals during blood-brain barrier opening. Nine anesthetized patients receiving chemotherapy were monitored continuously during 47 blood-brain barrier openings induced by carotid or vertebral artery mannitol infusion. Left or right carotid artery mannitol infusion generated a strongly lateralized DC-EEG response that began with a 2 min negative shift of up to 2000 μV followed by a positive shift lasting up to 20 min above the infused carotid artery territory, whereas contralateral responses were of opposite polarity. Vertebral artery mannitol infusion gave rise to a minimally lateralized and more uniformly distributed slow negative response with a posterior-frontal gradient. Simultaneously performed near-infrared spectroscopy detected a multiphasic response beginning with mannitol-bolus induced dilution of blood and ending in a prolonged increase in the oxy/deoxyhemoglobin ratio. The pronounced DC-EEG shifts are readily accounted for by opening and sealing of the blood-brain barrier. These data show that DC-EEG is a promising real-time monitoring tool for blood-brain barrier disruption augmented drug delivery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28319185/

We have recently designed a novel method for the assessment of HIE after CA. The method is based on estimating the severity of the brain injury by analyzing changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity while the patient is exposed to an anesthetic drug propofol in a controlled manner. In this paper, Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) was used to analyze EEG slow wave activity during anesthesia in ten post-CA patients. The recordings were made in the intensive care unit 36-48 hours after the CA in an experiment, during which the propofol infusion rate was incrementally decreased to determine the drug-induced changes in the EEG at different anesthetic levels. HHT was shown to successfully capture the changes in the slow wave activity to the behavior of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). While, in patients with good neurological outcome defined after a six-month control period, propofol induced a significant increase in the amplitude of IMFs representing the slow wave activity, the patients with poor neurological outcome were unable to produce such a response. Consequently, the proposed method offer substantial prognostic potential by providing a novel approach for early estimation of HIE after CA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28268686/

A literature search was performed to identify studies that evaluated the effect of dexmedetomidine on motor- or electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure durations and maximum mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) after ECT. Moreover, recovery time and post-ECT agitation were evaluated.
Six studies enrolling 166 patients in 706 ECT sessions were included.

This paper proposes a closed-loop automated drug administration approach to control Depth Of Hypnosis in anesthesia. In contrast with most of the existing research on anesthesia control which makes use of linear control strategies or their improved variants, the novelty of the present research lies in applying robust control strategy i.e. Sliding Mode Control to accurately control drug infusion. Based on the derived patient's model, the designed controller uses measurements from EEG to regulate DOH on Bispectral Index by controlling infusion rate of Propofol. The performance of the controller is investigated and characterized with real dataset of 8 patients undergoing surgery. Results of this in silico study indicate that for all the patients, with 0% overshoot observed, the steady state error lies in between ±5. Clinically, this implies that in all the cases, without any overdose, the controller maintains the desired DOH level for smooth conduction of surgical procedures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28236859/

Practically, anesthesia is only seen as too deep when evidence of burst-suppression is seen. We designed an experiment to help towards better assessment of individual anesthetic needs. First, to mark the Ce (effect-site concentration) of propofol at loss of response to calling name and gently shaking shoulders (LOR), we defined Ce-LOR. To mark the transient power increase in the alpha range (9-14 Hz), common to all patients, when propofol concentration gradually increases, we defined Ce-alpha as the highest recorded alpha power for Ce. We also defined Ce-OBS as the Ce of propofol at initial observation of burst-suppression.

Post-hoc analysis of reported clinical seizures during day 1-7 in the TTM-trial including their treatment, EEG-findings, and long-term neurological outcome. The trial randomised 939 comatose survivors to TTM at 33°C or 36°C with strict criteria for withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies. Sensitivity, specificity and false positive rate for poor outcome were reported for different types of seizures.
Clinical seizures were registered in 268 patients (29%), similarly distributed in both intervention arms. Early and late seizures were equally predictive of poor outcome. Myoclonic seizures were the most common (240 patients, 26%) and the most predictive of a poor outcome (sensitivity 36.1%, false positive rate 4.3%). Two patients with status myoclonus regained consciousness, one with a good neurological outcome, generating a false positive rate of poor outcome of 0.2% (95%CI 0.0-1.0).

The data set, ""awareness"" and ""anesthesia"" groups, each contained 558 samples, including patients who had undergone different types of surgeries.
EEG signals acquired from patients in an aware state or under anesthesia were decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) through empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Hilbert transform (HT) analyses were then performed on each IMF to determine the frequency spectra. The probability distributions of expected values of frequencies were generated for the same IMF in the two groups of patients. The corresponding statistical data, including analysis of variance tests, were also calculated. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to identify optimal frequency value to discriminate between the two states of consciousness.
The frequencies of the IMFs for aware patients were found to be higher than those for anesthetized patients. The optimal frequency threshold by using FFT (or HT) for IMF 1 was 21.08 (or 25.00) Hz. IMF1 performed the highest with respect to the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.993 for FFT (or 0.989 for HT); hence it can be applied as a useful classifier to distinguish between fully anesthetized patients and aware patients.
This paper proposes a method for identifying whether patients' state of consciousness during a range of surgery types is ""under anesthesia"" or ""aware."" Our method involves using EEG to characterize the depth of anesthesia through two frequency analysis techniques. On the basis of our analyses, we conclude that the performance of IMF1 is satisfactory in distinguishing between patients' states of consciousness during surgery requiring general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28110742/

Evoked potentials (EPs) and electroencephalogram (EEG) are non-invasive clinical neurophysiology tools that allow an objective assessment of the central nervous system's function at the bedside in intensive care unit (ICU). These tests are quite useful in diagnosing cerebral complications, and establishing the vital and functional prognosis in ICU. EEG keeps a particularly privileged importance in detecting seizures phenomena such as subclinical seizures and non-convulsive status epilepticus. Quantitative EEG (QEEG) analysis techniques commonly called EEG Brain mapping can provide obvious topographic displays of digital EEG signals characteristics, showing the potential distribution over the entire scalp including filtering, frequency, and amplitude analysis and color mapping. Evidences of usefulness of QEEG for seizures detection in ICU are provided by several recent studies. Furthermore, beyond detection of epileptic phenomena, changes of some QEEG panels are early warning indicators of sedation level as well as brain damage or dysfunction in ICU. EPs offer the opportunity for assessing brainstem's functional integrity, as well as subcortical and cortical brain areas. A multimodal use, combining EEG and various modalities of EPs is recommended since this allows a more accurate functional exploration of the brain and helps caregivers to tailor therapeutic measures according to neurological worsening trends and to anticipate the prognosis in ICU.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28110410/

In order to do this, many methods have been developed that process signals representing different modalities. Assessment of hypnosis requires cortical measures of the central nervous system (CNS); methods that assess analgesia concentrate on subcortical and spinal levels of the CNS; and neuromuscular transmission is a peripheral phenomenon. This article presents an overview of the current state of methods available for measuring each of these components.

28033111,Improved spectrum analysis in EEG for measure of depth of anesthesia based on phase-rectified signal averaging.,Physiological measurement,2017,"Liu Q, Chen YF, Fan SZ, Abbod MF, Shieh JS","The definition of the depth of anesthesia (DOA) is still controversial and its measurement is not completely standardized in modern anesthesia. Power spectral analysis is an important method for feature detection in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Several spectral parameters derived from EEG have been proposed for measuring DOA in clinical applications. In the present paper, an improved method based on phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) is designed to improve the predictive accuracy of relative alpha and beta power, a frequency band power ratio, total power, median frequency (MF), spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), and spectral entropy for assessing anesthetic drug effects. Fifty-six patients undergoing general anesthesia in an operating theatre are studied. All EEG signals are continuously recorded from the awake state to the end of the recovery state and then filtered using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). All parameters are evaluated using the commercial bispectral index (BIS) and expert assessment of conscious level (EACL), respectively. The ability to predict DOA is estimated using the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). All indicators based on the improved method can clearly discriminate the conscious state from the anesthetized state after filtration (p  <  0.05). A significantly larger mean AUC (p  <  0.05) shows that the improved method performs better than the conventional method to measure the DOA in most circumstances. Especially for raw EEG contaminated by artifacts, when the BIS index is used to indicate the consciousness level, the improvement is 7.37% (p  <  0.05), 9.04% (p  <  0.05), 18.46% (p  <  0.05), 27.73% (p  <  0.05), 14.65% (p  <  0.05), 2.52%, 5.38% and 6.24% (p  <  0.05) for relative alpha and beta power, power ratio, total power, MF, SEF, RE and SE, respectively. However, when the EACL is used to indicate the consciousness level, the improvement is 3.30% (p  <  0.05), 16.69% (p  <  0.05), 15.08% (p  <  0.05), 34.83% (p  <  0.05), 27.78% (p  <  0.05), 5.89% (p  <  0.05), 26.05% (p  <  0.05) and 23.42% (p  <  0.05).

The relative roles of cortex and thalamus in initiating and maintaining the different seizure types are unclear.
The purpose of the study is to estimate whether the cortex or the centromedian thalamic nucleus is leading in initiating and maintaining seizures in humans.
We report human ictal recordings with simultaneous thalamic and cortical electrodes from three patients without anesthesia being assessed for deep brain stimulation (DBS). Patients 1 and 2 had idiopathic generalized epilepsy whereas patient 3 had frontal lobe epilepsy. Visual inspection was combined with nonlinear correlation analysis.
In patient 1, seizure onset was bilateral cortical and the belated onset of leading thalamic discharges was associated with an increase in rhythmicity of discharges, both in thalamus and cortex. In patient 2, we observed bilateral independent interictal discharges restricted to the thalamus. However, ictal onset was diffuse, with discharges larger in the cortex even though they were led by the thalamus. In patient 3, seizure onset was largely restricted to frontal structures, with belated lagging thalamic involvement.
In human generalized seizures, the thalamus may become involved early or late in the seizure but, once it becomes involved, it leads the cortex. In contrast, in human frontal seizures the thalamus gets involved late in the seizure and, once it becomes involved, it lags behind the cortex. In addition, the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus is capable of autonomous epileptogenesis as suggested by the presence of independent focal unilateral epileptiform discharges restricted to thalamic structures. The thalamus may also be responsible for maintaining the rhythmicity of ictal discharges.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28030998/
28026746,Robust Estimation of Sparse Narrowband Spectra from Neuronal Spiking Data.,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2017,"Miran S, Purdon PL, Brown EN, Babadi B","Characterizing the spectral properties of neuronal responses is an important problem in computational neuroscience, as it provides insight into the spectral organization of the underlying functional neural processes. Although spectral analysis techniques are widely used in the analysis of noninvasive neural recordings such as EEG, their application to spiking data is limited due to the binary and nonlinear nature of neuronal spiking. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the power spectral density of the neural covariate driving the spiking statistics of a neuronal population from binary observations.
We consider a neuronal ensemble spiking according to Bernoulli statistics, for which the conditional intensity function is given by the logistic map of a harmonic second-order stationary process with sparse narrowband spectra. By employing sparsity-promoting priors, we compute the maximum a posteriori estimate of the power spectral density of the process from the binary spiking observations. Furthermore, we construct confidence intervals for these estimates by an efficient posterior sampling procedure.
We provide simulation studies which reveal that our method outperforms the existing methods for extracting the frequency content of spiking data. Application of our method to clinically recorded spiking data from a patient under general anesthesia reveals a striking resemblance between our estimated power spectral density and that of the local field potential signal. This result corroborates existing findings regarding the salient role of the local field potential as a major neural covariate of rhythmic cortical spiking activity under anesthesia.
Our technique allows us to analyze the harmonic structure of spiking activity in a robust fashion, independently of the local field potentials, and without any prior assumption of the spectral spread and content of the underlying neural processes.
Other than its usage in the spectral analysis of neuronal spiking data, our technique can be applied to a wide variety of binary data, such as heart beat data, in order to obtain a robust spectral representation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28026746/

We evaluated the effect of induced hypothermia on neurologic outcomes in patients with convulsive status epilepticus.
In a multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 270 critically ill patients with convulsive status epilepticus who were receiving mechanical ventilation to hypothermia (32 to 34°C for 24 hours) in addition to standard care or to standard care alone; 268 patients were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was a good functional outcome at 90 days, defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score of 5 (range, 1 to 5, with 1 representing death and 5 representing no or minimal neurologic deficit). The main secondary outcomes were mortality at 90 days, progression to electroencephalographically (EEG) confirmed status epilepticus, refractory status epilepticus on day 1, ""super-refractory"" status epilepticus (resistant to general anesthesia), and functional sequelae on day 90.
A GOS score of 5 occurred in 67 of 138 patients (49%) in the hypothermia group and in 56 of 130 (43%) in the control group (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 1.99; P=0.43).

EMD works well to decompose a time series into a set of intrinsic mode functions with specific frequency bands. An IMF therefore represents an intrinsic component on its correspondingly intrinsic frequency band. The word of 'intrinsic' means the frequency is totally adaptive to the nature of a signal. In this study, power density and nonlinearity are two critical parameters for characterizing the amplitude and frequency modulations in IMFs. In this study, a nonlinearity level is quantified using degree of waveform distortion (DWD), which represents the characteristic of waveform distortion as an assessment of the intra-wave modulation of an IMF. In the application of anesthesia EEG analysis, the assessments of power density and DWD for a set of IMFs represent dynamic responses in EEG caused by two different anesthesia agents, Ketamine and Alfentanil, on different frequency bands. Ketamine causes the increase of power density and the decrease of nonlinearity on γ-band neuronal oscillation, which cannot be found EEG responses of group B using Alfentanil. Both agents cause an increase of power density and a decrease of nonlinearity on β-band neuronal oscillation accompany with a loss of consciousness. Moreover, anesthesia agents cause the decreases of power density and nonlinearity (i.e. DWD) for the low-frequency IMFs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27973590/

Spine,2017,"Wilson B, Curtis E, Hirshman B, Oygar A, Chen K, Gabel BC, Vaida F, Allison DW, Ciacci JD","OBJECTIVE Normative data exists for stimulus-evoked pedicle screw electromyography (EMG) current thresholds in the lumbar spine, and is routinely referenced during spine surgeries to detect a screw breach, prevent injury of neural elements, and ensure the most biomechanically sound instrumentation construct. To date, similar normative data for cervical lateral mass screws is limited, thus the utility of lateral mass screw testing remains unclear. To address this disparity, in this study the authors describe cumulative lateral mass screw stimulation threshold data in patients undergoing posterior cervical instrumentation with lateral mass screws. These data are correlated with screw placement on postoperative imaging, and a novel correlation is discovered with direct clinical implications. METHODS Using a ball-tip probe, 154 lateral mass screws in 21 patients were electrically tested intraoperatively. In each case, for each screw, the lowest (or threshold) current at which the first polyphasic stimulus-evoked EMG response was reproducibly observed by a neurophysiologist was recorded. All patients underwent postoperative CT. Screw position within the lateral mass was first measured in the axial and sagittal planes for each lateral mass screw using the CT images. Screw placement was also evaluated by 2 independent physicians, blinded to current threshold data, on a binary scale of acceptability. The predictive capacity of screw EMG threshold data was evaluated via multivariable regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Predictive capacity was examined with respect to screw position within the lateral mass, as well as screw acceptability. RESULTS Lateral mass screw EMG thresholds did not appear to differ significantly for screws considered ""acceptable"" versus ""unacceptable"" according to the radiographic criteria. Accordingly, ROC analysis confirmed that EMG current threshold data were of minimal utility in predicting screw radiographic acceptability. However, EMG threshold was significantly predictive of screw medial distance from the spinal canal. A screw stimulating below 7.5 mA correctly identified a screw as being within 2 mm of the spinal canal with 75% sensitivity and 92% specificity (positive predictive value 20%, negative predictive value 99.3%), independent of its distance relative to other lateral mass landmarks. EMG current threshold was not significantly predictive of screw deviation in the superior or inferior directions, and was inversely predictive of screw deviations in the lateral direction. CONCLUSIONS In the context of uncertainty regarding the utility of cervical lateral mass EMG current threshold data, this study found that EMG current thresholds correspond significantly, and exclusively, with screw distance from the spinal canal. This association appears independent of other criteria for screw misplacement. As such, the authors recommend that EMG current thresholds be referenced in the case of a suspected medial breach as an effective means to rule out screw placement too medial to the spinal canal.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27935447/
27927806,Sleep Neurophysiological Dynamics Through the Lens of Multitaper Spectral Analysis.,"Physiology (Bethesda, Md.)",2017,"Prerau MJ, Brown RE, Bianchi MT, Ellenbogen JM, Purdon PL","During sleep, cortical and subcortical structures within the brain engage in highly structured oscillatory dynamics that can be observed in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The ability to accurately describe changes in sleep state from these oscillations has thus been a major goal of sleep medicine. While numerous studies over the past 50 years have shown sleep to be a continuous, multifocal, dynamic process, long-standing clinical practice categorizes sleep EEG into discrete stages through visual inspection of 30-s epochs. By representing sleep as a coarsely discretized progression of stages, vital neurophysiological information on the dynamic interplay between sleep and arousal is lost. However, by using principled time-frequency spectral analysis methods, the rich dynamics of the sleep EEG are immediately visible-elegantly depicted and quantified at time scales ranging from a full night down to individual microevents. In this paper, we review the neurophysiology of sleep through this lens of dynamic spectral analysis. We begin by reviewing spectral estimation techniques traditionally used in sleep EEG analysis and introduce multitaper spectral analysis, a method that makes EEG spectral estimates clearer and more accurate than traditional approaches. Through the lens of the multitaper spectrogram, we review the oscillations and mechanisms underlying the traditional sleep stages. In doing so, we will demonstrate how multitaper spectral analysis makes the oscillatory structure of traditional sleep states instantaneously visible, closely paralleling the traditional hypnogram, but with a richness of information that suggests novel insights into the neural mechanisms of sleep, as well as novel clinical and research applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27927806/

The survey was completed by 75 neurophysiologists that use QEEG in their practice. Survey respondents reported that neurophysiologists and neurophysiology fellows are most likely to serve as QEEG readers (97% and 52%, respectively). However, 21% of respondents reported nonneurophysiologists are also involved with QEEG interpretation. The majority of nonneurophysiologist QEEG data review is aimed to alert neurophysiologists to periods of concern, but 22% reported that nonneurophysiologists use QEEG to directly guide clinical care. Quantitative EEG was used most frequently for seizure detection (92%) and burst suppression monitoring (59%). A smaller number of respondents use QEEG for monitoring the depth of sedation (29%), ischemia detection (28%), vasospasm detection (28%) and prognosis after cardiac arrest (21%). About half of the respondents do not review every page of the raw critical care continuous EEG record when using QEEG. Respondents prefer a panel of QEEG trends displayed as hemispheric data, when applicable. There is substantial variability regarding QEEG trend preferences for seizure detection and ischemia detection.

We previously investigated whether IED could play a mechanistic role in SIDS. We discovered that animals with IED displayed significant suppression of movement arousal to a hypoxic-hypercarbic gas mixture under light anesthesia. In the current study we investigated the role of each gas in triggering movements and the response to hypercarbia during natural sleep without anesthesia. Seventeen-day-old CD-1 mice received intra-tympanic gentamicin (IT-Gent) injections to precipitate IED. The movement response to hypercarbia, hypoxia and hypoxia-hypercarbia was compared to controls under light anesthesia. Hypercarbia did not stimulate vigorous movements in any animals under either sleep condition. Hypoxia triggered vigorous movements in controls (p<0.05) and a decreased response in IT-Gent animals under light anesthesia. This contrasted with combined hypoxia-hypercarbia, in which IT-Gent animals displaced significantly suppressed movements compared to controls (p<0.05). Our findings portray that a degree of intact inner ear function is necessary for instigating the movement response.

In this study, the authors attempted to assess the potential added benefit to patient outcomes of ""awake"" neurological testing when compared with standard neurophysiological testing performed under general anesthesia. The procedure is performed after the induction of conscious sedation, and for the neurological testing, the patient is fully awake. METHODS The authors conducted an institutional review board-approved prospective study of clipping unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) in 30 consecutive adult patients who underwent awake clipping. The end points were the incidence of stroke/cerebrovascular accident (CVA), death, discharge to a long-term facility, length of stay, and 30-day modified Rankin Scale score. All clinical and neurophysiological intraoperative monitoring data were recorded. RESULTS The median patient age was 52 years (range 27-63 years); 19 (63%) female and 11 (37%) male patients were included. Twenty-seven (90%) aneurysms were anterior, and 3 (10%) were posterior circulation aneurysms. Five (17%) had been coiled previously, 3 (10%) had been clipped previously, 2 (7%) were partially calcified, and 2 (7%) were fusiform aneurysms. Three patients developed synchronous clinical neurological and neurophysiological changes during temporary clipping with consequent removal of the temporary clip and reversal of those clinical and neurophysiological changes. Three patients developed asynchronous clinical neurological and neurophysiological changes. These 3 patients developed hemiparesis without changes in neurophysiological monitoring results. One patient developed linked clinical neurological and neurophysiological changes during final clipping that were not reversed by reapplication of the clip, and the patient had a CVA. Four patients with internal carotid artery ophthalmic segment aneurysms underwent visual testing with final clipping, and 1 of these patients required repositioning of the clip. Three patients who required permanent occlusion of a vessel as part of their aneurysm treatment underwent a 10-minute intraoperative clinical respective-vessel test occlusion. The median length of stay was 3 days (range 1-5 days). The median modified Rankin Scale score was 1 (range 0-3). All of the patients were discharged to home from the hospital except for 1 who developed a CVA and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. There were no deaths in this series. CONCLUSIONS The 3 patients who developed neurological deterioration without a concomitant neurophysiological finding during temporary clipping revealed a potential advantage of awake aneurysm surgery (i.e., in decreasing the risk of ischemic injury).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27767401/
27270857,Evaluation of respiratory volume monitoring (RVM) to detect respiratory compromise in advance of pulse oximetry and help minimize false desaturation alarms.,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,2016,"Galvagno SM, Duke PG, Eversole DS, George EE","Monitoring respiratory function is important. By continuously monitoring respiratory volumes, respiratory depression could be identified before hypoxemia and drive earlier intervention. Here, we evaluate the temporal relationship of respiratory volume monitoring (providing real-time minute ventilation [MV], tidal volume, and respiratory rate in nonintubated patients) to hypoxemic episodes and its potential to help classify true vs false desaturations (related to patient movement/probe dislodgement).
Respiratory volume monitoring data, oxygen saturation (SpO2), oxygen supplementation, and opioid use were analyzed in 259 patients following orthopedic surgery. Detection of ""low MV"" (<40% of predicted MV) in advance of low SpO2 (<90%) was used to classify true and false desaturations. Patients were also stratified based on opioid use and development of low MV. Patient's length of stay (LOS) and number of SpO2 alarms were compared across groups (± opioids; ± low MV).
The electronic health records reported 113 SpO2 alarms; 105 (93%) not preceded by low MV and considered false. Low MV preceded the eight true desaturations by 12.8 ± 2.8 minutes. One hundred ninety-eight patients (76%) of 259 experienced one or more low MV events. Patients with low MV had significantly longer postanesthesia care unit (PACU) LOS than those maintaining ""adequate MV"": 2.8 ± 0.1 hours vs. 2.4 ± 0.1 hours (p < 0.001). Patients receiving opioids had increased likelihood of low MV (69% vs. 80%; p < 0.05) and had significantly longer PACU LOS than those without opioids (2.9 ± 0.1 hours vs. 2.3 ± 0.1 hours; p < 0.001). In the opioid group, PACU LOS was 75% longer in patients developing low MV versus maintaining adequate MV (3.0 ± 0.1 hours vs. 1.7 ± 0.2 hours; p < 0.001).
Respiratory volume monitoring can provide advanced warning of impending oxygen desaturation and potentially reduce the number of false SpO2 alarms. Opioid administration increased low MV events correlating with increased LOS. Respiratory volume monitoring can help clinicians individualize patient care, decrease false alarms, adjust opioid dosing, and increase PACU throughput. Similar benefits may translate to the general care floor and prehospital and posthospital environments.

This effort is currently limited by the need to collect raw EEG data directly from patients.
A procedural method to synthesize EEG signals was implemented in a mobile software application. The application is capable of sending the simulated signal to an anesthesia depth of hypnosis monitor. Systematic sweeps of the simulator generate functional monitor response profiles reminiscent of how network analyzers are used to test electronic components.
Three commercial anesthesia monitors (Entropy, NeuroSENSE, and BIS) were compared with this new technology, and significant response and feature variations between the monitor models were observed; this includes reproducible, nonmonotonic apparent multistate behavior and significant hysteresis at light levels of anesthesia.
Anesthesia monitor response to a procedural simulator can reveal significant differences in internal signal processing algorithms. The ability to synthesize EEG signals at different anesthetic depths potentially provides a new method for systematically testing EEG-based monitors and automated anesthesia systems with all sensor hardware fully operational before human trials.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27464979/

Continuous EEG monitoring is nonetheless a helpful neuromonitoring tool for patients receiving ECMO therapy because neurologic complications are frequent, but factors such as sedation, neuromuscular blockade, and hemodynamic instability limit clinical and radiographic evaluation. We examined whether using conductive plastic electrodes in place of conventional gold electrodes reduces artifact in clinical EEG studies of pediatric ECMO patients.
Four masked electroencephalographers assessed artifact and its impact on overall EEG interpretation in samples from 21 consecutive EEGs recorded during ECMO therapy (14 gold and 7 plastic). A spectral power analysis then quantified 50- to 70-Hz artifact in a larger group of 14 gold and 34 plastic electrode studies during ECMO and 4 non-ECMO gold electrode studies.
The masked electroencephalographers identified less artifact (P < 0.001) and indicated greater confidence in the accuracy of EEG interpretation (P < 0.001) among studies recorded with plastic electrodes. In quantitative analyses, ECMO was associated with greater 50- to 70-Hz power among studies using gold electrodes (P < 0.001) and gold electrodes exhibited greater 50- to 70-Hz power than plastic electrodes (P < 0.001). Contrasting studies in which most of the electroencephalographers believed that interpretation was (n = 12; 7 gold and 5 plastic) or was not (n = 7; all gold) compromised by artifact, 50- to 70-Hz power was similarly higher among the compromised studies (P < 0.001).

However, BAEPs yield limited information about the expected postoperative hearing quality and speech perception. The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) enables objective audiograms to be obtained in patients under anesthesia. These ASSRs could be used for intraoperative estimation of hearing classes to improve the postoperative outcome and quality of life. Studies investigating the clinical use of ASSRs during total intravenous anesthesia are currently lacking. The work presented in this article therefore investigates the application of ASSRs for intraoperative estimation of hearing classes. METHODS In 43 patients undergoing surgery for vestibular schwannoma, ASSR measurements were performed at the beginning and end of the surgical procedure. ASSR stimuli consisted of 80-dB hearing level amplitude-modulated tones with 5-minute duration, 90-Hz modulation, and 3 different carrier frequencies: 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz. Stimulation was performed unilaterally with and without contralateral masking, using single and combined carriers. Evoked responses were recorded and analyzed in the frequency domain. ASSRs were compared with extraoperative hearing classes and BAEPs using ANOVA, correlation, and receiver operating characteristic statistics. RESULTS ASSRs yielded high and consistent area under the curve (AUC) values (mean 0.83) and correlation values (mean -0.63), indicating reliable prediction of hearing classes. Analysis of BAEP amplitude changes showed lower AUC (mean 0.79) and correlation values (0.63, 0.37, and 0.50 for Waves I, III, and V, respectively). Latencies showed low AUC values (mean 0.6) and no significant correlation. Combination of several carriers for simultaneous evaluation reduced ASSR amplitudes and respective AUC values. Contralateral masking did not show a significant effect. CONCLUSIONS ASSRs robustly estimate hearing class in patients under total intravenous anesthesia, even when using short measurement durations. The method provides a diagnostic performance that exceeds conventional BAEP monitoring and enables objective and automated evaluation. On the basis of these findings, continuous intraoperative auditory monitoring could become a promising alternative or adjunct to BAEPs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27739939/
27723803,A Comparison of Multiscale Permutation Entropy Measures in On-Line Depth of Anesthesia Monitoring.,PloS one,2016,"Su C, Liang Z, Li X, Li D, Li Y, Ursino M","Multiscale permutation entropy (MSPE) is becoming an interesting tool to explore neurophysiological mechanisms in recent years. In this study, six MSPE measures were proposed for on-line depth of anesthesia (DoA) monitoring to quantify the anesthetic effect on the real-time EEG recordings. The performance of these measures in describing the transient characters of simulated neural populations and clinical anesthesia EEG were evaluated and compared.
Six MSPE algorithms-derived from Shannon permutation entropy (SPE), Renyi permutation entropy (RPE) and Tsallis permutation entropy (TPE) combined with the decomposition procedures of coarse-graining (CG) method and moving average (MA) analysis-were studied. A thalamo-cortical neural mass model (TCNMM) was used to generate noise-free EEG under anesthesia to quantitatively assess the robustness of each MSPE measure against noise. Then, the clinical anesthesia EEG recordings from 20 patients were analyzed with these measures. To validate their effectiveness, the ability of six measures were compared in terms of tracking the dynamical changes in EEG data and the performance in state discrimination. The Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was used to assess the relationship among MSPE measures.
CG-based MSPEs failed in on-line DoA monitoring at multiscale analysis. In on-line EEG analysis, the MA-based MSPE measures at 5 decomposed scales could track the transient changes of EEG recordings and statistically distinguish the awake state, unconsciousness and recovery of consciousness (RoC) state significantly. Compared to single-scale SPE and RPE, MSPEs had better anti-noise ability and MA-RPE at scale 5 performed best in this aspect. MA-TPE outperformed other measures with faster tracking speed of the loss of unconsciousness.
MA-based multiscale permutation entropies have the potential for on-line anesthesia EEG analysis with its simple computation and sensitivity to drug effect changes. CG-based multiscale permutation entropies may fail to describe the characteristics of EEG at high decomposition scales.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27723803/

More specifically, electroencephalogram recordings are now increasingly being used to relate drug-specific oscillatory dynamics to clinically desired altered arousal states. Dexmedetomidine is an anesthetic adjunct typically administered in operating rooms and intensive care units to produce and maintain a sedative brain state. However, a high-density electroencephalogram characterization of the neural correlates of the dexmedetomidine-induced altered arousal state has not been previously accomplished. Therefore, we administered dexmedetomidine (1mcg/kg bolus over 10 minutes, followed by 0.7mcg/kg/hr over 50 minutes) and recorded high-density electroencephalogram signals in healthy volunteers, 18-36 years old (n = 8). We analyzed the data with multitaper spectral and global coherence methods. We found that dexmedetomidine was associated with increased slow-delta oscillations across the entire scalp, increased theta oscillations in occipital regions, increased spindle oscillations in frontal regions, and decreased beta oscillations across the entire scalp. The theta and spindle oscillations were globally coherent. During recovery from this state, these electroencephalogram signatures reverted towards baseline signatures. We report that dexmedetomidine-induced electroencephalogram signatures more closely approximate the human sleep onset process than previously appreciated. We suggest that these signatures may be targeted by real time visualization of the electroencephalogram or spectrogram in clinical settings. Additionally, these signatures may aid the development of control systems for principled neurophysiological based brain-state targeting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27711165/

Sixty patients who were scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia (30 males/30 females) were enrolled. Patients were randomly allocated to receive one of 15 combinations of drug levels. Baseline electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded for 5 minutes prior to administering the drugs. Patients received a target-controlled infusion at one of four predefined doses of propofol (high, 3 μg/mL; medium, 1.5 μg/mL; low, 0.5 μg/mL; or no drug) and of remifentanil (high, 6 or 8 ng/mL; medium, 4 ng/mL; low, 2 ng/mL; or no drug).

Electroencephalographic approximate entropy (ApEn) and temporal linear mode complexity (TLMC) parameters at baseline and under steady state conditions were calculated off-line. Response surfaces were developed to map the interaction between propofol and remifentanil to the probability of occurrence for quantal responses (muscle rigidity, apnoea, LOC) and ApEn and TLMC measurements.

we prospectively analyzed treatment response, seizure outcome, and adverse effects of IV LCM in 38 patients with seizure emergencies (15 with SC, 23 with SE) during a hospital stay. The loading dose of IV LCM was 200-400mg and the maintenance dose was 200-400mg daily. Response to IV LCM was evaluated within 20min, 4h and 24h of LCM infusion.
an acute anti-seizure effect after IV LCM was especially evident when it was first used - (SC) or second line (established SE) treatment. In particular, 87% of SC patients (13/15) and 80% of established SE (8/10) demonstrated response to LCM treatment, while no patients with super-refractory SE (0/8) responded to IV LCM according to our criteria. The loading of IV LCM was well tolerated, with mild adverse effects (2/38 temporary dizziness). In most patients, during and after administration of the loading dose of IV LCM a temporary (30min-1h) sedation was observed. No ECG and laboratory values-changes were documented in any of the patients.

KD is a high-fat, restricted-carbohydrate regimen that may be administered with different fat to protein and carbohydrate ratios (3:1 and 4:1 fat to protein and carbohydrate ratios). Other ketogenic regimens have a lower fat and higher protein and carbohydrate ratio to improve taste and thus compliance to treatment. We describe a case of RSE treated with intravenous KD in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).
An 8-year-old boy was referred to the PICU because of continuous tonic-clonic and myoclonic generalized seizures despite several antiepileptic treatments. After admission he was intubated and treated with intravenous thiopental followed by ketamine. Seizures continued with frequent myoclonic jerks localized on the face and upper arms. EEG showed seizure activity with spikes on rhythmic continuous waves. Thus we decided to begin KD. The concomitant ileus contraindicated KD by the enteral route and we therefore began IV KD. The ketogenic regimen consisted of conventional intravenous fat emulsion, plus dextrose and amino-acid hyperalimentation in a 2:1 then 3:1 fat to protein and carbohydrate ratio. Exclusive IV ketogenic treatment, well tolerated, was maintained for 3 days; peristalsis then reappeared so KD was continued by the enteral route at 3:1 ratio. Finally, after 8 days and no seizure improvement, KD was deemed unsuccessful and was discontinued.

For instance, compared to wakefulness, during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep TMS elicits a larger positive-negative wave, fewer phase-locked oscillations, and an overall simpler response. However, many physiological variables also change when subjects go from wake to sleep, anesthesia, or coma. To avoid these confounding factors, we focused on NREM sleep only and measured TMS-evoked EEG responses before awakening the subjects and asking them if they had been conscious (dreaming) or not. As shown here, when subjects reported no conscious experience upon awakening, TMS evoked a larger negative deflection and a shorter phase-locked response compared to when they reported a dream. Moreover, the amplitude of the negative deflection-a hallmark of neuronal bistability according to intracranial studies-was inversely correlated with the length of the dream report (i.e., total word count). These findings suggest that variations in the level of consciousness within the same physiological state are associated with changes in the underlying bistability in cortical circuits.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27491799/

Fifteen centers returned the completed questionnaires. Data was available on 2098 patients. 863 patients (41.1%) were operated on through awake surgery and intraoperative mapping, while 1235 patients (58.8%) received asleep surgery and intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring or mapping.

We evaluated whether electroencephalography (EEG) and multimodality monitoring parameters may facilitate assessment of consciousness in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A retrospective analysis was performed of 83 consecutively treated adults with subarachnoid hemorrhage. All patients were initially comatose and had invasive brain monitoring placed. Behavioral assessments were performed during daily interruption of sedation and categorized into 3 groups based on their best examination as (1) comatose, (2) arousable (eye opening or attending toward a stimulus), and (3) aware (command following). EEG features included spectral power and complexity measures. Comparisons were made using bootstrapping methods and partial least squares regression.
We identified 389 artifact-free EEG clips following behavioral assessments. Increasing central gamma, posterior alpha, and diffuse theta-delta oscillations differentiated patients who were arousable from those in coma. Command following was characterized by a further increase in central gamma and posterior alpha, as well as an increase in alpha permutation entropy. These EEG features together with basic neurological examinations (eg, pupillary light reflex) contributed heavily to a linear model predicting behavioral state, whereas brain physiology measures (eg, brain oxygenation), structural injury, and clinical course added less.
EEG measures of behavioral states provide distinctive signatures that complement behavioral assessments of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage shortly after the injury.

We analyzed stored multichannel electroencephalographic (EEG) data collected from 12 pediatric patients with generalized SE. EEG recordings were initially segmented in 500ms time-windows. Features characterizing the power, frequency, and entropy of the signal were extracted from each segment. The segments were annotated as bursts (B), suppressions (S), or artifacts (A) by two electroencephalographers. The EEG features together with the annotations were inputted in a three-layer feed forward neural network (NN). The sensitivity and specificity of NNs with different architectures and training algorithms to classify segments into B, S, or A were estimated.
The maximum sensitivity (95.96% for B, 89.25% for S, and 75% for A) and specificity (89.36 for B, 96.26% for S, and 99.8% for A) was observed for the NN with 10 nodes in the hidden layer. By using this NN, we designed a real-time system that estimates the burst-suppression index (BSI).
Our system provides a reliable real-time estimate of multichannel BSI requiring minimal memory and computation time.
The system has the potential to assist intensive care unit attendants in the continuous EEG monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27417058/
27411333,A novel multivariate STeady-state index during general ANesthesia (STAN).,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2017,"Castro A, de Almeida FG, Amorim P, Nunes CS","The assessment of the adequacy of general anesthesia for surgery, namely the nociception/anti-nociception balance, has received wide attention from the scientific community. Monitoring systems based on the frontal EEG/EMG, or autonomic state reactions (e.g. heart rate and blood pressure) have been developed aiming to objectively assess this balance. In this study a new multivariate indicator of patients' steady-state during anesthesia (STAN) is proposed, based on wavelet analysis of signals linked to noxious activation. A clinical protocol was designed to analyze precise noxious stimuli (laryngoscopy/intubation, tetanic, and incision), under three different analgesic doses; patients were randomized to receive either remifentanil 2.0, 3.0 or 4.0 ng/ml. ECG, PPG, BP, BIS, EMG and [Formula: see text] were continuously recorded. ECG, PPG and BP were processed to extract beat-to-beat information, and [Formula: see text] curve used to estimate the respiration rate. A combined steady-state index based on wavelet analysis of these variables, was applied and compared between the three study groups and stimuli (Wilcoxon signed ranks, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests). Following institutional approval and signing the informed consent thirty four patients were enrolled in this study (3 excluded due to signal loss during data collection). The BIS index of the EEG, frontal EMG, heart rate, BP, and PPG wave amplitude changed in response to different noxious stimuli. Laryngoscopy/intubation was the stimulus with the more pronounced response [Formula: see text]. These variables were used in the construction of the combined index STAN; STAN responded adequately to noxious stimuli, with a more pronounced response to laryngoscopy/intubation (18.5-43.1 %, [Formula: see text]), and the attenuation provided by the analgesic, detecting steady-state periods in the different physiological signals analyzed (approximately 50 % of the total study time). A new multivariate approach for the assessment of the patient steady-state during general anesthesia was developed. The proposed wavelet based multivariate index responds adequately to different noxious stimuli, and attenuation provided by the analgesic in a dose-dependent manner for each stimulus analyzed in this study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27411333/

The use of the bispectral index (BIS) for monitoring depth of anesthesia during different types of surgery, including epilepsy surgery, is increasing nowadays. The BIS is an EEG-derived variable indicating cortical electrical activity. However, the correlation between the BIS score and the iECoG score, with the purpose of optimizing the quality and time of the iECoG recordings in epilepsy surgery is unknown. The goal of this study was to evaluate the correlation between BIS values and iECoG parameters during the epilepsy surgery under anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl. This is a prospective study that included patients with epilepsy who underwent epilepsy surgery guided by BIS and iECoG (September 2008 to October 2013). Clinical, physiological, and sociodemographic characteristics are shown. We correlated the iECoG parameters (presence of burst suppressions [BS], suppression time [seconds], background frequency [Hz], and type of iECoG score by Mathern et al) with BIS values. We included 28 patients, 15/28 (53.5%) female, general mean age of 30.5 years (range 13-56 years). Patients underwent epilepsy surgery: 22/28 (79%) temporal and 6/28 (21%) extratemporal. We found a nonlinear polynomial cubic relationship between the mentioned variables noting that a BIS range of 40 to 60 gave the following results: iECoG BS periods <5 seconds, background frequency 10 to 17 Hz, and iECoG score 2 characterized by lack of >20-Hz background frequencies. No BS were observed with a BIS > 60. In conclusion BIS values and iECoG parameters during the epilepsy surgery under anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl have a nonlinear correlation. BS patterns were not found with a BIS > 60. These findings show that BIS is a nonlinear multidimensional measure, which possesses high variability with the iECoG parameters. BS patterns are not found with BIS > 60.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27325591/

Firstly, the measured EEG signals are denoised and decomposed into 20 different frequency bands. The Mobility (M), permutation entropy (PE) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LCZ) of each frequency band are calculated. The M, PE and LCZ values of beta frequency bands (21.5-30 Hz) are selected to derive a new index. The new index is evaluated and compared with measured bispectral (BIS). The results show that there is a very close correlation between the proposed index and the BIS during different anaesthetic states. The new index also shows a 25-264 s earlier time response than BIS during the transient period of anaesthetic states. In addition, the proposed index is able to continuously assess the DoA when the quality of signal is poor and the BIS does not have any valid outputs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27323760/

The objective is to assess the hypotheses that this can be overcome by tracking distributions of linear models using anesthesia data, and that anesthetic brain state tracking performance of linear models is comparable to that of a high performing depth of anesthesia monitoring feature.
Individuals' brain states are classified by comparing the distribution of linear (auto-regressive moving average-ARMA) model parameters estimated from electroencephalographic (EEG) data obtained with a sliding window to distributions of linear model parameters for each brain state. The method is applied to frontal EEG data from 15 subjects undergoing propofol anesthesia and classified by the observers assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale. Classification of the OAA/S score was performed using distributions of either ARMA parameters or the benchmark feature, Higuchi fractal dimension.
The highest average testing sensitivity of 59% (chance sensitivity: 17%) was found for ARMA (2,1) models and Higuchi fractal dimension achieved 52%, however, no statistical difference was observed. For the same ARMA case, there was no statistical difference if medians are used instead of distributions (sensitivity: 56%).
The model-based distribution approach is not necessarily more effective than a median/short-term average approach, however, it performs well compared with a distribution approach based on a high performing anesthesia monitoring measure.
These techniques hold potential for anesthesia monitoring and may be generally applicable for tracking brain states.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27323352/

This geriatric syndrome is associated with longer intensive care unit and hospital stay, readmission, persistent cognitive deterioration and mortality. No effective preventive methods have been identified, but preliminary evidence suggests that EEG monitoring during general anaesthesia, by facilitating reduced anaesthetic exposure and EEG suppression, might decrease incident postoperative delirium. This study hypothesises that EEG-guidance of anaesthetic administration prevents postoperative delirium and downstream sequelae, including falls and decreased quality of life.
This is a 1232 patient, block-randomised, double-blinded, comparative effectiveness trial. Patients older than 60, undergoing volatile agent-based general anaesthesia for major surgery, are eligible. Patients are randomised to 1 of 2 anaesthetic approaches. One group receives general anaesthesia with clinicians blinded to EEG monitoring. The other group receives EEG-guidance of anaesthetic agent administration. The outcomes of postoperative delirium (≤5 days), falls at 1 and 12 months and health-related quality of life at 1 and 12 months will be compared between groups. Postoperative delirium is assessed with the confusion assessment method, falls with ProFaNE consensus questions and quality of life with the Veteran's RAND 12-item Health Survey. The intention-to-treat principle will be followed for all analyses. Differences between groups will be presented with 95% CIs and will be considered statistically significant at a two-sided p<0.05.

However, recent research has shown that the sleeping brain is not completely disconnected from its environment. How neural activity constrains the ability to process sensory information while asleep is yet unclear. Here, we instructed human volunteers to classify words with lateralized hand responses while falling asleep. Using an electroencephalographic (EEG) marker of motor preparation, we show how responsiveness is modulated across sleep. These modulations are tracked using classic event-related potential analyses complemented by Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc), a measure shown to track arousal in sleep and anesthesia. Neural activity related to the semantic content of stimuli was conserved in light non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. However, these processes were suppressed in deep NREM sleep and, importantly, also in REM sleep, despite the recovery of wake-like neural activity in the latter. In NREM sleep, sensory activations were counterbalanced by evoked down states, which, when present, blocked further processing of external information. In addition, responsiveness markers correlated positively with baseline complexity, which could be related to modulation in sleep depth. In REM sleep, however, this relationship was reversed. We therefore propose that, in REM sleep, endogenously generated processes compete with the processing of external input. Sleep can thus be seen as a self-regulated process in which external information can be processed in lighter stages but suppressed in deeper stages. Last, our results suggest drastically different gating mechanisms in NREM and REM sleep.
Previous research has tempered the notion that sleepers are isolated from their environment. Here, we pushed this idea forward and examined, across all sleep stages, the brain's ability to flexibly process sensory information, up to the decision level. We extracted an EEG marker of motor preparation to determine the completion of the sensory processing chain and explored how it is constrained by baseline and evoked neural activity. In NREM sleep, slow waves elicited by stimuli appeared to block response preparation. We also used a novel analytic approach (Lempel-Ziv complexity) and showed that the ability to process external information correlates with neural complexity. A reversal of the correlation between complexity and motor indices in REM sleep suggests drastically different gating mechanisms across sleep stages.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27307244/

Simulation of ATN destruction in animals demonstrated its high efficacy for both preventing the seizure development and reducing the seizure rate. However, bilateral radiofrequency destruction of the anterior thalamic nuclei in humans has not yet bee described.
The study objective was to perform bilateral radiofrequency anterior thalamotomy in intractable epilepsy patients and to evaluate its
We performed for the first time bilateral stereotactic radiofrequency thermocoagulation of ATN in 13 patients with long-term intractable epilepsy. Before surgery, we assessed the disease duration, age of seizure onset, localization of pathological activity sources, and types of seizures, morphological damages, and ongoing pharmacotherapy. All interventions were performed under local anesthesia and were accompanied by intraoperative microelectrode monitoring of the neuronal activity and by EEG.
Seven males and 6 females, aged 22 to 48 years, were operated on. All patients had epileptogenic foci in the frontal and/or temporal lobes. MRI revealed epileptogenic structural abnormalities in 3 patients. There were no postoperative complications. According to a postoperative examination, 5 patients were seizure-free; a decrease in the seizure rate was 70% in 6 patients and 50% in 1 patient; 1 patient had no response to the surgery. The resulting effect was manifested not only in a reduction in the frequency and severity of seizures but also in a decrease in the dose of administered anticonvulsants. EEG also showed a significant improvement in the majority of patients.
Our experience demonstrates that bilateral radiofrequency anterior thalamotomy is a safe and effective technique to control seizures in humans. Further research will clarify, based on the clinical and EEG data, the patient selection criteria for surgical treatment.
Актуальность. Выявление важной роли передних таламических ядер Anterior Thalamic Nuclei (ATN) в генерализации судорог привело к повышению интереса к хирургическим вмешательствам в этой области у пациентов с фармакорезистентной эпилепсией. Моделирование на животных показало высокую эффективность деструкций ATN в предупреждении развития и снижении частоты приступов. Однако двусторонняя радиочастотная деструкция ATN у человека до сих пор не была описанa. Цель исследования - выполнить и оценить результаты двусторонней радиочастотной передней таламотомии у пациентов с фармакорезистентной эпилепсией. Материал и методы. Нами впервые была выполнена двусторонняя стереотаксическая радиочастотная термокоагуляция ATN 13 пациентам, длительно страдавшим фармакорезистентной эпилепсией. Перед операцией определяли длительность заболевания, возраст начала приступов, локализацию источников патологической активности, тип приступов и морфологические повреждения, а также оценивали проводимую фармакотерапию. Все вмешательства были осуществлены под местной анестезией и сопровождались интраоперационной микроэлектродной регистрацией нейрональной активности и записью электроэнцефалограммы (ЭЭГ). Результаты. Оперированы 7 мужчин и 6 женщин в возрасте от 22 до 48 лет. У всех пациентов эпилептогенные очаги локализовались в лобных и/или височных долях мозга. МРТ выявила эпилептогенные структурные аномалии у 3 пациентов. Послеоперационных осложнений не было. При дальнейшем обследовании 5 пациентов отметили отсутствие приступов, у 6 - снижение частоты приступов составило более 70%, у 1 - 50% и у 1 пациента не последовало ответа на проведенное вмешательство. Достигнутый эффект выражался не только в снижении частоты и тяжести приступов, но и в уменьшении доз принимаемых противосудорожных препаратов. ЭЭГ также подтвердила значительное улучшение у подавляющего большинства пациентов. Заключение. Наш опыт показывает, что двусторонняя радиочастотная передняя таламотомия является безопасным и эффективным методом контроля судорожных приступов у человека.

In individuals without known brain pathologies undergoing deep general anesthesia, somatosensory stimulation transiently increases the occurrence of bursts. We investigated the reactivity of burst-suppression in children with acquired brain injury.
Intensive care unit electroencephalographic monitoring recordings containing burst-suppression were obtained from 5 comatose children with acquired brain injury of various etiologies. Intermittent photic stimulation was performed at 1Hz for 1min to assess reactivity. We quantified reactivity by measuring the change in the burst ratio (fraction of time in burst) following photic stimulation.
Photic stimulation evoked bursts in all patients, resulting in a transient increase in the burst ratio, while the mean heart rate remained unchanged. The regression slope of the change in burst ratio, referred to as the standardized burst ratio reactivity, correlated with subjects' Glasgow Coma Scale scores.

Sedation level can be measured with EEG monitoring with the bispectral index (BIS) monitor.
To determine the feasibility and validity of BIS monitoring in terminally ill patients.
In this prospective study, BIS registrations were performed in unconscious end-of-life patients admitted to a palliative care center. Validated scores were used to measure level of sedation (Ramsay score), pain (Numeric Rating Scale or Rotterdam Elderly Pain Observations Scale), delirium (Delirium Observation Screening score), and overall comfort (Numeric Rating Scale). Validity and sensitivity to change of BIS values were considered, and the effects of medication and the time till death on BIS values were evaluated in a linear mixed model analysis.
Fifty-eight patients were included for analysis. BIS monitoring was acceptable to patients, relatives, and medical staff. BIS values were moderately correlated with Ramsay scores (0.46) but were highly variable for deeply sedated patients. BIS values changed significantly before and after a midazolam dose (P < 0.001). Midazolam treatment resulted on average in a statistically significant reduction of the BIS values (-4.5, 95% CI -7.0 to -2.0), whereas morphine and haloperidol did not.
This is one of the first validation studies in which BIS monitoring in end-of-life patients is described. BIS monitoring is feasible in unconscious terminally ill patients.

Enhanced gamma amino-butyric acid A (GABAA) inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) manifest with large-amplitude slow (0.1-1Hz) and frontally coherent alpha (8-12Hz) EEG oscillations during general anesthesia. Therefore, we investigated the EEG signatures of modern day derivatives of ether (MDDE) anesthesia to assess the extent to which we could obtain insights into MDDE anesthetic mechanisms.
We retrospectively studied cases from our database in which patients received isoflurane anesthesia vs. isoflurane/ketamine anesthesia (n=10 each) or desflurane anesthesia vs. desflurane/ketamine anesthesia (n=9 each). We analyzed the EEG recordings with spectral power and coherence methods.
Similar to known GABAA circuit level mechanisms, we found that MDDE anesthesia induced large amplitude slow and frontally coherent alpha oscillations. Additionally, MDDE anesthesia also induced frontally coherent theta (4-8Hz) oscillations. Reduction of GABAergic IPSCs with ketamine resulted in beta/gamma (13-40Hz) oscillations, and significantly reduced MDDE anesthesia-induced slow, theta and alpha oscillation power.
Large amplitude slow oscillations and coherent alpha and theta oscillations are moderated by ketamine during MDDE anesthesia.

However, this mechanism was recently demonstrated at subanesthetic doses of ketamine in awake-patients. Therefore, we investigated whether there is an electroencephalogram (EEG) signature specific for ketamine anesthesia-induced unconsciousness.
We retrospectively studied the EEG in 12 patients who received ketamine for the induction of general anesthesia. We analyzed the EEG dynamics using power spectral and coherence methods.

In this study, the authors compared the effects of desflurane on facial motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the spasm and nonspasm sides of patients who were undergoing microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery to test the hypothesis that HFS is associated with a central elevation of facial motor neuron excitability. METHODS Facial MEPs were elicited in 31 patients who were undergoing MVD for HFS and were administered total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with or without additional desflurane, an inhaled anesthetic known to centrally suppress MEPs. All measurements were completed before dural opening while a consistent mean arterial blood pressure was maintained and electroencephalography was performed. The activation threshold voltage and mean amplitudes of the MEPs from both sides of the face were compared. RESULTS There was a significantly lower mean activation threshold of facial MEPs on the spasm side than on the nonspasm side (mean ± SD 162.9 ± 10.1 vs 198.3 ± 10.1 V, respectively; p = 0.01). In addition, MEPs were also elicited more readily when single-pulse transcranial electrical stimulation was used on the spasm side (74% vs 31%, respectively; p = 0.03). Although desflurane (1 minimum alveolar concentration) suppressed facial MEPs on both sides, the suppressive effects of desflurane were less on the spasm side than on the nonspasm side (59% vs 79%, respectively; p = 0.03), and M waves recorded from the mentalis muscle remained unchanged, which indicates that desflurane did not affect the peripheral facial nerve or neuromuscular junction. CONCLUSIONS Centrally acting inhaled anesthetic agents can suppress facial MEPs and therefore might interfere with intraoperative monitoring. The elevated motor neuron excitability and differential effects of desflurane between the spasm and nonspasm sides support a mechanism of central pathophysiology in HFS.

Although sleep stages can be assessed by polysomnography (PSG), acquisition and interpretation of PSG is costly, is labor intensive, is difficult to do over an extended period of time with critically ill patients (multiple days of continuous recording), and may interfere with patient care. In this pilot study, we investigated the feasibility and utility of monitoring sleep in the ICU setting using a portable electroencephalography (EEG) monitor, the SedLine brain monitor.
We first performed a baseline comparison study of the SedLine brain monitor by comparing its recordings to PSG recorded in a sleep laboratory (n = 3). In a separate patient cohort, we enrolled patients in the ICU who were monitored continuously with the SedLine monitor for sleep disruption (n = 23). In all enrolled patients, we continuously monitored their EEG. The raw EEG was retrieved and sleep stages and arousals were analyzed by a board-certified technologist. Delirium was measured by a trained research nurse using the Confusion Assessment Method developed for the ICU.
For all enrolled patients, we continuously monitored their EEGs and were able to retrieve the raw EEGs for analysis of sleep stages. Overall, the SedLine brain monitor was able to differentiate sleep stages, as well as capture arousals and transitions between sleep stages compared with the PSG performed in the sleep laboratory. The percentage agreement was 67% for the wake stage, 77% for the non-rapid eye movement (REM) stage (N1 = 29%, N2 = 88%, and N3 = 6%), and 89% for the REM stage. The overall agreement was measured with the use of weighted kappa, which was 0.61, 95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.64. In the ICU study, the mean recording time for the 23 enrolled patients was 19.10 hours. There were several signs indicative of poor-quality sleep, where sleep was distributed throughout the day, with reduced time spent in REM (1.38% ± 2.74% of total sleep time), and stage N3 (2.17% ± 5.53% of total sleep time) coupled with a high arousal index (34.63 ± 19.04 arousals per hour). The occurrence of ICU delirium was not significantly different between patients with and without sleep disruption.
Our results suggest the utility of a portable EEG monitor to measure different sleep stages, transitions, and arousals; however, the accuracy in measuring different sleep stages by the SedLine monitor varies compared with PSG. Our results also support previous findings that sleep is fragmented in critically ill patients.

The aim of this study was to identify associations between candidate circadian gene variants and the polysomnogram, recorded under highly controlled laboratory conditions during a baseline, overnight, 8 h sleep opportunity. A candidate gene approach was employed to analyze single-nucleotide polymorphisms from five circadian-related genes in a two-phase analysis of 84 healthy young adults (28 F; 23.21 ± 2.97 years) of European ancestry. A common variant in Period2 (PER2) was associated with 20 min less slow-wave sleep (SWS) in carriers of the minor allele than in noncarriers, representing a 22% reduction in SWS duration. Moreover, spectral analysis in a subset of participants (n = 37) showed the same PER2 polymorphism was associated with reduced EEG power density in the low delta range (0.25-1.0 Hz) during non-REM sleep and lower slow-wave activity (0.75-4.5 Hz) in the early part of the sleep episode. These results indicate the involvement of PER2 in the homeostatic process of sleep. Additionally, a rare variant in Melatonin Receptor 1B was associated with longer REM sleep latency, with minor allele carriers exhibiting an average of 65 min (87%) longer latency from sleep onset to REM sleep, compared to noncarriers. These findings suggest that circadian-related genes can modulate sleep architecture and the sleep EEG, including specific parameters previously implicated in the homeostatic regulation of sleep.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27089043/

We report an acute symptomatic seizure occurring during a surgical procedure in a patient who did not have a prior history of epilepsy and who did not have a lesion associated with an increased risk of epilepsy. To characterize the incidence and clinical features of intraoperative seizures during craniotomy under general anesthesia, we reviewed cases where continuous EEG was acquired during craniotomy.
Records of 400 consecutive cases with propofol as general anesthesia during craniotomy were reviewed. Demographic data, indication for surgery, clinical history, history of prior seizures, duration of surgery and duration of burst suppression were recorded. Cases where seizures were observed were analyzed in detail.
Two out of 400 patients experienced intraoperative seizures, including one patient who appeared to have an acute symptomatic seizure related to the surgical procedure itself and a second patient who experienced two seizures likely related to an underlying diagnosis of epilepsy.
This is the first report of an acute symptomatic seizure secondary to a neurosurgical procedure. Overall, 0.5% of patients monitored experienced seizures, indicating that intraoperative seizures are rare, and EEG monitoring during craniotomies is of low yield in detecting seizures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27082030/

Industry practices as they relate to preclinical seizure liability and sleep assessments are not well characterized and the extent of preclinical EEG testing varies between organizations. In the current paper, we discuss the various aspects of preclinical EEG to characterize drug-induced seizure risk and sleep disturbances, as well as describe the use of these data in a regulatory context. An overview of EEG technology-its correct application and its limitations, as well as best practices for setting up the animal models is presented.

26981889,Indicators for Remission of Suicidal Ideation Following Magnetic Seizure Therapy in Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression.,JAMA psychiatry,2016,"Sun Y, Farzan F, Mulsant BH, Rajji TK, Fitzgerald PB, Barr MS, Downar J, Wong W, Blumberger DM, Daskalakis ZJ","Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a novel therapeutic option for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Suicidal ideation is often associated with TRD and contributes to the increased mortality and morbidity of the disorder.
To identify a biomarker that may serve as an indicator of remission of suicidal ideation following a course of MST by using cortical inhibition measures from interleaved transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG).
Thirty-three patients with TRD were part of an open-label clinical trial of MST treatment. Data from 27 patients (82%) were available for analysis in this study. Baseline TMS-EEG measures were assessed within 1 week before the initiation of MST treatment using the TMS-EEG measures of cortical inhibition (ie, N100 and long-interval cortical inhibition [LICI]) from the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left motor cortex, with the latter acting as a control site.
The MST treatments were administered under general anesthesia, and a stimulator coil consisting of 2 individual cone-shaped coils was used.
Suicidal ideation was evaluated before initiation and after completion of MST using the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI). Measures of cortical inhibition (ie, N100 and LICI) from the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were selected. N100 was quantified as the amplitude of the negative peak around 100 milliseconds in the TMS-evoked potential (TEP) after a single TMS pulse. LICI was quantified as the amount of suppression in the double-pulse TEP relative to the single-pulse TEP.
Of the 27 patients included in the analyses, 15 (56%) were women; mean (SD) age of the sample was 46.0 (15.3) years. At baseline, patients had a mean SSI score of 9.0 (6.8), with 8 of 27 patients (30%) having a score of 0. After completion of MST, patients had a mean SSI score of 4.2 (6.3) (pre-post treatment mean difference, 4.8 [6.7]; paired t26 = 3.72; P = .001), and 18 of 27 individuals (67%) had a score of 0 for a remission rate of 53%. The N100 and LICI in the frontal cortex-but not in the motor cortex-were indicators of remission of suicidal ideation with 89% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 89% specificity (area under the curve, 0.90; P = .003).
These results suggest that cortical inhibition may be used to identify patients with TRD who are most likely to experience remission of suicidal ideation following a course of MST. Stronger inhibitory neurotransmission at baseline may reflect the integrity of transsynaptic networks that are targeted by MST for optimal therapeutic response.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26981889/
26976247,Spectral entropy monitoring for adults and children undergoing general anaesthesia.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2016,"Chhabra A, Subramaniam R, Srivastava A, Prabhakar H, Kalaivani M, Paranjape S","Anaesthetic drugs during general anaesthesia are titrated according to sympathetic or somatic responses to surgical stimuli. It is now possible to measure depth of anaesthesia using electroencephalography (EEG). Entropy, an EEG-based monitor can be used to assess the depth of anaesthesia using a strip of electrodes applied to the forehead, and this can guide intraoperative anaesthetic drug administration.
The primary objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of entropy monitoring in facilitating faster recovery from general anaesthesia. We also wanted to assess mortality at 24 hours, 30 days, and one year following general anaesthesia with entropy monitoring.The secondary objectives were to assess the effectiveness of the entropy monitor in: preventing postoperative recall of intraoperative events (awareness) following general anaesthesia; reducing the amount of anaesthetic drugs used; reducing cost of the anaesthetic as well as in reducing time to readiness to leave the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU).
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1990 to September 2014) and EMBASE via Ovid SP (1990 to September 2014). We reran the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE via Ovid SP and EMBASE via Ovid SP in January 2016. We added one potential new study of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting Classification' and we will incorporate this study into the formal review findings during the review update.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in adults and children (aged greater than two years of age), where in one arm entropy monitoring was used for titrating anaesthesia, and in the other standard practice (increase in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, lacrimation, movement in response to noxious surgical stimuli) was used for titrating anaesthetic drug administration. We also included trials with an additional third arm, wherein another EEG monitor, the Bispectral index (BIS) monitor was used to assess anaesthetic depth.
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently extracted details of trial methodology and outcome data from trials considered eligible for inclusion. All analyses were made on an intention-to-treat basis. We used a random-effect model where there was heterogeneity. For assessments of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome that included pooled data from RCTs, we downgraded evidence from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect or potential publication bias).
We included 11 RCTs (962 participants). Eight RCTs (762 participants) were carried out on adults (18 to 80 years of age), two (128 participants) involved children (two to 16 years) and one RCT (72 participants) included patients aged 60 to 75 years. Of the 11 included studies, we judged three to be at low risk of bias, and the remaining eight RCTs at unclear or high risk of bias.Six RCTs (383 participants) estimated the primary outcome, time to awakening after stopping general anaesthesia, which was reduced in the entropy as compared to the standard practice group (mean difference (MD) -5.42 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.77 to -2.08; moderate quality of evidence). We noted heterogeneity for this outcome; on performing subgroup analysis this was found to be due to studies that included participants undergoing major, long duration surgeries (off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, major urological surgery). The MD for time to awakening with four studies on ambulatory procedures was -3.20 minutes (95% CI -3.94 to -2.45). No trial reported the second primary outcome, mortality at 24 hours, 30 days, and one year with the use of entropy monitoring.Eight trials (797 participants) compared the secondary outcome, postoperative recall of intraoperative events (awareness) in the entropy and standard practice groups. Awareness was reported by only one patient in the standard practice group, making meaningful estimation of benefit of entropy monitoring difficult; moderate quality of evidence.All 11 RCTs compared the amount of anaesthetic agent used between the entropy and standard practice groups. Six RCTs compared the amount of propofol, four compared the amount of sevoflurane and one the amount of isoflurane used between the groups. Analysis of three studies (166 participants) revealed that the MD of propofol consumption between the entropy group and control group was -11.56 mcg/kg/min (95% CI -24.05 to 0.92); low quality of evidence. Analysis of another two studies (156 participants) showed that the MD in sevoflurane consumption in the entropy group compared to the control group was -3.42 mL (95% CI -6.49 to -0.35); moderate quality of evidence.No trial reported on the secondary outcome of the cost of general anaesthesia.Three trials (170 participants) estimated MD in time to readiness to leave the PACU of the entropy group as compared to the control group (MD -5.94 minutes, 95% CI -16.08 to 4.20; low quality of evidence). Heterogeneity was noted, which was due to the difference in anaesthetic technique (propofol-based general anaesthesia) in one study. The remaining two studies had used volatile-based general anaesthesia. The MD in time to readiness to leave the PACU was -4.17 minutes (95% CI -6.84 to -1.51) with these two studies.
The evidence as regards time to awakening, recall of intraoperative awareness and reduction in inhalational anaesthetic agent use was of moderate quality. The quality of evidence of as regards reduction in intravenous anaesthetic agent (propofol) use, as well as time to readiness to leave the PACU was found to be of low quality. As the data are limited, further studies consisting of more participants will be required for ascertaining benefits of entropy monitoring.Further studies are needed to assess the effect of entropy monitoring on focal issues such as short-term and long-term mortality, as well as cost of general anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26976247/

In this study, the influence of depth of anesthesia on MEP response was assessed. METHODS Twenty-eight patients with brain tumors who underwent awake craniotomy were included in this study. From a state of deep anesthesia until the awake state, MEP amplitude and latency were measured using 5-train electrical bipolar stimulations on the same site of the precentral gyrus each minute during the surgery. The depth of anesthesia was evaluated using the bispectral index (BIS). BIS levels were classified into 7 stages: < 40, and from 40 to 100 in groups of 10 each. MEP amplitude and latency of each stage were compared. The deviation of the MEP measurements, which was defined as a fluctuation from the average in every BIS stage, was also considered. RESULTS A total of 865 MEP waves in 28 cases were evaluated in this study. MEP amplitude was increased and latency was decreased in accordance with the increases in BIS level. The average MEP amplitudes in the > 90 BIS level was approximately 10 times higher than those in the < 40 BIS level. Furthermore, the average MEP latencies in the > 90 BIS level were 1.5-3.1 msec shorter than those in the < 60 BIS level. The deviation of measured MEP amplitudes in the > 90 BIS level was significantly stabilized in comparison with that in the < 60 BIS level. CONCLUSIONS MEP amplitude and latency were closely correlated with depth of anesthesia. In addition, the deviation in MEP amplitude was also correlated with depth of anesthesia, which was smaller during awake surgery (high BIS level) than during deep anesthesia. Therefore, MEP measurement would be more reliable in the awake state than under deep anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26943841/

During the course of the disease, some specific EEG patterns have been described: generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA) and extreme delta brush (EDB). In comatose patients, the association of these EEG abnormalities with subtle motor manifestations can suggest ongoing non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). We report the case of a 28-year-old woman admitted for a clinical presentation typical of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis, which was confirmed by CSF analysis. She was rapidly intubated because of severe dysautonomia and disturbed consciousness. Clinical examination revealed subtle paroxysmal and intermittent myoclonic and tonic movements, correlated on video-EEG with GRDA and/or EDB. NCSE was then suspected, but electroclinical manifestations persisted despite many anti-epileptic drugs combinations, or reappeared when barbiturate anesthesia was decreased. In order to confirm or dismiss the diagnosis, intracranial pressure (ICP) and surface video-EEG monitoring were performed simultaneously and revealed no ICP increase, thus being strongly against a diagnosis of seizures. Sedation was progressively weaned, and clinical condition as well as EEG appearance progressively improved. Literature review revealed 11 similar cases, including 2 with focal NCSE. Of the nine other cases, NCSE diagnosis was finally excluded in 5 cases. NCSE diagnosis in association with anti-NMDA-R encephalitis is sometimes very difficult and its occurrence might be overestimated. Video-EEG is highly recommended and more invasive techniques may sometimes be necessary.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26922283/
26900572,Detectability of the somatosensory evoked high frequency oscillation (HFO) co-recorded by scalp EEG and ECoG under propofol.,NeuroImage. Clinical,2016,"Burnos S, Fedele T, Schmid O, Krayenbühl N, Sarnthein J","The somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) elicited by median nerve stimulation consists of the N20 peak together with the concurrent high frequency oscillation (HFO, > 500 Hz). We describe the conditions for HFO detection in ECoG and scalp EEG in intraoperative recordings.
During neurosurgical interventions in six patients under propofol anesthesia, the SEP was recorded from subdural electrode strips (15 recordings) and from scalp electrodes (10/15 recordings). We quantified the spatial attenuation of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of N20 and HFO along the contacts of the electrode strip. We then compared the SNR of ECoG and simultaneous scalp EEG in a biophysical framework.
HFO detection under propofol anesthesia was demonstrated. Visual inspection of strip cortical recordings revealed phase reversal for N20 in 14/15 recordings and for HFO in 10/15 recordings. N20 had higher maximal SNR (median 33.5 dB) than HFO (median 23 dB). The SNR of N20 attenuated with a larger spatial extent (median 7.2 dB/cm) than the SNR of HFO (median 12.3 dB/cm). We found significant correlations between the maximum SNR (rho = 0.58, p = 0.025) and the spatial attenuation (rho = 0.86, p < 0.001) of N20 and HFO. In 3/10 recordings we found HFO in scalp EEG. Based on the spatial attenuation and SNR in the ECoG, we estimated the scalp EEG amplitude ratio N20/HFO and found significant correlation with recorded values (rho = 0.65, p = 0.049).
We proved possible the intraoperative SEP HFO detection under propofol anesthesia. The spatial attenuation along ECoG contacts represents a good estimator of the area contributing to scalp EEG. The SNR and the spatial attenuation in ECoG recordings provide further insights for the prediction of HFO detectability in scalp EEG. The results obtained in this context may not be limited to SEP HFO, but could be generalized to biological signatures lying in the same SNR and frequency range.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26900572/

EEG-fMRI studies have demonstrated good sensitivity for the localization of epileptic focus but a poor yield although the reasons for this have not been systematically addressed. While adults EEG-fMRI studies are performed in the ""resting state""; children are commonly sedated however, this has associated risks and potential confounds. In this study, we assessed the impact of the following factors on the tolerability and results of EEG-fMRI in children: viewing a movie inside the scanner; movement; occurrence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IED); scan duration and design efficiency. This work's motivation is to optimize EEG-fMRI parameters to make this test widely available to paediatric population.
Forty-six children with focal epilepsy and 20 controls (6-18) underwent EEG-fMRI. For two 10 minutes sessions subjects were told to lie still with eyes closed, as it is classically performed in adult studies (""rest sessions""), for another two sessions, subjects watched a child friendly stimulation i.e. movie (""movie sessions""). IED were mapped with EEG-fMRI for each session and across sessions. The resulting maps were classified as concordant/discordant with the presumed epileptogenic focus for each subject.
Movement increased with scan duration, but the movie reduced movement by ~40% when played within the first 20 minutes. There was no effect of movie on the occurrence of IED, nor in the concordance of the test. Ability of EEG-fMRI to map the epileptogenic region was similar for the 20 and 40 minute scan durations. Design efficiency was predictive of concordance.
A child friendly natural stimulus improves the tolerability of EEG-fMRI and reduces in-scanner movement without having an effect on IED occurrence and quality of EEG-fMRI maps. This allowed us to scan children as young as 6 and obtain localising information without sedation. Our data suggest that ~20 minutes is the optimal length of scanning for EEG-fMRI studies in children with frequent IED. The efficiency of the fMRI design derived from spontaneous IED generation is an important factor for producing concordant results.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26872220/

We theorize that cytokine production produced by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and obstructive sleep apnea may act as stimuli for ongoing CRPS symptoms.

In this cohort study, 4 EEG specialists, blinded to outcome, evaluated prospectively recorded EEGs in the Target Temperature Management trial (TTM trial) that randomized patients to 33°C vs 36°C. Routine EEG was performed in patients still comatose after rewarming. EEGs were classified into highly malignant (suppression, suppression with periodic discharges, burst-suppression), malignant (periodic or rhythmic patterns, pathological or nonreactive background), and benign EEG (absence of malignant features). Poor outcome was defined as best Cerebral Performance Category score 3-5 until 180 days.
Eight TTM sites randomized 202 patients. EEGs were recorded in 103 patients at a median 77 hours after cardiac arrest; 37% had a highly malignant EEG and all had a poor outcome (specificity 100%, sensitivity 50%). Any malignant EEG feature had a low specificity to predict poor prognosis (48%) but if 2 malignant EEG features were present specificity increased to 96% (p < 0.001). Specificity and sensitivity were not significantly affected by targeted temperature or sedation. A benign EEG was found in 1% of the patients with a poor outcome.
Highly malignant EEG after rewarming reliably predicted poor outcome in half of patients without false predictions. An isolated finding of a single malignant feature did not predict poor outcome whereas a benign EEG was highly predictive of a good outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26865516/

Due to neuromuscular blocking agents, patients could be conscious yet unable to move. Using brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, it may be possible to detect movement attempts from the EEG. However, it is unknown how an anesthetic influences the brain response to motor tasks.
We tested the offline classification performance of a movement-based BCI in 12 healthy subjects at two effect-site concentrations of propofol. For each subject a second classifier was trained on the subject's data obtained before sedation, then tested on the data obtained during sedation ('transfer classification').
At concentration 0.5 μg ml(-1), despite an overall propofol EEG effect, the mean single trial classification accuracy was 85% (95% CI 81%-89%), and 83% (79%-88%) for the transfer classification. At 1.0 μg ml(-1), the accuracies were 81% (76%-86%), and 72% (66%-79%), respectively. At the highest propofol concentration for four subjects, unlike the remaining subjects, the movement-related brain response had been largely diminished, and the transfer classification accuracy was not significantly above chance. These subjects showed a slower and more erratic task response, indicating an altered state of consciousness distinct from that of the other subjects.
The results show the potential of using a BCI to detect intra-operative awareness and justify further development of this paradigm. At the same time, the relationship between motor responses and consciousness and its clinical relevance for intraoperative awareness requires further investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26859192/
26844972,Highly Epileptiform Bursts Are Associated With Seizure Recurrence.,Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,2016,"Thompson SA, Hantus S","Pharmacologic sedation is often used to induce burst suppression in cases of refractory status epilepticus, but there is little evidence to guide the weaning of sedation. Similarly, the morphologic feature of bursts is of unknown clinical relevance. Recently, the standardized American Clinical Neurophysiology Society terminology of critical care EEG introduced the term highly epileptiform bursts (HEBs). Knowing the association of HEBs with seizure may direct the therapy for refractory status epilepticus.
Consecutive adult patients classified as having burst suppression were identified in our EEG database. Those of an anoxic etiology were excluded. Available EEG records were reviewed, both visually and quantitatively, for the presence of burst suppression. Using the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society terminology, burst suppression was dichotomized into HEBs or nonepileptiform bursts. Periods of transition out of burst suppression were identified, and whether burst suppression was followed by seizure or a continuous slow EEG within 24 hours was determined.
Twenty-four patients were identified with a burst suppression pattern followed by either seizure or a continuous slow EEG within 24 hours, with some patients having multiple (maximal 5) transitions out of burst suppression, for a total of 33 examples of burst suppression. HEBs were associated with subsequent seizure (P = 0.0001), independent of medication exposure.
Whether or not HEBs are indeed predictive of recurrent seizure or may be used to direct the therapy for status epilepticus, specifically the weaning of anesthetic medications, requires further prospective study in a larger cohort of patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26844972/

The combination of TAES and anesthesia has been proved valid in enhancing the anesthetic effects but its mechanisms are still not clear.
In this study, we investigated the effect of TAES on anesthesia with an electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillation analysis on surgery patients anesthetized with propofol, a widely-used anesthetic in clinical practice. EEG was continuously recorded during light and deep propofol sedation (target-controlled infusion set at 1.0 and 3.0 μg/mL) in ten surgery patients with pituitary tumor excision. Each concentration of propofol was maintained for 6 min and TAES was given at 2-4 min. The changes in EEG power spectrum at different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) and the coherence of different EEG channels were analyzed.
Our result showed that, after TAES application, the EEG power increased at alpha and beta bands in light sedation of propofol, but reduced at delta and beta bands in deep propofol sedation (p < 0.001). In addition, the EEG oscillation analysis showed an enhancement of synchronization at low frequencies and a decline in synchronization at high frequencies between different EEG channels in either light or deep propofol sedation.
Our study showed evidence suggested that TAES may have different effects on propofol under light and deep sedation. TAES could enhance the sedative effect of propofol at low concentration but reduce the sedative effect of propofol at high concentration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26817460/

The intranasal (IN) route avoids the pain of intravenous (i.v.) catheter placement but limited literature exists on the use of IN dexmedetomidine. This study examines the effectiveness and safety of IN dexmedetomidine for sedation of patients undergoing electroencephalogram (EEG) and auditory brain response (ABR) testing.
This was a review of all outpatients sedated with IN dexmedetomidine for EEG or ABR between October 1, 2012 and October 1, 2014. An initial dose of 2.5-3 μg · kg(-1) IN dexmedetomidine was given with a repeat dose of 1-1.5 μg · kg(-1) IN if needed 30 min later. Prospectively entered patient information was extracted from a quality assurance database and additional information gathered via retrospective chart review.
Intranasal dexmedetomidine was used in 169 patients (EEG = 117, ABR = 52). First-dose success rates were 90.4% for ABR and 87.2% for EEG. Total success rates (with one or two doses of IN dexmedetomidine) were 100% for ABR and 99.1% for EEG. The median time to onset of sleep was 25 min (IQR, 20-32 min). The median duration of sedation was 107 min (IQR, 90-131 min). Adverse events included: 18 patients (10.7%) with hypotension which resolved without intervention, six patients with oxygen desaturation <90%, two of whom received supplemental oxygen, and one patient with an underlying upper airway abnormality who was treated with continuous positive airway pressure.
IN dexmedetomidine is an effective and noninvasive method of sedating children for EEG and ABR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26814037/

All children given iv LCM were identified from 2009 to 2015. Records were audited for demographics, seizure classification, etiology, EEG, imaging, indication. Baseline seizure frequency was based on parental reporting, continuous video EEG and direct observation.
47 patients were identified with median age 6.5 years, 18 less than 3 years old, including 8 younger than 12 months. LCM was an adjunctive therapy of ≥2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). LCM was administered intravenously to treat epilepsia partialis continua (n = 3, dose range 5-10 mg/kg), status epilepticus (n = 11, median dose 7.2 mg/kg, range 4-11 mg/kg), and acute exacerbation of seizure frequency (n = 18, median dose 4.5 mg/kg, range 1-11 mg/kg). Parenteral form was substituted for oral form for 10 children treated with maintenance LCM unable to ingest/tolerate enteral medication and 5 who were given iv LCM to initiate maintenance treatment (median dose 4 mg/kg, range: 2-10 mg/kg).

Electronic medical records and the intraoperative EEGs of 32 patients who underwent aortic arch reconstruction with DHCA were reviewed. Preoperative patient characteristics, intraoperative data, and postoperative outcomes were examined. EEGs were graded based on the frequency of sharp transients (grade 0-2) and/or the presence of rhythmic electrographic discharges (grade 3).
Periodic sharp transients were seen in 30/32 cases. Grade 1 and grade 2 activations were more prominent during cooling at nasopharyngeal temperature of 23.9±4.01 °C (mean±SDV). Rhythmic electrographic discharges occurred in seven patients and were exclusively seen during cooling at nasopharyngeal temperatures below 28 °C except in one case during rewarming at nasopharyngeal temperatures of 22°C. No patient with rhythmic discharges developed postoperative clinical neurologic deficit or seizures.
Periodic sharp transients occurred in almost all cases during induction of deep hypothermia. This activity was not associated with postoperative neurologic deficit.

Chloral hydrate (CH) requires medical clearance and continuous monitoring. To try to reduce personnel and time resources associated with CH administration, a new sedation policy was formulated. This study included all children who underwent an EEG during a consecutive 3-month period following the implementation of the new sedation policy, which consists of the sequential administration of melatonin, hydroxyzine (if needed), and CH (if needed). The comparator group included all children with a recorded EEG during a consecutive 3-month period when the sedation policy consisted of the sole administration of CH. A total of 803 children with a mean age of 7.9 years (SD = 5.1, range = 0.5-17.7 years) were included. Sleep EEG recordings were obtained in 364 of 385 children (94.6%) using the old sedation policy and in 409 of 418 children (97.9%) using the new one. With the new sedation policy, the percentage of children requiring CH dropped from 37.1% to 6.7% (P < .001). Time to sleep onset and duration of sleep were not significantly different between the 2 policies. The new sedation policy was very well tolerated.

However, subjects can become disconnected from the environment while still having conscious experiences, as demonstrated by sleep states associated with dreaming. Among anesthetics, ketamine is remarkable in that it induces profound unresponsiveness, but subjects often report ""ketamine dreams"" upon emergence from anesthesia. Here, we aimed at assessing consciousness during anesthesia with propofol, xenon, and ketamine, independent of behavioral responsiveness. To do so, in 18 healthy volunteers, we measured the complexity of the cortical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)--an approach that has proven helpful in assessing objectively the level of consciousness irrespective of sensory processing and motor responses. In addition, upon emergence from anesthesia, we collected reports about conscious experiences during unresponsiveness. Both frontal and parietal TMS elicited a low-amplitude electroencephalographic (EEG) slow wave corresponding to a local pattern of cortical activation with low complexity during propofol anesthesia, a high-amplitude EEG slow wave corresponding to a global, stereotypical pattern of cortical activation with low complexity during xenon anesthesia, and a wakefulness-like, complex spatiotemporal activation pattern during ketamine anesthesia. Crucially, participants reported no conscious experience after emergence from propofol and xenon anesthesia, whereas after ketamine they reported long, vivid dreams unrelated to the external environment. These results are relevant because they suggest that brain complexity may be sensitive to the presence of disconnected consciousness in subjects who are considered unconscious based on behavioral responses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26752078/

Annual International Conference,2015,"Zhou DW, Westover MB, McClain LM, Nagaraj SB, Bajwa EK, Quraishi SA, Akeju O, Cobb JP, Purdon PL","Millions of patients are admitted each year to intensive care units (ICUs) in the United States. A significant fraction of ICU survivors develop life-long cognitive impairment, incurring tremendous financial and societal costs. Delirium, a state of impaired awareness, attention and cognition that frequently develops during ICU care, is a major risk factor for post-ICU cognitive impairment. Recent studies suggest that patients experiencing electroencephalogram (EEG) burst suppression have higher rates of mortality and are more likely to develop delirium than patients who do not experience burst suppression. Burst suppression is typically associated with coma and deep levels of anesthesia or hypothermia, and is defined clinically as an alternating pattern of high-amplitude ""burst"" periods interrupted by sustained low-amplitude ""suppression"" periods. Here we describe a clustering method to analyze EEG spectra during burst and suppression periods. We used this method to identify a set of distinct spectral patterns in the EEG during burst and suppression periods in critically ill patients. These patterns correlate with level of patient sedation, quantified in terms of sedative infusion rates and clinical sedation scores. This analysis suggests that EEG burst suppression in critically ill patients may not be a single state, but instead may reflect a plurality of states whose specific dynamics relate to a patient's underlying brain function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26737967/

The aim of this study was to set up a combined model to relate actual drug levels to EEG dynamics and behavioral states during propofol-induced anesthesia. We proposed a new combined theoretical model based on a pharmacokinetics (PK) model and a neural mass model (NMM), which we termed PK-NMM--with the aim of simulating electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during propofol-induced general anesthesia. The PK model was used to derive propofol effect-site drug concentrations (C(eff)) based on the actual drug infusion regimen. The NMM model took C(eff) as the control parameter to produce simulated EEG-like (sEEG) data. For comparison, we used real prefrontal EEG (rEEG) data of nine volunteers undergoing propofol anesthesia from a previous experiment. To see how well the sEEG could describe the dynamic changes of neural activity during anesthesia, the rEEG data and the sEEG data were compared with respect to: power-frequency plots; nonlinear exponent (permutation entropy (PE)); and bispectral SynchFastSlow (SFS) parameters. We found that the PK-NMM model was able to reproduce anesthesia EEG-like signals based on the estimated drug concentration and patients' condition. The frequency spectrum indicated that the frequency power peak of the sEEG moved towards the low frequency band as anesthesia deepened. Different anesthetic states could be differentiated by the PE index. The correlation coefficient of PE was 0.80 ± 0.13 (mean ± standard deviation) between rEEG and sEEG for all subjects. Additionally, SFS could track the depth of anesthesia and the SFS of rEEG and sEEG were highly correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.77 ± 0.13. The PK-NMM model could simulate EEG activity and might be a useful tool for understanding the action of propofol on brain activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26720495/

We assessed whether the addition of xenon gas, a promising novel therapy, after the initiation of hypothermia for birth asphyxia would result in further improvement.
Total Body hypothermia plus Xenon (TOBY-Xe) was a proof-of-concept, randomised, open-label, parallel-group trial done at four intensive-care neonatal units in the UK. Eligible infants were 36-43 weeks of gestational age, had signs of moderate to severe encephalopathy and moderately or severely abnormal background activity for at least 30 min or seizures as shown by amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), and had one of the following: Apgar score of 5 or less 10 min after birth, continued need for resuscitation 10 min after birth, or acidosis within 1 h of birth. Participants were allocated in a 1:1 ratio by use of a secure web-based computer-generated randomisation sequence within 12 h of birth to cooling to a rectal temperature of 33·5°C for 72 h (standard treatment) or to cooling in combination with 30% inhaled xenon for 24 h started immediately after randomisation. The primary outcomes were reduction in lactate to N-acetyl aspartate ratio in the thalamus and in preserved fractional anisotropy in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy and MRI, respectively, within 15 days of birth. The investigator assessing these outcomes was masked to allocation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00934700, and with ISRCTN, as ISRCTN08886155.
The study was done from Jan 31, 2012, to Sept 30, 2014. We enrolled 92 infants, 46 of whom were randomly assigned to cooling only and 46 to xenon plus cooling. 37 infants in the cooling only group and 41 in the cooling plus xenon group underwent magnetic resonance assessments and were included in the analysis of the primary outcomes. We noted no significant differences in lactate to N-acetyl aspartate ratio in the thalamus (geometric mean ratio 1·09, 95% CI 0·90 to 1·32) or fractional anisotropy (mean difference -0·01, 95% CI -0·03 to 0·02) in the posterior limb of the internal capsule between the two groups. Nine infants died in the cooling group and 11 in the xenon group. Two adverse events were reported in the xenon group: subcutaneous fat necrosis and transient desaturation during the MRI. No serious adverse events were recorded.
Administration of xenon within the delayed timeframe used in this trial is feasible and apparently safe, but is unlikely to enhance the neuroprotective effect of cooling after birth asphyxia.

We hypothesized that intraoperative EEG activity may provide insight into future neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Neonates requiring surgery had continuous intraoperative EEG and hemodynamic monitoring. The level of EEG suppression was classified as either: slow and continuous; moderate burst suppression; severe burst suppression; or isoelectric (no brain activity for >3 minutes). Follow-up neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale II (Vineland-II).
Twenty-one neonates requiring cardiac surgery developed a slow and continuous EEG pattern after general anesthesia. Ten neonates (48%) maintained continuous brain electrical activity with moderate burst suppression as the maximum level of EEG suppression. Eleven neonates (52%) developed severe burst suppression that progressed into an isoelectric state during the deep hypothermic period required for circulatory arrest. However, the duration of this state was significantly longer than circulatory arrest times (111.1 ± 50 vs 22.3 ± 17 minutes; P < .001). At a mean follow-up at 5.6 ± 1.0 years, compared with neonates with continuous brain electrical activity, neonates who developed an isoelectric state had lower Vineland-II scores in communication. There was an inverse relationship between composite Vineland-II scores and duration of isoelectric activity (R = -0.75, P = .01). Of neonates who experienced an isoelectric state, durations of >90 minutes were associated with the lowest Vineland-II scores (125.0 ± 2.6 vs 81.1 ± 12.7; P < .01).
The duration of cortical isoelectric states seems related to neurodevelopmental outcomes. Strategies using continuous EEG monitoring to minimize isoelectric states may be useful during complex congenital heart surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26707762/

When measured from conventional EEG recordings, the binary burst-suppression signal (BS) appears similar across the scalp. As such, the BS ratio (BSR), quantifying the fraction of time spent in suppression, is clinically considered a global index of brain function in sedation monitoring. Recent studies indicate that BS may be considerably asynchronous when measured with higher spatial resolution such as on electrocorticography. The authors investigated the magnitude of BSR changes with cortical recording interelectrode distance.
The authors selected fronto-parietal electrocorticography recordings showing propofol-induced BS recorded via 8-electrode strips (1-cm interelectrode distance) during cortical motor mapping in 31 patients. For 1-minute epochs, bipolar recordings were computed between each electrode pair. The median BSR, burst duration (BD), and bursting frequency were derived for each interelectrode distance.
At 1-cm interelectrode distance, with increasing BSR, BD decreased exponentially. For a BSR between 50% and 80%, BD reached a plateau of 2.1 seconds while the bursting frequency decreased from 14 to 6 bursts per minute. With increasing interelectrode distance, BD increased at a rate of 0.2 seconds per cm. This correlated with a decrease in BSR with distance that reached the rate of -4.4 percentage per centimeters during deepest anesthesia.
With increasing cortical interelectrode recording distance, burst summation leads to an increasing BD associated with a reduction in BSR. Standardization of interelectrode distance is important for cortical BSR measurements.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26690549/

26621628,Can Intraoperative Processed EEG Predict Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction in the Elderly?,Clinical therapeutics,2015,"Deiner S, Luo X, Silverstein JH, Sano M","Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious and costly complication of the elderly; even mild impairment has the potential to impact overall well being. Anesthesiologists continue to search for ways to manipulate intraoperative technique to optimize postoperative cognition in the elderly. Depth of anesthesia during surgery is an area that has shown some promise for short-term outcomes, such as delirium. However, excessive depth has both positive and negative associations with longer-term POCD. We hypothesize that this uncertainty is due to the inability of median depth to capture the amount of burst suppression or electrical silence. In this study, our purpose was to identify the intraoperative processed EEG parameters that are most closely correlated with POCD.
To explore the association of several processed EEG parameters with POCD, we performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 105 patients aged >68 years scheduled for major surgery under general anesthesia. Intraoperative medications, hemodynamics, processed EEG and cerebral oxygen saturation were recorded. All patients had a cognitive battery before surgery and repeated at 3 months afterward.
One hundred and five patients enrolled and 77 (73.3%) patients completed the 3-month cognitive testing. The incidence of POCD was 27%; the median Bispectral Index value for patients who developed POCD was similar to patients who did not (46 vs 42 minutes). However, patients who developed POCD spent less time with Bispectral Index <45 minutes (82.8 vs 122.5 minutes, P = 0.01) and burst suppression (35 vs 96 minutes, P = 0.04). Hypotension, cerebral desaturation, and use of total intravenous anesthesia were similar between patients with and without POCD.
Patients who developed POCD spent less time in EEG burst suppression and less time in deep states. Burst suppression may be protective for POCD. Further work is needed to definitively identify the role of burst suppression in the context of other patient and intraoperative variables to prevent POCD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26621628/

Clinical, electroencephalography and neuroimaging findings were analyzed. Moreover, all parameters from the b-BIS data including the CDSA were reviewed during periods of NCSE (NCSE pattern) and profound sedation (sedation pattern).
15 NCSE patients were included. The delay from the diagnosis of NCSE to the onset of b-BIS monitoring was 8 (0.5-31)h and total time of b-BIS monitoring 7.8±6.5 days. CDSA during NCSE pattern was characterized by continuous or intermittent red and dark red tones, spectral edge frequency (SEF) in the delta-theta range, with or without asymmetry and BIS number trend with significant variability. In contrast, CDSA during sedation revealed predominance of orange, yellow, green and occasionally blue tones, SEF in the alpha-beta range, absence of asymmetry and stability of BIS number.

We generated animation movies showing electrocorticography (ECoG) amplitudes at eight spectral frequency bands across 1.0-116 Hz, every 0.1s, on three-dimensional surface images of 10 children who underwent epilepsy surgery. We measured the onset, intensity, and variance of each band amplitude change at given nonepileptic regions separately from those at affected regions. We also determined the presence of differential ECoG changes depending on the brain anatomy.
Within 20s following injection of midazolam, beta (16-31.5 Hz) and sigma (12-15.5 Hz) activities began to be multifocally augmented with increased variance in amplitude at each site. Beta-sigma augmentation was most prominent within the association neocortex. Augmentation of low-delta activity (1.0-1.5 Hz) was relatively modest and confined to the somatosensory-motor region. Conversely, injection of midazolam induced attenuation of theta (4.0-7.5 Hz) and high-gamma (64-116 Hz) activities.
Our observations support the notion that augmentation beta-sigma and delta activities reflects cortical deactivation or inactivation, whereas theta and high-gamma activities contribute to maintenance of consciousness. The effects of midazolam on the dynamics of cortical oscillations differed across regions.

We investigated whether during anaesthesia premature-born children display different patterns of background EEG activity and exhibit increased responses to nociceptive stimuli.
We examined background EEG and time-locked responses to clinical cannulation in 45 children (mean age (±SD) at study: 4.9(±3.0)years) under sevoflurane monoanaesthesia maintained at a steady-state end-tidal concentration of 2.5%. 15 were born prematurely (mean gestational age at birth: 29.2 ± 3.9 weeks) and 30 were age-matched term-born children.
Background levels of alpha and beta power were significantly lower in the premature-born children compared to term-born controls (p=0.048). Clinical cannulation evoked a significant increase in delta activity (p=0.032), which was not significantly different between the two groups (p=0.44).
The results indicate that whilst under anaesthesia premature-born children display different patterns of background brain activity compared to term-born children.
As electrophysiological techniques are increasingly used by anaesthetists to gauge anaesthetic depth, differences in background levels of electrophysiological brain activity between premature and term-born children may be relevant when considering titration of anaesthetic dose.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26589678/

The current case report describes a 23-year-old man admitted for elective surgery who experienced several seizure-like episodes after induction with propofol and during a desflurane-based general anesthetic that were so severe it was not possible to complete the procedure. A second surgery was rescheduled 2 days later with simultaneous scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recording and general anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl. During the second operation, he again experienced numerous episodes of generalized shaking movements. Simultaneous intraoperative EEG recording showed a background of diffuse beta and alpha frequencies interspersed with periods of pseudoperiodic delta activity; electrographic seizures were not apparent. With this information, muscle relaxants were given and the procedure was performed without difficulty. This is the first report of apparent seizure-like activity during anesthesia with propofol of an otherwise relatively healthy adult, in which concurrent EEG recording demonstrates the nonepileptic nature. The current case demonstrates that, at least in some instances, these concerning movements are not seizure related. Concurrent EEG monitoring may be helpful to evaluate the nature of the episodes in select cases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26588032/

Polysomnography (PSG) is considered the gold standard test to monitor sleep objectively, but some practical and technical constraints exist due to environmental and patient considerations. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is commonly used in clinical practice for guiding anesthetic administration and provides an index based on relationships between EEG components. Due to similarities in EEG synchronization between anesthesia and sleep, several studies have assessed BIS as a sleep monitor with contradictory results. The aim of this study was to evaluate objectively both the feasibility and reliability of BIS for sleep monitoring through a robust methodology, which included full PSG recordings at a baseline situation and after 40 h of sleep deprivation. Results confirmed that the BIS index was highly correlated with the hypnogram (0.89 ± 0.02), showing a progressive decrease as sleep deepened, and an increase during REM sleep (awake: 91.77 ± 8.42; stage N1: 83.95 ± 11.05; stage N2: 71.71 ± 11.99; stage N3: 42.41 ± 9.14; REM: 80.11 ± 8.73). Mean and median BIS values were lower in the post-deprivation night than in the baseline night, showing statistical differences for the slow wave sleep (baseline: 42.41 ± 9.14 vs. post-deprivation: 39.49 ± 10.27; p = 0.02). BIS scores were able to discriminate properly between deep (N3) and light (N1, N2) sleep. BIS values during REM overlapped those of other sleep stages, although EMG activity provided by the BIS monitor could help to identify REM sleep if needed. In conclusion, BIS monitors could provide a useful measure of sleep depth in especially particular situations such as intensive care units, and they could be used as an alternative for sleep monitoring in order to reduce PSG-derived costs and to increase capacity in ambulatory care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26578097/

Vital signals contain valuable information that can be used in prediction of different levels of anesthesia. Some monitors based on electroencephalogram (EEG) such as the Bispectral (BIS) index have been proposed in recent years. This study proposes a new method for characterizing between awake and anesthetized states. We validated our method by obtaining data from 25 patients during the cardiac surgery that requires cardiopulmonary bypass. At first, some linear and non-linear features are extracted from EEG signals. Then a method called ""LLE""(Locally Linear Embedding) is used to map high-dimensional features in a three-dimensional output space. Finally, low dimensional data are used as an input to a quadratic discriminant analyzer (QDA). The experimental results indicate that an overall accuracy of 88.4 % can be obtained using this method for classifying the EEG signal into conscious and unconscious states for all patients. Considering the reliability of this method, we can develop a new EEG monitoring system that could assist the anesthesiologists to estimate the depth of anesthesia accurately.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26573650/

The main aim of the present study was to examine the accuracy of middle-latency SSEP triggered by a painful electrical stimulation on median nerves to predict a favorable outcome.
No- and low-flow times, pupillary reflex, Glasgow motor score and biochemical data were evaluated at ICU admission. The following were considered within 72 h of cardiac arrest: highest creatinine value, hyperthermia occurrence, EEG, SSEP at low- (10 mA) and high-intensity (50 mA) stimulation, and blood pressure reactivity to 50 mA. Intensive care treatments were also considered. Data were compared to survival, consciousness recovery and 6-month CPC (Cerebral Performance Category).
Pupillary reflex and EEG were statistically significant in predicting survival; the absence of blood pressure reactivity seems to predict brain death within 7 days of cardiac arrest. Middle- and short-latency SSEP were statistically significant in predicting consciousness recovery, and middle-latency SSEP was statistically significant in predicting 6-month CPC outcome. The prognostic capability of 50 mA middle-latency-SSEP was demonstrated to occur earlier than that of EEG reactivity.
Neurophysiological evaluation constitutes the key to early information about the neurological prognostication of postanoxic coma. In particular, the presence of 50 mA middle-latency SSEP seems to be an early and reliable predictor of good neurological outcome, and its absence constitutes a marker of poor prognosis. Moreover, the absence 50 mA blood pressure reactivity seems to identify patients evolving towards the brain death.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26573633/

Totally 63-patient data is addressed, for both modeling and testing of 17 and 46 patients, respectively. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is utilized to purify between the electroencephalography (EEG) signal and the noise. The filtered EEG signal is subsequently extracted to achieve a sample entropy index by every 5-second signal. Then, it is combined with other mean values of vital signs, that is, electromyography (EMG), heart rate (HR), pulse, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and signal quality index (SQI) to evaluate the DoA index as the input. The 5 doctor scores are averaged to obtain an output index. The mean absolute error (MAE) is utilized as the performance evaluation. 10-fold cross-validation is performed in order to generalize the model. The ANN model is compared with the bispectral index (BIS). The results show that the ANN is able to produce lower MAE than BIS. For the correlation coefficient, ANN also has higher value than BIS tested on the 46-patient testing data. Sensitivity analysis and cross-validation method are applied in advance.

The effects of an ipsilateral injection of etomidate on the functional properties of contralateral hemisphere are not known. Our aim was to characterize the electroencephalographic (EEG) effects after intracarotid injection of etomidate and to determine the changes in synchronization between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres.
We retrospectively analyzed EEG data from 15 patients who underwent Wada test with etomidate. Continuous EEG data from 4 electrodes (2 anterior [F3, F4] and 2 posterior [P3, P4]) were analyzed. After artifact rejection, we measured the amplitudes of delta (1 to 4 Hz) and alpha (7 to 13 Hz) waves and the changes in the interhemispheric synchronization before, during, and after etomidate injection.
Ipsilateral injection of etomidate causes EEG changes in both hemispheres with increased amplitude of delta waves anteriorly and the alpha waves posteriorly. However this effect of etomidate is not uniform. Although there was a decrease in the interhemispheric synchronization of delta waves, there was no change in the synchronization of the alpha waves.
Our study showed that the EEG effects of intracarotid ipsilateral injection of etomidate is not uniform in both hemispheres. Decrease in the interhemispheric synchronization of delta waves might serve as an indicator of ipsilateral effect of etomidate on the brain. Additional studies are needed to confirm our findings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26536542/
26505573,Comparisons of Electroencephalographically Derived Measures of Hypnosis and Antinociception in Response to Standardized Stimuli During Target-Controlled Propofol-Remifentanil Anesthesia.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2016,"Shoushtarian M, Sahinovic MM, Absalom AR, Kalmar AF, Vereecke HE, Liley DT, Struys MM","Current electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived measures provide information on cortical activity and hypnosis but are less accurate regarding subcortical activity, which is expected to vary with the degree of antinociception. Recently, the neurophysiologically based EEG measures of cortical input (CI) and cortical state (CS) have been shown to be prospective indicators of analgesia/antinociception and hypnosis, respectively. In this study, we compared CI and an alternate measure of CS, the composite cortical state (CCS), with the Bispectral Index (BIS) and another recently developed measure of antinociception, the composite variability index (CVI). CVI is an EEG-derived measure based on a weighted combination of BIS and estimated electromyographic activity. By assessing the relationship between these indices for equivalent levels of hypnosis (as quantified using the BIS) and the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance (as determined by the predicted effect-site concentration of remifentanil), we sought to evaluate whether combining hypnotic and analgesic measures could better predict movement in response to a noxious stimulus than when used alone.
Time series of BIS and CVI indices and the raw EEG from a previously published study were reanalyzed. In our current study, the data from 80 patients, each randomly allocated to a target hypnotic level (BIS 50 or BIS 70) and a target remifentanil level (Remi-0, -2, -4 or -6 ng/mL), were included in the analysis. CCS, CI, BIS, and CVI were calculated or quantified at baseline and at a number of intervals after the application of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale and a subsequent tetanic stimulus. The dependency of the putative measures of antinociception CI and CVI on effect-site concentration of remifentanil was then quantified, together with their relationship to the hypnotic measures CCS and BIS. Finally, statistical clustering methods were used to evaluate the extent to which simple combinations of antinociceptive and hypnotic measures could better detect and predict response to stimulation.
Before stimulation, both CI and CVI differentiated patients who received remifentanil from those who were randomly allocated to the Remi-0 group (CI: Cohen's d = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.83; CVI: Cohen's d = 0.72, 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.88). Strong correlations between BIS and CCS were found (at different periods: 0.55 < R2 < 0.68, P < 0.001). Application of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation stimulus was associated with changes in CI and CCS, whereas, subsequent to the application of both stimuli, changes in all measures were seen. Pairwise combinations of CI and CCS showed higher sensitivity in detecting response to stimulation than CVI and BIS combined (sensitivity [99% confidence interval], 75.8% [52.7%-98.8%] vs 42% [15.4%-68.5%], P = 0.006), with specificity for CI and CCS approaching significance (52% [34.7%-69.3%] vs 24% [9.1%-38.9%], P = 0.0159).
Combining electroencephalographically derived hypnotic and analgesic quantifiers may enable better prediction of patients who are likely to respond to tetanic stimulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26505573/

However, SampEn only estimates the complexity of signals on one time scale. In this study, a new approach is introduced using multiscale entropy (MSE) considering the structure information over different time scales. The entropy values over different time scales calculated through MSE are applied as the input data to train an artificial neural network (ANN) model using bispectral index (BIS) or expert assessment of conscious level (EACL) as the target. To test the performance of the new index's sensitivity to artifacts, we compared the results before and after filtration by multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). The new approach via ANN is utilized in real EEG signals collected from 26 patients before and after filtering by MEMD, respectively; the results show that is a higher correlation between index from the proposed approach and the gold standard compared with SampEn. Moreover, the proposed approach is more structurally robust to noise and artifacts which indicates that it can be used for monitoring the DOA more accurately.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26491464/

The syndrome characterised by psychosis, seizures, sleep disorders, hallucinations and short-term memory loss. Ovarian teratoma is the confirmed tumour associated with anti-NMDAR antibodies. The patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis complicated by ovarian teratoma require surgical treatment under general anesthesia. NMDARs are important targets of many anesthetic drugs. The perioperative management and complications of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, including hypoventilation, paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) and epilepsy, are challenging for ansthesiologists.

Two patients received gamma globulin treatments and the resection of the ovarian teratoma under total intravenous anesthesia. They were recovered and discharged on the 20(th) and 46(th) postoperative day respectively.
There is insufficient evidence about the perioperative management, monitoring and anesthesia management of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. This report was based on the consideration that controversial anesthetics that likely act on NMDARs should be avoided.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities occurring at the acute stage of sepsis may correlate with severity of brain dysfunction. Predictive value of early standard EEG abnormalities for mortality in ICU septic patients remains to be assessed.
In this prospective, single center, observational study, standard EEG was performed, analyzed and classified according to both Synek and Young EEG scales, in consecutive patients acutely admitted in ICU for sepsis. Delirium, coma and the level of sedation were assessed at the time of EEG recording; and duration of sedation, occurrence of in-ICU delirium or death were assessed during follow-up. Adjusted analyses were carried out using multiple logistic regression.
One hundred ten patients were included, mean age 63.8 (±18.1) years, median SAPS-II score 38 (29-55). At the time of EEG recording, 46 patients (42%) were sedated and 22 (20%) suffered from delirium. Overall, 54 patients (49%) developed delirium, of which 32 (29%) in the days after EEG recording. 23 (21%) patients died in the ICU. Absence of EEG reactivity was observed in 27 patients (25%), periodic discharges (PDs) in 21 (19%) and electrographic seizures (ESZ) in 17 (15%). ICU mortality was independently associated with a delta-predominant background (OR: 3.36; 95% CI [1.08 to 10.4]), absence of EEG reactivity (OR: 4.44; 95% CI [1.37-14.3], PDs (OR: 3.24; 95% CI [1.03 to 10.2]), Synek grade ≥ 3 (OR: 5.35; 95% CI [1.66-17.2]) and Young grade > 1 (OR: 3.44; 95% CI [1.09-10.8]) after adjustment to Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS-II) at admission and level of sedation. Delirium at the time of EEG was associated with ESZ in non-sedated patients (32% vs 10%, p = 0.037); with Synek grade ≥ 3 (36% vs 7%, p< 0.05) and Young grade > 1 (36% vs 17%, p< 0.001).

Intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) slowing has been associated previously with postoperative delirium, but the relationship between intraoperative EEG suppression and postoperative delirium has not been investigated.
In this observational cohort study, 727 adult patients who received general anesthesia with planned intensive care unit admission were included. Duration of intraoperative EEG suppression was recorded from a frontal EEG channel (FP1 to F7). Delirium was assessed twice daily on postoperative days 1 through 5 with the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit. Thirty days after surgery, quality of life, functional independence, and cognitive ability were measured using the Veterans RAND 12-item survey, the Barthel index, and the PROMIS Applied Cognition-Abilities-Short Form 4a survey.
Postoperative delirium was observed in 162 (26%) of 619 patients assessed. When we compared patients with no EEG suppression with those divided into quartiles based on duration of EEG suppression, patients with more suppression were more likely to experience delirium (χ(4) = 25, P < 0.0001). This effect remained significant after we adjusted for potential confounders (odds ratio for log(EEG suppression) 1.22 [99% confidence interval, 1.06-1.40, P = 0.0002] per 1-minute increase in suppression). EEG suppression may have been associated with reduced functional independence (Spearman partial correlation coefficient -0.15, P = 0.02) but not with changes in quality of life or cognitive ability. Predictors of EEG suppression included greater end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentration and lower intraoperative opioid dose.
EEG suppression is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium. Future studies should investigate whether anesthesia titration to minimize EEG suppression decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium.

Clinical data demonstrate a 30-35% lifetime prevalence of depression in patients with epilepsy, and patients diagnosed with depression have a three to sevenfold higher risk of developing epilepsy. Traditional epilepsy models partially replicate the clinical observations, with the demonstration of depressive traits in epileptic animals. Studies assessing pro-epileptogenic changes in models of depression, however, are more limited. Here, we examined whether a traditional rodent depression model--bilateral olfactory bulbectomy--predisposes the animals towards the development of epilepsy. Past studies have demonstrated increased neuronal excitability after bulbectomy, but continuous seizure monitoring had not been conducted. For the present study, we monitored control and bulbectomized animals by video-EEG 24/7 for approximately two weeks following the surgery to determine whether they develop spontaneous seizures. All seven bulbectomized mice exhibited seizures during the monitoring period. Seizures began about one week after surgery, and occurred in clusters with severity increasing over the monitoring period. These results suggest that olfactory bulbectomy could be a useful model of TBI-induced epilepsy, with advantages of relatively rapid seizure onset and a high number of individuals developing the disease. The model may also be useful for investigating the mechanisms underlying the bidirectional relationship between epilepsy and depression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26368332/

It is known to increase the patient satisfaction and improve throughput. However, there are concerns among the clinicians with regard to the depth of sedation, as a deeper degree of sedation is known to increase the incidence of aspiration and other adverse events. So we planned to compare the depth of sedation between propofol and non-propofol based sedation in patients undergoing outpatient colonoscopy, as measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG) based monitor SEDLine monitor (SedlineInc., San Diego, CA). The non-randomized prospective observational study was performed in the outpatient gastroenterology suite of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. Patients included ASA class I-III aged more than 18 years scheduled for colonoscopy under Propofol or non-propofol based sedation. After an institutional review board approval, a written consent was obtained from prospective patients. Sedation (propofol or non-propofol based) was administered by either a certified nurse anesthetist under the supervision of an anesthesiologist (propofol) or a registered endoscopy nurse under the guidance of the endoscopist performing the procedure (non-propofol sedation). Depth of sedation was measured with an EEG based SEDLine monitor. The sedation providers were blinded to the patient state index-the indicator of depth of sedation. PSI (patient state index-SEDLine reading) was documented at colonoscope insertion, removal and at the return of verbal responsiveness after colonoscope withdrawal. Sedation spectrum was retrieved from the data stored on the SEDLine monitor. Patients sedated with propofol experience significantly deeper degrees of sedation at all times during the procedure. Additionally, during significant part of the procedure, they are at PSI levels associated with deep general anesthesia. The group that received propofol was more deeply sedated and had lower PSI values. Lighter propofol titration protocols may lead to improved patient care such as lowering risk of aspiration and hypotension. The role of processed EEG monitors such as the SEDLine monitor to improve sedation protocols remains to be determined. Trial registration We obtained an ethical clearance from the Institute.

Different synchronization measures have their own properties to reflect the changes of EEG activities during different anesthetic states. However, the performance characteristics and the relations of different synchronization measures in evaluating synchronization changes during propofol-induced anesthesia are not fully elucidated. Two-channel EEG data from seven volunteers who had undergone a brief standardized propofol anesthesia were then adopted to calculate eight synchronization indexes. We computed the prediction probability (P K ) of synchronization indexes with Bispectral Index (BIS) and propofol effect-site concentration (C eff ) to quantify the ability of the indexes to predict BIS and C eff . Also, box plots and coefficient of variation were used to reflect the different synchronization changes and their robustness to noise in awake, unconscious and recovery states, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was used for assessing the relationship among synchronization measures, BIS and C eff . Permutation cross mutual information (PCMI) and determinism (DET) could predict BIS and follow C eff better than nonlinear interdependence (NI), mutual information based on kernel estimation (KerMI) and cross correlation. Wavelet transform coherence (WTC) in α and β frequency bands followed BIS and C eff better than that in other frequency bands. There was a significant decrease in unconscious state and a significant increase in recovery state for PCMI and NI, while the trends were opposite for KerMI, DET and WTC. Phase synchronization based on phase locking value (PSPLV) in δ, θ, α and γ1 frequency bands dropped significantly in unconscious state, whereas it had no significant synchronization in recovery state. Moreover, PCMI, NI, DET correlated closely with each other and they had a better robustness to noise and higher correlation with BIS and C eff than other synchronization indexes. Propofol caused EEG synchronization changes during the anesthetic period. Different synchronization measures had individual properties in evaluating synchronization changes in different anesthetic states, which might be related to various forms of neural activities and neurophysiological mechanisms under general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26350675/
26350398,Estimating Directed Connectivity from Cortical Recordings and Reconstructed Sources.,Brain topography,2019,"Papadopoulou M, Friston K, Marinazzo D","In cognitive neuroscience, electrical brain activity is most commonly recorded at the scalp. In order to infer the contributions and connectivity of underlying neuronal sources within the brain, it is necessary to reconstruct sensor data at the source level. Several approaches to this reconstruction have been developed, thereby solving the so-called implicit inverse problem Michel et al. (Clin Neurophysiol 115:2195-2222, 2004). However, a unifying premise against which to validate these source reconstructions is seldom available. The dataset provided in this work, in which brain activity is simultaneously recorded on the scalp (non-invasively) by electroencephalography (EEG) and on the cortex (invasively) by electrocorticography (ECoG), can be of a great help in this direction. These multimodal recordings were obtained from a macaque monkey under wakefulness and sedation. Our primary goal was to establish the connectivity architecture between two sources of interest (frontal and parietal), and to assess how their coupling changes over the conditions. We chose these sources because previous studies have shown that the connections between them are modified by anaesthesia Boly et al. (J Neurosci 32:7082-7090, 2012). Our secondary goal was to evaluate the consistency of the connectivity results when analyzing sources recorded from invasive data (128 implanted ECoG sources) and source activity reconstructed from scalp recordings (19 EEG sensors) at the same locations as the ECoG sources. We conclude that the directed connectivity in the frequency domain between cortical sources reconstructed from scalp EEG is qualitatively similar to the connectivity inferred directly from cortical recordings, using both data-driven (directed transfer function) and biologically grounded (dynamic causal modelling) methods. Furthermore, the connectivity changes identified were consistent with previous findings Boly et al. (J Neurosci 32:7082-7090, 2012). Our findings suggest that inferences about directed connectivity based upon non-invasive electrophysiological data have construct validity in relation to invasive recordings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26350398/
26323737,Correlation of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring and end-tidal sevoflurane concentration in a patient with lobar holoprosencephaly.,Brazilian journal of anesthesiology (Elsevier),2015,"Galante D, Fortarezza D, Caggiano M, de Francisci G, Pedrotti D, Caruselli M","The bispectral index (BIS) is a parameter derived by electroencephalography (EEG) which provides a direct measurement of the effects of sedatives and anesthetics on the brain and offers guidance on the adequacy of anesthesia. The literature lacks studies on BIS monitoring in pediatric patients with congenital brain disease undergoing general anesthesia.
A 13-year-old child weighing 32kg, suffering from lobar holoprosencephaly, underwent surgery in which the bispectral index (BIS) monitoring the depth of anesthesia showed an abnormal response. Detailed analysis of the trends of BIS values in the different observation times demonstrated sudden falls and repetitive values of BIS likely related to repetitive epileptiform electrical activity caused by sevoflurane.
The BIS is a very useful monitoring tool for assessing the degree of depth of anesthesia and to analyze the electroencephalographic variations of anesthetics. Particular attention should be given to patients with congenital disorders of the central nervous system in which the BIS may give abnormal responses that do not reflect an accurate assessment of the depth of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26323737/
26315001,Cocaine use as an independent predictor of seizures after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,Journal of neurosurgery,2016,"Chang TR, Kowalski RG, Carhuapoma JR, Tamargo RJ, Naval NS","Seizures are relatively common after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Seizure prophylaxis is controversial and is often based on risk stratification; middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms, associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), poor neurological grade, increased clot thickness, and cerebral infarction are considered highest risk for seizures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of recent cocaine use on seizure incidence following aSAH.
Prospectively collected data from aSAH patients admitted to 2 institutional neuroscience critical care units between 1991 and 2009 were reviewed. The authors analyzed factors that potentially affected the incidence of seizures, including patient demographic characteristics, poor clinical grade (Hunt and Hess Grade IV or V), medical comorbidities, associated ICH, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hydrocephalus, aneurysm location, surgical clipping and cocaine use. They further studied the impact of these factors on ""early"" and ""late"" seizures (defined, respectively, as occurring before and after clipping/coiling).
Of 1134 aSAH patients studied, 182 (16%) had seizures; 81 patients (7.1%) had early and 127 (11.2%) late seizures, with 26 having both. The seizure rate was significantly higher in cocaine users (37 [26%] of 142 patients) than in non-cocaine users (151 [15.2%] of 992 patients, p = 0.001). Eighteen cocaine-positive patients (12.7%) had early seizures compared with 6.6% of cocaine-negative patients (p = 0.003); 27 cocaine users (19%) had late seizures compared with 10.5% non-cocaine users (p = 0.001). Factors that showed a significant association with increased risk for seizure (early or late) on univariate analysis included younger age (< 40 years) (p = 0.009), poor clinical grade (p = 0.029), associated ICH (p = 0.007), and MCA aneurysm location (p < 0.001); surgical clipping was associated with late seizures (p = 0.004). Following multivariate analysis, age < 40 years (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.355-3.058, p = 0.001), poor clinical grade (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.124-2.336, p = 0.01), ICH (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.164-3.273, p = 0.011), MCA aneurysm location (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.237-4.854, p < 0.001), and cocaine use (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.330-3.175, p = 0.001) independently predicted seizures.
Cocaine use confers a higher seizure risk following aSAH and should be considered during risk stratification for seizure prophylaxis and close neuromonitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26315001/

However, during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), factors other than the administered hypnotic agents may influence EEG signals, and their effects on BIS values are unknown.
This report is a secondary analysis of data from a prospective, controlled interventional study comparing the effect of sevoflurane administration guided by BIS monitoring (group SevoBIS) and constant administration of sevoflurane (group Sevo1.8Vol%) during CPB. Sevoflurane plasma concentration (SPC) was measured using gas chromatography. The relationships of BIS to SPC, CPB pump flow, arterial pressure, hematocrit, temperature, time on CPB, and patient characteristics were analysed.
No association was observed between BIS values and SPC in group SevoBIS. In group Sevo1.8Vol%, a 40 μg ml-1 increase in SPC, which encompassed the entire range of observed values of the SPC in this analysis, was associated with a decrease of 3.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-6.1) in BIS values (p = 0.005). Each increase in CPB time of 10 minutes was associated with an increase in BIS values of 0.25 (95%CI: 0.11-0.39, p<0.001). Path analysis revealed that the BIS values of SevoBIS patients were 5.3 (95%CI: 3.2-7.5) units higher than those of Sevo1.8Vol% patients (p<0.001), which was the strongest effect on BIS values. Path analysis revealed a slope of 0.5 (95%CI: 0.3-0.7) BIS units per 1°C body temperature (p<0.001).

Retrospective cohort study of patients who met clinical and EEG criteria of NCSE from 2009 to 2014 at a tertiary academic medical center. Patients were categorized according to IVAD use. Outcome variables were response to treatment and in-hospital death. We used descriptive analyses for baseline characteristics and outcome variable differences among patients who did and did not receive IVAD.
Forty-three patients had a total of 45 NCSE episodes. IVAD was used in 69% of the episodes. Patients treated with IVAD were younger (53.1 ± 14.1 vs 64.1 ± 13.3, p = 0.019). The episodes treated with IVAD occurred more frequently in patients with an acute neurologic pathology (58% vs 21%, p = 0.024) and those presenting in a coma (39% vs 7%, p = 0.030). NCSE resolved in 74% of the patients who received IVAD. Duration of NCSE did not differ significantly by treatment group. There were total 13 in-hospital deaths: ten in IVAD users vs three in the no-IVAD group (p > 0.05). Only one in-hospital death appeared to be a direct consequence of IVAD use. Mortality was more common among episodes that were not treated according to the published status epilepticus treatment guidelines compared to the episodes where guidelines were followed.
Our findings showed that factors such as younger age, acute neurologic pathology and coma at presentation were associated with IVAD use in patients with NCSE. These factors should be controlled in the future outcome and effectiveness studies to determine the effect of IVAD use on outcome of NCSE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26280805/
26256583,How the cortico-thalamic feedback affects the EEG power spectrum over frontal and occipital regions during propofol-induced sedation.,Journal of computational neuroscience,2015,"Hashemi M, Hutt A, Sleigh J","Increasing concentrations of the anaesthetic agent propofol initially induces sedation before achieving full general anaesthesia. During this state of anaesthesia, the observed specific changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms comprise increased activity in the δ- (0.5-4 Hz) and α- (8-13 Hz) frequency bands over the frontal region, but increased δ- and decreased α-activity over the occipital region. It is known that the cortex, the thalamus, and the thalamo-cortical feedback loop contribute to some degree to the propofol-induced changes in the EEG power spectrum. However the precise role of each structure to the dynamics of the EEG is unknown. In this paper we apply a thalamo-cortical neuronal population model to reproduce the power spectrum changes in EEG during propofol-induced anaesthesia sedation. The model reproduces the power spectrum features observed experimentally both in frontal and occipital electrodes. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the model indicates the importance of multiple resting states in brain activity. The work suggests that the α-activity originates from the cortico-thalamic relay interaction, whereas the emergence of δ-activity results from the full cortico-reticular-relay-cortical feedback loop with a prominent enforced thalamic reticular-relay interaction. This model suggests an important role for synaptic GABAergic receptors at relay neurons and, more generally, for the thalamus in the generation of both the δ- and the α- EEG patterns that are seen during propofol anaesthesia sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26256583/

In support of this, recent work by Casali et al (2013) has shown that Lempel-Ziv complexity correlates strongly with conscious level, when computed on the EEG response to transcranial magnetic stimulation. Here we investigated complexity of spontaneous high-density EEG data during propofol-induced general anaesthesia. We consider three distinct measures: (i) Lempel-Ziv complexity, which is derived from how compressible the data are; (ii) amplitude coalition entropy, which measures the variability in the constitution of the set of active channels; and (iii) the novel synchrony coalition entropy (SCE), which measures the variability in the constitution of the set of synchronous channels. After some simulations on Kuramoto oscillator models which demonstrate that these measures capture distinct 'flavours' of complexity, we show that there is a robustly measurable decrease in the complexity of spontaneous EEG during general anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26252378/

Once stabilised on an intensive care unit, it can be difficult to predict the neurological outcome using clinical criteria alone, particularly with modern management using sedation, neuromuscular blockade and hypothermia. If we are to prevent ongoing futile life support, it is important to try to identify the majority of patients who, despite best efforts, will not make a meaningful recovery.

The objective of the current study was to examine the temporal characteristics of the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) in a sample of children with critical illness.
Limited montage EEG recordings were collected for at least 24 hours from 8 critically ill children on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary-care hospital. Each PICU patient was age- and gender-matched to a healthy subject from the community. Power spectral analysis with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) was used to characterize EEG spectral power and categorized into 4 frequency bands: δ (0.8 to 4.0 Hz), θ (4.1 to 8.0 Hz), α (8.1 to 13.0 Hz), and β1/β2 (13.1 to 20.0 Hz).
PICU patients did not manifest the ultradian variability in EEG power spectra including the typical increase in δ-power during the first third of the night that was observed in healthy children. Differences noted included significantly lower mean nighttime δ and θ power in the PICU patients compared to healthy children (p < 0.001). Moreover, in the PICU patients, mean δ and θ power were higher during daytime hours than nighttime hours (p < 0.001).

We aimed to assess the sleep quality by polysomnography (PSG) in relation to delirium in mechanically ventilated non-sedated ICU patients.
Interpretation of 24-h PSG and clinical sleep assessment in 14 patients. Delirium assessment was done using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU).
Of four patients who were delirium free, only one had identifiable sleep on PSG. Sleep was disrupted with loss of circadian rhythm, and diminished REM sleep. In the remaining three patients the PSGs were atypical, meaning that no sleep signs were found, and sleep could not be quantified from the PSGs. Clinical total sleep time (ClinTST) ranged from 2.0-13.1 h in patients without delirium. Six patients with delirium all had atypical PSGs, so sleep could not be quantified. Short periods of REM sleep were found. ClinTST was median 8.5 h (range 0.4-13.8 h). EEG reactivity and wakefulness was found in all but one PSG. Four patients were CAM-ICU ""unassessable"" (unresponsive to voice). PSGs were atypical without reactivity or wakefulness, even though clinical wakefulness was documented. ClinTST was median 18.3 h (range 3.7-19.8 h). Paroxystic EEG activity was found in this subgroup.
The objective signs of sleep were absent in all but one PSG, so even though patients were not sedated, sleep could not be quantified. Even in patients without delirium, sleep could only be quantified in one of four patients. Paroxystic activity is frequent in unsedated patients, unresponsive to voice, but the implication is unknown.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26190149/
26174308,Response of bispectral index to neuromuscular block in awake volunteers.,British journal of anaesthesia,2015,"Schuller PJ, Newell S, Strickland PA, Barry JJ","The bispectral index (BIS) monitor is a quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) device that is widely used to assess the hypnotic component of anaesthesia, especially when neuromuscular blocking drugs are used. It has been shown that the BIS is sensitive to changes in electromyogram (EMG) activity in anaesthetized patients. A single study using an earlier version of the BIS showed that decreased EMG activity caused the BIS to decrease even in awake subjects, to levels that suggested deep sedation and anaesthesia.
We administered suxamethonium and rocuronium to 10 volunteers who were fully awake, to determine whether the BIS decreased in response to neuromuscular block alone. An isolated forearm technique was used for communication during the experiment. Two versions of the BIS monitor were used, both of which are in current use. Sugammadex was used to antagonise the neuromuscular block attributable to rocuronium.
The BIS decreased after the onset of neuromuscular block in both monitors, to values as low as 44 and 47, and did not return to pre-test levels until after the return of movement. The BIS showed a two-stage decrease, with an immediate reduction to values around 80, and then several minutes later, a sharp decrease to lower values. In some subjects, there were periods where the BIS was <60 for several minutes. The response was similar for both suxamethonium and rocuronium. Neither monitor was consistently superior in reporting the true state of awareness.
These results suggest that the BIS monitor requires muscle activity, in addition to an awake EEG, in order to generate values indicating that the subject is awake. Consequently, BIS may be an unreliable indicator of awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking drugs.

Neural circuits undergo structural and functional transformations during development that might be reflected in anaesthesia-induced EEG oscillations. We therefore investigated age-related changes in the EEG during sevoflurane general anaesthesia in paediatric patients.
We analysed the EEG recorded during routine care of patients between 0 and 28 yr of age (n=54), using power spectral and coherence methods. The power spectrum quantifies the energy in the EEG at each frequency, while the coherence measures the frequency-dependent correlation or synchronization between EEG signals at different scalp locations. We characterized the EEG as a function of age and within 5 age groups: <1 yr old (n=4), 1-6 yr old (n=12), >6-14 yr old (n=14), >14-21 yr old (n=11), >21-28 yr old (n=13).
EEG power significantly increased from infancy through ∼6 yr, subsequently declining to a plateau at approximately 21 yr. Alpha (8-13 Hz) coherence, a prominent EEG feature associated with sevoflurane-induced unconsciousness in adults, is absent in patients <1 yr.
Sevoflurane-induced EEG dynamics in children vary significantly as a function of age. These age-related dynamics likely reflect ongoing development within brain circuits that are modulated by sevoflurane. These readily observed paediatric-specific EEG signatures could be used to improve brain state monitoring in children receiving general anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26174303/

We postulated that anaesthesia-induced brain dynamics observed in the EEG change with age.
We analysed the EEG in 155 patients aged 18-90 yr who received propofol (n=60) or sevoflurane (n=95) as the primary anaesthetic. The EEG spectrum and coherence were estimated throughout a 2 min period of stable anaesthetic maintenance. Age-related effects were characterized by analysing power and coherence as a function of age using linear regression and by comparing the power spectrum and coherence in young (18- to 38-yr-old) and elderly (70- to 90-yr-old) patients.
Power across all frequency bands decreased significantly with age for both propofol and sevoflurane; elderly patients showed EEG oscillations ∼2- to 3-fold smaller in amplitude than younger adults. The qualitative form of the EEG appeared similar regardless of age, showing prominent alpha (8-12 Hz) and slow (0.1-1 Hz) oscillations. However, alpha band dynamics showed specific age-related changes. In elderly compared with young patients, alpha power decreased more than slow power, and alpha coherence and peak frequency were significantly lower. Older patients were more likely to experience burst suppression.
These profound age-related changes in the EEG are consistent with known neurobiological and neuroanatomical changes that occur during typical ageing. Commercial EEG-based depth-of-anaesthesia indices do not account for age and are therefore likely to be inaccurate in elderly patients. In contrast, monitoring the unprocessed EEG and its spectrogram can account for age and individual patient characteristics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26174300/

26174297,Changes in the electroencephalogram during anaesthesia and their physiological basis.,British journal of anaesthesia,2015,Hagihira S,"The use of EEG monitors to assess the level of hypnosis during anaesthesia has become widespread. Anaesthetists, however, do not usually observe the raw EEG data: they generally pay attention only to the Bispectral Index (BIS™) and other indices calculated by EEG monitors. This abstracted information only partially characterizes EEG features. To properly appreciate the availability and reliability of EEG-derived indices, it is necessary to understand how raw EEG changes during anaesthesia. With hemi-frontal lead EEGs obtained under volatile anaesthesia or propofol anaesthesia, the dominant EEG frequency decreases and the amplitude increases with increasing concentrations of anaesthetic. Looking more closely, the EEG changes are more complicated. At surgical concentrations of anaesthesia, spindle waves (alpha range) become dominant. At deeper levels, this activity decreases, and theta and delta waves predominate. At even deeper levels, EEG waveform changes into a burst and suppression pattern, and finally becomes flat. EEG waveforms vary in the presence of noxious stimuli (surgical skin incision), which is not always reflected in BIS™, or other processed EEG indices. Spindle waves are adequately sensitive, however, to noxious stimuli: under surgical anaesthesia they disappear when noxious stimuli are applied, and reappear when adequate analgesia is obtained. To prevent awareness during anaesthesia, I speculate that the most effective strategy is to administer anaesthetic agents in such a way as to maintain anaesthesia at a level where spindle waves predominate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26174297/

This potential remains limited by the significant ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts induced in the EEG by cardiac pulsation-related head movement within the magnetic field. We model the BCG artifact using a harmonic basis, pose the artifact removal problem as a local harmonic regression analysis, and develop an efficient maximum likelihood algorithm to estimate and remove BCG artifacts. Our analysis paradigm accounts for time-frequency overlap between the BCG artifacts and neurophysiologic EEG signals, and tracks the spatiotemporal variations in both the artifact and the signal. We evaluate performance on: simulated oscillatory and evoked responses constructed with realistic artifacts; actual anesthesia-induced oscillatory recordings; and actual visual evoked potential recordings. In each case, the local harmonic regression analysis effectively removes the BCG artifacts, and recovers the neurophysiologic EEG signals. We further show that our algorithm outperforms commonly used reference-based and component analysis techniques, particularly in low SNR conditions, the presence of significant time-frequency overlap between the artifact and the signal, and/or large spatiotemporal variations in the BCG. Because our algorithm does not require reference signals and has low computational complexity, it offers a practical tool for removing BCG artifacts from EEG data recorded in combination with fMRI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26151100/

Among others, reduced brain oxygenation accounts for neurological adverse outcomes after CPB. The aim of the present study was to ascertain if and how continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) during CPB is affected by hematocrit level and what should be the minimum value to avoid significant frequency band shifts on the EEG. A comparative study design was used with 16 subjects undergoing elective mitral valve repair/replacement. EEG was continuously recorded during the surgical procedure (from anesthesia induction to 20 min after CPB end). Data were marked at relevant time points (T0: before CPB start; T1: after 30 min from CPB beginning; T2: at CPB end), and the following 2 min EEG analyzed with a fast Fourier transform to obtain relative power for delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. A general linear model for repeated measure was used to study interactions of time (T0, T1, and T2, EEG frequency band, and topographical distribution. The relative powers for each electrode were calculated and represented using topographic maps. Power spectrum differences between time points (T2-T1; T2-T0; T1-T0) were calculated for each electrode, and differences >10%, considered indicative of neuronal sufferance, were included in further analysis. Cutoff hemoglobin values that maximize the proportion of correctly classified EEG band shifts were obtained by previous definition were obtained. At T2, diffuse EEG slowing in delta and theta bands was detected; a minor slowing over anterior regions was evident at T1 for the theta band. Decrements in EEG power greater than 10% were detected only for the delta band at T2. Hemoglobin concentration levels at which no slowing increase was evident were 9.4 mg/dL (Ht: 28.2%) at T1 and 9.2 mg/dL (Ht: 27.6%) at T2. EEG burst-suppression pattern related to a lesser degree of slowing at T2. In conclusion, we propose hemoglobin cutoff levels that prevent EEG slowing indicative of neuronal sufferance.

Previously, no attempt had been made to discover which EEG characteristics cause discrepancies between BIS and Entropy. We compared BIS and Entropy values, and analysed the changes in the raw EEG signal during surgical anaesthesia with sevoflurane.
In this prospective, open-label study, 65 patients receiving general anaesthesia with sevoflurane were enrolled. BIS, Entropy and multichannel digital EEG were recorded. Concurrent BIS and State Entropy (SE) values were selected. Whenever BIS and SE values showed ≥10-unit disagreement for ≥60 s, the raw EEG signal was analysed both in time and frequency domain.
A ≥10-unit disagreement ≥60 s was detected 428 times in 51 patients. These 428 episodes accounted for 5158 (11%) out of 45 918 analysed index pairs. During EEG burst suppression, SE was higher than BIS in 35 out of 49 episodes. During delta-theta dominance, BIS was higher than SE in 141 out of 157 episodes. During alpha or beta activity, SE was higher than BIS in all 49 episodes. During electrocautery, both BIS and SE changed, sometimes in the opposite direction, but returned to baseline values after electrocautery. Electromyography caused index disagreement four times (BIS > SE).
Certain specific EEG patterns, and artifacts, are associated with discrepancies between BIS and SE. Time and frequency domain analyses of the original EEG improve the interpretation of studies involving BIS, Entropy and other EEG-based indices.

The present study assessed the sleep-promoting (sedative-hypnotic) effects of Artemisia capillaris Thunberg (A. capillaris), and elucidated a possible mechanism behind its effect. ICR mice were given A. capillaris extract (oral) at different dosages (50, 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg/kg), distilled water (oral; control), or diazepam (intraperitoneal; reference drug). One hour after administration, locomotion (open-field test) and motor coordination (rota-rod test) were assessed. The extract's effect on pentobarbital-induced sleep was also evaluated. Additionally, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were measured in rats. To evaluate a possible mechanism behind its effects, changes in chloride ( Cl (-)) ion influx were measured in human neuroblastoma cells. As compared to the control group, mice treated with A. capillaris demonstrated significantly decreased locomotor activity and impaired motor balance and coordination. The extract also shortened the onset and lengthened the duration of sleep induced by pentobarbital sodium. These effects were comparable to that induced by diazepam. Furthermore, A. capillaris-treated rats showed increased delta and decreased alpha EEG waves; an electroencephalographic pattern indicative of relaxation or sedation. In neuroblastoma cells, the extract dose-dependently increased Cl (-) ion influx, which was blocked by co-administration of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor competitive antagonist, suggesting that its effects are mediated through the GABAA receptor- Cl (-) ion channel complex. Altogether, the results of the present study demonstrate that A. capillaris possesses potent sedative-hypnotic effects, which are probably mediated through potentiation of the GABAA receptor- Cl (-) ion channel complex.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26119953/
26118489,Nitrous oxide-induced slow and delta oscillations.,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,2016,"Pavone KJ, Akeju O, Sampson AL, Ling K, Purdon PL, Brown EN","Switching from maintenance of general anesthesia with an ether anesthetic to maintenance with high-dose (concentration >50% and total gas flow rate >4 liters per minute) nitrous oxide is a common practice used to facilitate emergence from general anesthesia. The transition from the ether anesthetic to nitrous oxide is associated with a switch in the putative mechanisms and sites of anesthetic action. We investigated whether there is an electroencephalogram (EEG) marker of this transition.
We retrospectively studied the ether anesthetic to nitrous oxide transition in 19 patients with EEG monitoring receiving general anesthesia using the ether anesthetic sevoflurane combined with oxygen and air.
Following the transition to nitrous oxide, the alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations associated with sevoflurane dissipated within 3-12 min (median 6 min) and were replaced by highly coherent large-amplitude slow-delta (0.1-4 Hz) oscillations that persisted for 2-12 min (median 3 min).
Administration of high-dose nitrous oxide is associated with transient, large amplitude slow-delta oscillations.
We postulate that these slow-delta oscillations may result from nitrous oxide-induced blockade of major excitatory inputs (NMDA glutamate projections) from the brainstem (parabrachial nucleus and medial pontine reticular formation) to the thalamus and cortex. This EEG signature of high-dose nitrous oxide may offer new insights into brain states during general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26118489/

Fifteen healthy young adult subjects voluntarily participated in the present study. Electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and corrugator muscle electromyogram (EMG) were recorded and changes of them by viewing videos of dental treatments were analyzed. The subjective discomfort level was acquired by Visual Analog Scale method. Analyses of autonomic nervous activities from ECG and four emotional factors (anger/stress, joy/satisfaction, sadness/depression and relaxation) from EEG demonstrated that increases in sympathetic nervous activity reflecting stress increase and decreases in relaxation level were induced by the videos of infiltration anesthesia and cavity excavation, but not intraoral examination. The corrugator muscle activity was increased by all three images regardless of video contents. The subjective discomfort during watching infiltration anesthesia and cavity excavation was higher than intraoral examination, showing that sympathetic activities and relaxation factor of emotion changed in a manner consistent with subjective emotional changes. These results suggest that measurement of autonomic nervous activities estimated from ECG and emotional factors analyzed from EEG is useful for objective evaluation of subjective emotion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26111531/

We used multi-electrode EEG, analyzed with multitaper spectral methods and video recording of body movement to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity in 36 infants 0-6 months old when awake, and during maintenance of and emergence from sevoflurane general anesthesia. During maintenance: (1) slow-delta oscillations were present in all ages; (2) theta and alpha oscillations emerged around 4 months; (3) unlike adults, all infants lacked frontal alpha predominance and coherence. Alpha power was greatest during maintenance, compared to awake and emergence in infants at 4-6 months. During emergence, theta and alpha power decreased with decreasing sevoflurane concentration in infants at 4-6 months. These EEG dynamic differences are likely due to developmental factors including regional differences in synaptogenesis, glucose metabolism, and myelination across the cortex. We demonstrate the need to apply age-adjusted analytic approaches to develop neurophysiologic-based strategies for pediatric anesthetic state monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26102526/

A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to estimate how much ESE identification and management would need to improve patient outcomes to make EEG monitoring strategies a good value.
A decision tree was created to examine the relationships among variables important to deciding whether to perform EEG monitoring. Variable costs were estimated from their component parts, outcomes were estimated in quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to compare the relative values using four alternative EEG monitoring strategies that varied by monitoring duration.
Forty-eight hours of EEG monitoring would be worth its cost if ESE identification and management improved patient outcomes by ≥7%. If ESE identification and management improved patient outcomes by 3% to 6%, then 24 or 48 hours of EEG monitoring would be worth the cost depending on how much decision makers were willing to pay per quality-adjusted life-year gained. If ESE identification and management improved outcomes by as little as 3%, then 24 hours of EEG monitoring would be worth the cost.

Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) has the potential to fill this gap but remains relatively unexplored. We conduct a retrospective review of consecutive patients with cerebrovascular malformations treated with Onyx (ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) embolization under general anesthesia with IONM from 2009 to 2012. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs), visual evoked potential (VEPs), auditory brainstem response (ABR), and electroencephalography (EEG) were used selectively in all patients depending on the location of the malformation. Provocative testing combined with IONM was performed in 28 patients over 75 sessions. Three patients demonstrated changes in TcMEPs or ABR during provocative testing, which halted the planned embolization. Two patients demonstrated changes in baseline SSEPs after embolization, despite normal IONM during provocative testing, correlating with postprocedural contralateral weakness. Six patients developed visual deficits after arterial occlusion despite unchanged VEPs and occipital EEG during provocative testing and embolization. We therefore conclude that the sensitivity of TcMEPs and SSEPs is preferable to EEG, and we strongly caution against relying on occipital recorded VEPs to predict visual deficits.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26036117/

However, despite medical and neuromodulatory therapy, a significant proportion of patients continue to experience disabling seizures that impair awareness, causing disability and risking injury or sudden unexplained death. We propose a novel strategy in which neuromodulation is used not only to reduce seizures but also to ameliorate impaired consciousness when the patient is in the ictal and postictal states. Improving or preventing alterations in level of consciousness may have an effect on morbidity (e.g., accidents, drownings, falls), risk for death, and quality of life. Recent studies may have elucidated underlying networks and mechanisms of impaired consciousness and yield potential novel targets for neuromodulation. The feasibility, benefits, and pitfalls of potential deep brain stimulation targets are illustrated in human and animal studies involving minimally conscious/vegetative states, movement disorders, depth of anesthesia, sleep-wake regulation, and epilepsy. We review evidence that viable therapeutic targets for impaired consciousness associated with seizures may be provided by key nodes of the consciousness system in the brainstem reticular activating system, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, thalamus, and basal forebrain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26030698/

The pattern was associated with myoclonus in 11 patients. EG reactivity to antiseizure drugs (benzodiazepines and propofol), but without clinical improvement, was noted in 8 patients, satisfying the diagnostic criteria of ""possible NCSE"". Resolution of GPDs and emergence of physiological rhythms in follow-up EEGs and/or subsequent clinical improvement were noted in 6 of them, strongly suggesting that the initial slow nonevolving GPD pattern reflected NCSE significantly contributing to their coma. Background rhythms from 10 to 90% of the periods between GPDs were noted in 9 patients and appeared to correlate with reactivity of the GPD pattern to antiseizure drugs when 20% or more. Ten patients died, and four were discharged to longer care rehabilitation centers. Although based on few observations, preliminary evidence appears to indicate that in this context, nonevolving GPD frequencies as low as 0.8 Hz can reflect clinically significant NCSE and, therefore, warrant appropriate testing for possible reactivity. There is also some preliminary indication that background rhythms may be another important diagnostic and, perhaps, prognostic indicator, but this needs to be tested in large prospective studies.

To the best of our knowledge, we describe the clinical, electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and neuropathological features of the first case of super-refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus (sr-NCSE) secondary to fat embolism.
An 82-year-old woman was transferred to our intensive care unit because of a sudden decrease of consciousness level, right hemiparesis, and acute respiratory failure in the early postoperative period of knee prosthesis surgery. Brain computed tomography (TC) including angio-CT and CT perfusion was normal. An urgent video-electroencephalography (v-EEG) evaluation showed continuous sharp-and slow-wave at 2.0-2.5 Hz in keeping with the diagnosis of generalized NCSE. Epileptiform discharges ceased after the administration of 5mg of intravenous diazepam, and background activity constituted by diffuse theta waves was observed without clinical improvement. Treatment with levetiracetam (1000 mg/day) and sedation with propofol and midazolam were initiated. Moreover, continuous v-EEG monitoring was also started. Despite antiepileptic therapy, epileptiform activity recurred after the interruption of profound sedation, and valproate and lacosamide were added during the ensuing days. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed small scattered foci of acute ischemic infarcts and diffuse petechiae involving the basal ganglia and pons and centrum semiovale in keeping with fat embolism. Super-refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus remained without control for 2 weeks. Finally, the patient died. The clinical autopsy revealed a bilateral lung fat embolism associated with a hemorrhagic infarction in the left lower lobe. Fatty lesions were also seen in the intestine and pancreas. Scattered microscopic cerebral infarcts associated with fat emboli in the capillaries were noticed, affecting both supra- and infratentorial structures. In addition, occasional focal areas of ischemic injury showing filiform neurons with reactive astrocytic gliosis background consistent with acute lesions were observed in CA3.

It is generally associated with coma of various etiologies (hypoxia, drug-related intoxication, hypothermia, and childhood encephalopathies, but also anesthesia). Animal studies suggest that both the cortex and the thalamus are involved in the generation of BS. However, very little is known about mechanisms of BS in humans. The aim of this study was to identify the neuronal network underlying both burst and suppression phases using source reconstruction and analysis of functional and effective connectivity in EEG.
Dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) was applied to EEG segments of 13 neonates and infants with burst and suppression EEG pattern. The brain area with the strongest power in the analyzed frequency (1-4 Hz) range was defined as the reference region. DICS was used to compute the coherence between this reference region and the entire brain. The renormalized partial directed coherence (RPDC) was used to describe the informational flow between the identified sources.
Delta activity during the burst phases was associated with coherent sources in the thalamus and brainstem as well as bilateral sources in cortical regions mainly frontal and parietal, whereas suppression phases were associated with coherent sources only in cortical regions. Results of the RPDC analyses showed an upwards informational flow from the brainstem towards the thalamus and from the thalamus to cortical regions, which was absent during the suppression phases. These findings may support the theory that a ""cortical deafferentiation"" between the cortex and sub-cortical structures exists especially in suppression phases compared to burst phases in burst suppression EEGs. Such a deafferentiation may play a role in the poor neurological outcome of children with these encephalopathies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25927439/

Three hundred children with an acute neurologic condition and altered mental status underwent clinically indicated EEG monitoring and were enrolled in a prospective observational study. We obtained follow-up data from subjects who were neurodevelopmentally normal prior to PICU admission. We evaluated for associations between ESE and adaptive behavior (Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II, ABAS-II), behavioral and emotional problems (Child Behavior Checklist, CBCL), and executive function (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, BRIEF) using linear regression analyses. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant.
One hundred thirty-seven of 300 subjects were neurodevelopmentally normal prior to PICU admission. We obtained follow-up data from 36 subjects for the CBCL, 32 subjects for the ABAS-II, and 20 subjects for the BRIEF. The median duration from admission to follow-up was 2.6 years (IQR: 1.2-3.8). There were no differences in the acute care variables (age, sex, mental status category, intubation status, paralysis status, acute neurologic diagnosis category, seizure category, EEG background category, or short-term outcome) between subjects with and without follow-up data for any of the outcome measures.

25812488,How to monitor the brain in septic patients?,Minerva anestesiologica,2015,"Oddo M, Taccone FS","Brain injury is frequently observed after sepsis and may be primarily related to the direct effects of the septic insult on the brain (e.g., brain edema, ischemia, seizures) or to secondary/indirect injuries (e.g., hypotension, hypoxemia, hypocapnia, hyperglycemia). Management of brain injury in septic patients is first focused to exclude structural intracranial complications (e.g., ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke) and possible confounders (e.g., electrolyte alterations or metabolic disorders, such as dysglycemia). Sepsis-associated brain dysfunction is frequently a heterogeneous syndrome. Despite increasing understanding of main pathophysiologic determinants, therapy is essentially limited to protect the brain against further cerebral damage, by way of ""simple"" therapeutic manipulations of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation and by avoiding over-sedation. Non-invasive monitoring of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation with transcranial Doppler (TCD) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is feasible in septic patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) allows detection of sepsis-related seizures and holds promise also as sedation monitoring. Brain CT-scan detects intra-cerebral structural lesions, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides important insights into primary mechanisms of sepsis-related direct brain injury, (e.g., cytotoxic vs. vasogenic edema) and the development of posterior reversible encephalopathy. Together with EEG and evoked potentials (EP), MRI is also important for coma prognostication. Emerging clinical evidence suggests monitoring of the brain in septic patients can be implemented in the ICU. The objective of this review was to summarize recent clinical data about the role of brain monitoring - including TCD, NIRS, EEG, EP, CT, and MRI - in patients with sepsis and to illustrate its potential utility for the diagnosis, management and prognostication.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25812488/

Approximately 1 in 5 patients with mTBI will develop chronic pain (headache and widespread pain, possibly of central origin) and/or sleep problems (insomnia, disordered breathing, periodic limb movements). However, the predisposing mechanisms for chronic pain in patients with mTBI are unknown. Mild traumatic brain injury is a rare model to prospectively assess the risk factors and mechanisms for pain chronification from the injury onset in the absence of pretrauma comorbidity or medication. In the acute phase, headaches and sleep disturbances seem to predict the poorest long-term cognitive and mood outcomes. Although recent studies suggest that certain brain biomarkers and mood alterations (eg, anxiety, depression) contribute, the causality of chronic pain remains unclear. In mTBI patients with pain, poor sleep quality was correlated with fast beta and gamma electroencephalographic activity in frontal, central, and occipital electroencephalographic (EEG) derivations in all sleep stages. Sleep recuperative function seems to be disturbed by persistent wake EEG activity, corroborating patient complaints such as feeling awake when asleep. Pain and sleep management in mTBI is not yet evidence-based. Treatments include cognitive behavioral and light therapies, medications, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or oral appliances for disordered sleep breathing. Customized approaches are indicated for mTBI, pain, and sleep complaints. Further studies in pediatric, sport, and transportation populations are needed to prevent TBI chronification.

Prospective, single-center, observational study of consecutive patients admitted with severe sepsis to the Medical ICU at an academic medical center.
A total of 98 patients with 100 episodes of severe sepsis were included; 49 patients (50%) were female, median age was 60 (IQR 52-74), the median non-neuro APACHE II score was 23.5 (IQR 18-28) and median non-neuro SOFA score was 8 (IQR 6-11). Twenty-five episodes had periodic discharges (PD), of which 11 had nonconvulsive seizures (NCS). No patient had NCS without PD. Prior neurological history was associated with a higher risk of PD or NCS (45 vs. 17%; CI 1.53-10.43), while the non-neuro APACHE II, non-neuro SOFA, severity of cardiovascular shock and presence of sedation during cEEG were associated with a lower risk of PD or NCS. Clinical seizures before cEEG were associated with a higher risk of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (24 vs. 6%; CI 1.42-19.94) while the non-neuro APACHE II and non-neuro SOFA scores were associated with a lower risk. Lack of EEG reactivity was present in 28% of episodes. In the survival analysis, a lack of EEG reactivity was associated with higher 1-year mortality [mean survival time 3.3 (95% CI 1.8-4.9) vs. 7.5 (6.4-8.7) months; p = 0.002] but the presence of PD or NCS was not [mean survival time 3.3 (95% CI 1.8-4.9) vs. 7.5 (6.4-8.7) months; p = 0.592].

There were no significant predictors of functional outcome, late cognition, and no patient with complete follow-up data developed late seizure or new epilepsy.
NCS and PD are common in patients with severe sepsis and altered mental status. They were less frequent among the most severely sick patients and were not associated with outcome in this study. Lack of EEG reactivity was more frequent in patients on continuous sedation and was associated with mortality up to 1 year after discharge.

Forty PERG records were analysed; 20 selected at random and 20 from eyes with good vision (fellow eyes or eyes with mild ONH) from over 300 records. Two experts identified P50 and N95 of the PERGs after manually deleting trials with movement artefact, slow-wave EEG (4-8 Hz) or other noise from raw data for 150 check reversals. The automated system first identified present/not-present responses using a magnitude-squared coherence criterion and then, for responses confirmed as present, estimated the P50 and N95 cardinal positions as the turning points in local third-order polynomials fitted in the -3 dB bandwidth [0.25 … 45] Hz. Confidence limits were estimated from bootstrap re-sampling with replacement. The automated system uses an interactive Internet-available webpage tool (see http://clinengnhs.liv.ac.uk/esp_perg_1.htm).
The automated system detected 28 PERG signals above the noise level (p ≤ 0.05 for H0). Good subjective quality ratings were indicative of significant PERGs; however, poor subjective quality did not necessarily predict non-significant signals. P50 and N95 implicit times showed good agreement between the two experts and between experts and the automated system. For the N95 amplitude measured to P50, the experts differed by an average of 13% consistent with differing interpretations of peaks within noise, while the automated amplitude measure was highly correlated with the expert measures but was proportionally larger. Trial-by-trial review of these data required approximately 6.5 h for each human expert, while automated data processing required <4 min, excluding overheads relating to data transfer.
An automated computer system for PERG analysis, using a panel of signal processing and statistical techniques, provides objective present/not-present detection and cursor positioning with explicit confidence intervals. The system achieves, within an efficient and robust statistical framework, estimates of P50 and N95 amplitudes and implicit times similar to those of clinical experts.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25761929/

Previous literature interprets this effect as a pre-attentive and unconscious processing of sensory stimuli. By contrast, a violation to auditory global regularities, i.e. based on repeating groups of sounds, is typically detectable when subjects can consciously perceive them. Here, we challenge the notion that global detection implies consciousness by testing the neural response to global violations in a group of 24 patients with post-anoxic coma (three females, age range 45-87 years), treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia and sedation. By applying a decoding analysis to electroencephalographic responses to standard versus deviant sound sequences, we found above-chance decoding performance in 10 of 24 patients (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 0.001), despite five of them being mildly hypothermic, sedated and unarousable. Furthermore, consistently with previous findings based on the mismatch negativity the progression of this decoding performance was informative of patients' chances of awakening (78% predictive of awakening). Our results show for the first time that detection of global regularities at neural level exists despite a deeply unconscious state.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25740220/

Bispectral (BIS) index monitor is one of the famous and important indicators for anesthesiologists primarily using EEG signals when assessing the DOA. In this study, an attempt is made to build a new indicator using EEG signals to provide a more valuable reference to the DOA for clinical researchers. The EEG signals are collected from patients under anesthetic surgery which are filtered using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) method and analyzed using sample entropy (SampEn) analysis. The calculated signals from SampEn are utilized to train an artificial neural network (ANN) model through using expert assessment of consciousness level (EACL) which is assessed by experienced anesthesiologists as the target to train, validate, and test the ANN. The results that are achieved using the proposed system are compared to BIS index. The proposed system results show that it is not only having similar characteristic to BIS index but also more close to experienced anesthesiologists which illustrates the consciousness level and reflects the DOA successfully.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25738152/

However, PE has not yet been evaluated for its clinical applicability as an indicator of anesthetic depth in children. Therefore, in order to investigate the validity of PE, we compared PE with BIS using pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling in children. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was obtained from BIS monitor during sevoflurane deepening and lightening protocol. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration (Etsevo) and BIS were measured simultaneously. PE was calculated from the processed EEG with the scale ranging from 0 to 100. NONMEM software was used to investigate the PD relationship between Etsevo with BIS and PE. Adjusted PE (APE) values were decreased as anesthesia deepened. APE and BIS showed significant linear correlation (P < 0.001), indicating that PE also reflects anesthesia depth. PD parameters for APE and BIS were estimated with a sigmoid Emax model which describes the relationship between Etsevo and APE/BIS (E o : 78, E max : 17.6, C e50 : 2.5 vol%; γ: 13.1, k eo : 0.47 min(-1) for APE; E o : 89.4; E max : 15.7; C e50 : 2.2 vol%; γ: 6.6, keo: 0.52 min(-1) for BIS).

Ideal agent should be short acting with minimal suppression of seizure potentials. Recent studies have suggested longer seizure duration with etomidate in comparison to propofol, thiopental, and methohexital. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to pool data available from studies comparing systematically the efficacy of etomidate against other induction agents in terms of seizure duration (both electroencephalography (EEG) and motor).
We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane registry for trials evaluating etomidate against methohexital, propofol, or thiopental for duration of EEG or motor seizure in patients undergoing ECT. Specific adverse effects reported were also identified.
Seventeen trials were identified involving 704, 84, 2491, and 258 setting of ECT using etomidate, methohexital, thiopental, and propofol, respectively. In the etomidate group, pooled EEG seizure duration was longer by 2.23 seconds (95% confidence interval [CI], -3.62 to 8.01; P = 0.456) than methohexital, longer by 17.65 seconds (95% CI, 9.72-25.57; P < 0.001) than propofol, and longer by 11.81 seconds (95% CI, 4.26-19.35; P = 0.003) than thiopental. Pooled motor seizure duration was longer in etomidate group by 1.45 seconds (95% CI, -4.79 to 7.69; P = 0.649) than methohexital, longer by 11.13 seconds (95% CI, 6.64-15.62; P < 0.001) than propofol, and longer by 3.60 seconds (95% CI, 2.15-5.06; P < 0.001) than thiopental. Myoclonus (6 trials) and painful injection (4 trials) were commonest adverse effects with etomidate.

25629593,Predictive value of the bispectral index for burst suppression on diagnostic electroencephalogram during drug-induced coma.,The Journal of neuroscience nursing : journal of the American Association of Neuroscience Nurses,2015,"Arbour RB, Dissin J","To determine correlation and predictive value between data obtained with the bispectral index (BIS) and diagnostic electroencephalogram (EEG) in determining degree of burst suppression during drug-induced coma. This study seeks to answer the question: ""To what degree can EEG suppression and burst count as measured by diagnostic EEG during drug-induced coma be predicted from data obtained from the BIS such as BIS value, suppression ratio (SR), and burst count?""
During drug-induced coma, cortical EEG is the gold standard for real-time monitoring and drug titration. Diagnostic EEG is, from setup through data analysis, labor intensive, costly, and difficult to maintain uniform clinician competency. BIS monitoring is less expensive, less labor-intensive, and easier to interpret data and establish/maintain competency. Validating BIS data versus diagnostic EEG facilitates effective brain monitoring during drug-induced coma at lower cost with similar outcomes.
This is a prospective, observational cohort study. Four consecutive patients receiving drug-induced coma/EEG monitoring were enrolled. BIS was initiated after informed consent. Variables recorded per minute included presence or absence of EEG burst suppression, burst count, BIS value over time, burst count, and SR. Pearson's product-moment and Spearman rank coefficient for BIS value and SR versus burst count were performed. Regression analysis was utilized to plot BIS values versus bursts/minute on EEG as well as SR versus burst count on EEG. EEG/BIS data were collected from digital data files and transcribed onto data sheets for corresponding time indices.
Four patients yielded 1,972 data sets over 33 hours of EEG/BIS monitoring. Regression coefficient of 0.6673 shows robust predictive value between EEG burst count and BIS SR. Spearman rank coefficient of -0.8727 indicates strong inverse correlation between EEG burst count and BIS SR. Pearson's correlation coefficient between EEG versus BIS burst count was .8256 indicating strong positive correlation. Spearman's rank coefficient of 0.8810 and Pearson's correlation coefficient of .6819 showed strong correlation between BIS value versus EEG burst count. Number of patients (4) limits available statistics and ability to generalize results. Graphs and statistics show strong correlation/predictive value for BIS parameters to EEG suppression.
This study is the first to measure correlation and predictive value between BIS monitoring and diagnostic EEG for degree of EEG suppression and burst count in the adult population. Available statistic tests and graphing of variables from BIS and diagnostic EEG show strong correlation and predictive value between both monitoring technologies during drug-induced coma. These support using BIS value, SR, and burst count to predict degree of EEG suppression in real time for titrating metabolic suppression therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25629593/

We evaluated the cost effectiveness of 4 electrographic seizure identification strategies (no EEG monitoring and EEG monitoring for 1 hour, 24 hours, or 48 hours).
We created a decision tree to model the relationships among variables from a societal perspective. To provide input for the model, we estimated variable costs directly related to EEG monitoring from their component parts, and we reviewed the literature to estimate the probabilities of outcomes. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to identify the trade-off between cost and effectiveness at different willingness-to-pay values.
Our analysis found that the preferred strategy was EEG monitoring for 1 hour, 24 hours, and 48 hours if the decision maker was willing to pay <$1,666, $1,666-$22,648, and >$22,648 per critically ill child identified with electrographic seizures, respectively. The 48-hour strategy only identified 4% more children with electrographic seizures at substantially higher cost. Sensitivity analyses found that all 3 strategies were acceptable at lower willingness-to-pay values when children with higher electrographic seizure risk were monitored.
The results of this study support monitoring of critically ill children for 24 hours because the cost to identify a critically ill child with electrographic seizures is modest. Further study is needed to predict better which children may benefit from 48 hours of EEG monitoring because the costs are much higher.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25626776/
25600373,Closing the gap between the molecular and systemic actions of anesthetic agents.,"Advances in pharmacology (San Diego, Calif.)",2015,Antkowiak B,"Genetic approaches have been successfully used to relate the diverse molecular actions of anesthetic agents to their amnestic, sedative, hypnotic, and immobilizing properties. The hypnotic effect of etomidate, quantified as the duration of the loss of righting reflex in mice, is equally mediated by GABAA receptors containing β2- and β3-protein subunits. However, only β3-containing receptors are involved in producing electroencephalogram (EEG)-patterns typical of general anesthesia. The sedative action of diazepam is produced by α1-subunit-containing receptors, but these receptors do not contribute to the drug's characteristic EEG-""fingerprint."" Thus, GABAA receptors with α1- and β2-subunits take a central role in causing benzodiazepine-induced sedation and etomidate-induced hypnosis, but the corresponding EEG-signature is difficult to resolve. Contrastingly, actions of etomidate and benzodiazepines mediated via α2- and β3-subunits modify rhythmic brain activity in vitro and in vivo at least in part by enhancing neuronal synchrony. The immobilizing action of GABAergic anesthetics predominantly involves β3-subunit-containing GABAA receptors in the spinal cord. Interestingly, this action is self-limiting as GABA-release is attenuated via the same receptors. Anesthetic-induced amnesia is in part mediated by GABAA receptors harboring α5-subunits that are highly enriched in the hippocampus and, in addition, by α1-containing receptors in the forebrain. Because there is accumulating evidence that in patients the expression pattern of GABAA receptor subtypes varies with age, is altered by the long-term use of drugs, and is affected by pathological conditions like inflammation and sepsis, further research is recommended to adapt the use of anesthetic agents to the specific requirements of individual patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25600373/

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare, side by side, the cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) and processed electroencephalogram (EEG) response bilaterally to carotid artery clamping and shunting in patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia. With institutional approval and written informed consent, patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia and routine carotid artery shunting were recorded bilaterally, simultaneously and continuously with an rSO2 and processed EEG monitor. The response of the monitors during carotid artery clamping and shunting were assessed and compared between monitors and bilaterally within each monitor. Sixty-nine patients were included in the study. At clamping the surgical-side and contralateral-side rSO2 dropped significantly below the baseline incision value (-17.6 and -9.4% respectively). After shunting, the contralateral-side rSO2 returned to baseline while the surgical-side rSO2 remained significantly below baseline (-9.0%) until the shunt was removed following surgery. At clamping the surgical-side and contralateral-side processed EEG also dropped below baseline (-19.9 and -20.6% respectively). However, following shunt activation, the processed EEG returned bilaterally to baseline. During the course of this research, we found the rSO2 monitor to be clinically more robust (4.4% failure rate) than the processed EEG monitor (20.0% failure rate). There was no correlation between the rSO2 or processed EEG changes that occurred immediately after clamping and the degree of surgical side stenosis measured pre-operatively. Both rSO2 and processed EEG respond to clamping and shunting during CEA. Cerebral oximetry discriminates between the surgical and contralateral side during surgery. The rSO2 monitor is more reliable in the real-world clinical setting. Future studies should focus on developing algorithms based on these monitors that can predict clamping-induced cerebral ischemia during CEA in order to decide whether carotid artery shunting is worth the associated risks. From the practical point of view, the rSO2 monitor may be the better monitor for this purpose.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25572653/

Annual International Conference,2014,"Kim J, Hyub H, Yoon SZ, Choi HJ, Kim KM, Park SH","Real-time quantification of the patient's consciousness level during anesthesia is an important issue to avoid intraoperative awareness and post-operative side effects. A depth-of-anesthesia (DoA) monitoring method called Bispectral Index (BIS) is generally used for this purpose. However, BIS is known to be inaccurate at the transitory state, and also shows a critical time delay in quantifying the patient's consciousness level. This paper introduces a novel method to reduce the response time in the quantification process. This thesis develops a new index called HDoA by analyzing EEG using Hidden Markov Model. The proposed approach is composed by two steps, training and testing. In the training step, two HMM, awakened and anesthetized model are learned based on each training set. In the testing step, by evaluating the probability of producing the testing EEG from two models respectively, the index HDoA is derived. Since the evaluation of DoA using HMM is training based method, it have better performance with more training process. Experiments show that HDoA has a high correlation with BIS at a steady state, and outperforms BIS in two ways: (1) shorter delay time in transition state, and (2) higher Fisher Score. The validity of HDoA has been tested by 8 real clinical data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25571010/

The purpose of this review is to provide a concise overview of SAD including the epidemiology and current diagnostic criteria for SAD. We present in detail the pathophysiology with regards to blood-brain-barrier breakdown, cytokine activation and neurotransmitter deregulation. Treatment and prognosis for SAD are also briefly discussed. SAD is the most common form of delirium acquired in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit), and is described in about 50% of septic patients. Clinical features include altered level of consciousness, reduced attention, change in cognition and perceptual disturbances. Symptoms can reversible, but prolonged deficits can be observed in older patients. Pathophysiology of SAD is poorly understood, but involves microvascular, metabolic and, not least, inflammatory mechanisms leading to CNS dysfunction. These mechanisms can be different in SAD compared to ICU delirium associated with other conditions. SAD is diagnosed clinically using validated tools such as CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Medicine) or ICDSC (The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist), which have good specificity but low sensitivity. Neuroimaging studies and EEG (Electroencephalography) can be useful complement to clinical evaluation to define the severity of the condition. Prompt diagnosis and eradication of septic foci whenever possible is vital. Preventive measures for SAD in the critically ill patient requiring long-term sedation include maintaining light levels of sedation using non-benzodiazepine sedatives (either propofol or dexmedetomidine). Early mobilization of patients in the ICU is also recommended. Antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol and atypical antipsychotics) are widely used to treat SAD, but firm evidence of their efficacy is lacking.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25567339/

Prediction probability (PK) of state entropy to discriminate consciousness from unconsciousness. Correlation and agreement between state entropy and BIS from deep to light hypnosis. Analysis of raw EEG compared with index values that are in conflict with clinical examination, with frequency measures (frequency bands/Spectral Edge Frequency 95) and visual inspection for physiological EEG patterns (e.g. beta or delta arousal), pathophysiological features such as high-frequency signals (electromyogram/high-frequency EEG or eye fluttering/saccades), different types of electro-oculogram or epileptiform EEG and technical artefacts.
PK of state entropy was 0.80 and of BIS 0.84; correlation coefficient of state entropy with BIS 0.78. Nine percent BIS and 14% state entropy values disagreed with clinical examination. Highest incidence of disagreement occurred after state transitions, in particular for state entropy after loss of consciousness during sevoflurane anaesthesia. EEG sequences which led to false 'conscious' index values often showed high-frequency signals and eye blinks. High-frequency EEG/electromyogram signals were pooled because a separation into EEG and fast electro-oculogram, for example eye fluttering or saccades, on the basis of a single EEG channel may not be very reliable. These signals led to higher Spectral Edge Frequency 95 and ratio of relative beta and gamma band power than EEG signals, indicating adequate unconscious classification. The frequency of other artefacts that were assignable, for example technical artefacts, movement artefacts, was negligible and they were excluded from analysis.
High-frequency signals and eye blinks may account for index values that falsely indicate consciousness. Compared with BIS, state entropy showed more false classifications of the clinical state at transition between consciousness and unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25564779/

Those standard models have used the full spectrum of EEG signals together with the systolic-diastolic pressure and pulse values. As it is generally agreed today that the brain is in stable state and the delta-theta bands of the EEG spectrum remain active during anesthesia. Considering this background, two questions that motivates this paper. First, determining the amount of gas to be administered is whether feasable from the spectrum of EEG during the maintenance stage of surgical operations. Second, more specifically, the delta-theta bands of the EEG spectrum are whether sufficient alone for this aim. This research aims to answer these two questions together. Discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) were applied to the EEG signals to extract delta-theta bands. The power density spectrum (PSD) values of target bands were presented as inputs to multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network (NN), which predicted the gas level.

This universally accepted approach fails to exploit the temporal continuity in the data and is not well-suited for signals with highly structured time-frequency representations. For a time series whose time-varying mean is the superposition of a small number of oscillatory components, we formulate nonparametric batch spectral analysis as a Bayesian estimation problem. We introduce prior distributions on the time-frequency plane that yield maximum a posteriori (MAP) spectral estimates that are continuous in time yet sparse in frequency. Our spectral decomposition procedure, termed spectrotemporal pursuit, can be efficiently computed using an iteratively reweighted least-squares algorithm and scales well with typical data lengths. We show that spectrotemporal pursuit works by applying to the time series a set of data-derived filters. Using a link between Gaussian mixture models, l1 minimization, and the expectation-maximization algorithm, we prove that spectrotemporal pursuit converges to the global MAP estimate. We illustrate our technique on simulated and real human EEG data as well as on human neural spiking activity recorded during loss of consciousness induced by the anesthetic propofol. For the EEG data, our technique yields significantly denoised spectral estimates that have significantly higher time and frequency resolution than multitaper spectral estimates. For the neural spiking data, we obtain a new spectral representation of neuronal firing rates. Spectrotemporal pursuit offers a robust spectral decomposition framework that is a principled alternative to existing methods for decomposing time series into a small number of smooth oscillatory components.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25468968/

We developed a seizure prediction model using a retrospectively acquired multi-center database of children with acute encephalopathy without an epilepsy diagnosis, who underwent clinically indicated CEEG. We performed model validation using a separate prospectively acquired single center database. Predictor variables were chosen to be readily available to clinicians prior to the onset of CEEG and included: age, etiology category, clinical seizures prior to CEEG, initial EEG background category, and inter-ictal discharge category.
The model has fair to good discrimination ability and overall performance. At the optimal cut-off point in the validation dataset, the model has a sensitivity of 59% and a specificity of 81%. Varied cut-off points could be chosen to optimize sensitivity or specificity depending on available CEEG resources.
Despite inherent variability between centers, a model developed using multi-center CEEG data and few readily available variables could guide the use of limited CEEG resources when applied at a single center. Depending on CEEG resources, centers could choose lower cut-off points to maximize identification of all patients with seizures (but with more patients monitored) or higher cut-off points to reduce resource utilization by reducing monitoring of lower risk patients (but with failure to identify some patients with seizures).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25458097/

We tested the hypothesis that the LSR is mediated by corticobulbar components by comparing the LSR during total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) or TIVA plus desflurane during microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery.
22 HFS patients undergoing MVD surgery participated in this prospective study. The LSR data was recorded from the o. oculi, o. oris and mentalis muscles prior to opening dura. LSR onset latencies and amplitudes were determined under TIVA and TIVA/desflurane (0.5 and 1MAC). Facial muscle LSRs and EEG were analyzed.
Desflurane (1MAC) significantly decreased the LSR amplitude in all 3 facial muscles (p<0.01). Pooled LSR data from all facial muscles showed desflurane inhibited the LSR amplitude by 43% compared to TIVA (p<0.001). No effects on the latency of the LSR or on EEG state were observed.
LSR inhibition by desflurane suggests a central mechanism involvement in the genesis of this signature HFS response.
This study demonstrates that facial nerve vascular compression and plastic changes within the CNS are part of the pathophysiology of HFS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25454282/

The association between anesthesia depth and presurgery physical and health status, however, is currently debated. Depression is one comorbid condition that warrants investigation given its association to reduced frontal lobe activity and high prevalence in known surgery samples (e.g., gynecologic mass removal).
This pilot study examined the hypothesis that severity of acute depressive symptoms would associate with greater sensitivity to anesthesia as measured by a frontal lobe electroencephalogram (EEG)-based monitor during the anesthesia induction phase among women undergoing gynecologic mass removal.
This was a prospective and surgery anesthesia-controlled pilot investigation with 31 women undergoing surgery for removal of pelvic/gynecologic masses. Participants completed the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (MBMD) inventory to assess depressive-related symptomatology. A Bispectral Index Score (BIS™) monitor (Aspect Medical Systems Inc., MA) was placed on the left frontal region to measure change in response from a set pre-anesthesia baseline point throughout the induction phase (6.5 min of the anesthetic). BIS™ change was calculated using a modified ""area under the curve with respect to ground"" formula.
Greater sensitivity to anesthesia during induction was significantly associated with higher MBMD future pessimism scores and marginally associated with higher MBMD depression scores. Depressive personality, anxiety severity, tumor type, age, medication use, and comorbidity scores were not found to be predictors of BIS score change.
These pilot findings suggest that preoperative psychological health and anesthesia response are not independent. Acute presurgery depression and anesthesia response warrant closer empirical examination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25421878/

One way to assess causal relationships between brain regions is given by renormalized partial directed coherence (rPDC). Importantly, directional connectivity is evaluated in the frequency domain by taking into account the whole multichannel EEG, as opposed to time domain or two channel approaches. rPDC was applied here in order to investigate propofol induced changes in causal connectivity between four states of consciousness: awake (AWA), deep sedation (SED), loss (LOC) and return of consciousness (ROC) by gathering full 10/20 system human EEG data in ten healthy male subjects. The target-controlled drug infusion was started at low rate with subsequent gradual stepwise increases at 10 min intervals in order to carefully approach LOC (defined as loss of motor responsiveness to a verbal stimulus). The direction of the causal EEG-network connections clearly changed from AWA to SED and LOC. Propofol induced a decrease (p = 0.002-0.004) in occipital-to-frontal rPDC of 8-16 Hz EEG activity and an increase (p = 0.001-0.040) in frontal-to-occipital rPDC of 10-20 Hz activity on both sides of the brain during SED and LOC. In addition, frontal-to-parietal rPDC within 1-12 Hz increased in the left hemisphere at LOC compared to AWA (p = 0.003). However, no significant changes were detected between the SED and the LOC states. The observed decrease in back-to-front EEG connectivity appears compatible with impaired information flow from the posterior sensory and association cortices to the executive prefrontal areas, possibly related to decreased ability to perceive the surrounding world during sedation. The observed increase in the opposite (front-to-back) connectivity suggests a propofol concentration dependent association and is not directly related to the level of consciousness per se.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25419791/
25410376,Monitoring depth of anesthesia: from consciousness to nociception. A window on subcortical brain activity.,Paediatric anaesthesia,2015,"Constant I, Sabourdin N","Anesthesia results from several inhibitor processes, which interact to lead to loss of consciousness, amnesia, immobility, and analgesia. The anesthetic agents act on the whole brain, the cortical and subcortical areas according to their receptor targets. The conscious processes are rather integrated at the level of the cortical neuronal network, while the nonconscious processes such as the nociception or implicit memory require subcortical processing. A reliable and meaningful monitoring of depth of anesthesia should provide assessment of these different processes. Besides the EEG monitoring which gives mainly information on cortical anesthetic effects, it would be relevant to have also a subcortical feedback allowing an assessment of nociception. Several devices have been proposed in this last decade, to give us an idea of the analgesia/nociception balance. Up to now, most of them are based on the assessment of the autonomic response to noxious stimulation. Among the emerging clinical devices, we can mention those which assess vascular sympathetic response (skin conductance), cardiac and vascular sympathetic response (surgical pleth index), parasympathetic cardiac response (analgesia nociception index), and finally the pupillometry which is based on the assessment of the pupillary reflex dilatation induced by nociceptive stimulations. Basically, the skin conductance might be the most adapted to assess the stress in the awake or sedated neonate, while the performances of this method appear disappointing under anesthesia. The surgical pleth index is still poorly investigated in children. The analgesia nociception index showed promising results in adults, which have to be confirmed, especially in children and in infants, and lastly pupillometry, which can be considered as reliable and reactive in children as in adults, but which is still sometimes complicated in its use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25410376/

Our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of ASs has been greatly advanced by the availability of genetic and pharmacological models, in particular the γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) model which, in recent years, has been extensively used in studies in transgenic mice. GHB is an endogenous brain molecule that upon administration to various species, including humans, induces not only ASs but also a state of sedation/hypnosis. Analysis of the available data clearly indicates that only in the rat does there exist a set of GHB-elicited behavioral and EEG events that can be confidently classified as ASs. Other GHB activities, particularly in mice, appear to be mostly of a sedative/hypnotic nature: thus, their relevance to ASs requires further investigation. At the molecular level, GHB acts as a weak GABA-B agonist, while the existence of a GHB receptor remains elusive. The pre- and postsynaptic actions underlying GHB-elicited ASs have been thoroughly elucidated in thalamus, but little is known about the cellular/network effects of GHB in neocortex, the other brain region involved in the generation of ASs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25403866/

Cooperation and immobility of the patient is crucial and in children who do not naturally sleep, pharmacological agents and procedural sedation should be used for sleep inducement. The purpose of this study was to compare efficacy and safety of melatonin and intravenous solution of midazolam administered orally in sedation induction for EEG of children.
In a parallel single-blinded randomized clinical trial, sixty 1 - 8 year old children who were referred to EEG Unit of Shahid Sadoughi Hospital, Yazd, Iran from September 2011 to March 2012 were evaluated. The Children were randomly assigned into two groups to receive orally 0.3 mg/kg melatonin or 0.75 mg/kg ampoule of midazolam. The primary outcome was efficacy in adequate sedation (Ramsay sedation score of four) and recording of EEG. Secondary outcome was clinical side effects.

Monitoring depth of anesthesia is a fundamental solution to this problem. The induction of anesthesia alters frequency and mean of amplitudes of the electroencephalogram (EEG), and its phase couplings. We analyzed EEG changes for phase coupling between delta and alpha subbands using a new algorithm for depth of general anesthesia measurement based on complex wavelet transform (CWT) in patients anesthetized by Propofol. Entropy and histogram of modulated signals were calculated by taking bispectral index (BIS) values as reference. Entropies corresponding to different BIS intervals using Mann-Whitney U test showed that they had different continuous distributions. The results demonstrated that there is a phase coupling between 3 and 4 Hz in delta and 8-9 Hz in alpha subbands and these changes are shown better at the channel T 7 of EEG. Moreover, when BIS values increase, the entropy value of modulated signal also increases and vice versa. In addition, measuring phase coupling between delta and alpha subbands of EEG signals through continuous CWT analysis reveals the depth of anesthesia level. As a result, awareness during anesthesia can be prevented.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25276220/

A principled analysis of the SOP can serve as a foundation for answering questions of fundamental importance in basic neuroscience and sleep medicine. Unfortunately, current methods for analyzing the SOP fail to account for the overwhelming evidence that the wake/sleep transition is governed by continuous, dynamic physiological processes. Instead, current practices coarsely discretize sleep both in terms of state, where it is viewed as a binary (wake or sleep) process, and in time, where it is viewed as a single time point derived from subjectively scored stages in 30-second epochs, effectively eliminating SOP dynamics from the analysis. These methods also fail to integrate information from both behavioral and physiological data. It is thus imperative to resolve the mismatch between the physiological evidence and analysis methodologies. In this paper, we develop a statistically and physiologically principled dynamic framework and empirical SOP model, combining simultaneously-recorded physiological measurements with behavioral data from a novel breathing task requiring no arousing external sensory stimuli. We fit the model using data from healthy subjects, and estimate the instantaneous probability that a subject is awake during the SOP. The model successfully tracked physiological and behavioral dynamics for individual nights, and significantly outperformed the instantaneous transition models implicit in clinical definitions of sleep onset. Our framework also provides a principled means for cross-subject data alignment as a function of wake probability, allowing us to characterize and compare SOP dynamics across different populations. This analysis enabled us to quantitatively compare the EEG of subjects showing reduced alpha power with the remaining subjects at identical response probabilities. Thus, by incorporating both physiological and behavioral dynamics into our model framework, the dynamics of our analyses can finally match those observed during the SOP.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25275376/

This is despite the obvious asymmetry in the initiation and termination of natural sleep. In order to characterize the restoration of consciousness after surgery, we recorded frontal electroencephalograph (EEG) from 100 patients in the operating room during maintenance and emergence from general anesthesia. We have defined, for the first time, 4 steady-state patterns of anesthetic maintenance based on the relative EEG power in the slow-wave (<14 Hz) frequency bands that dominate sleep and anesthesia. Unlike single-drug experiments performed in healthy volunteers, we found that surgical patients exhibited greater electroencephalographic heterogeneity while re-establishing conscious awareness after drug discontinuation. Moreover, these emergence patterns could be broadly grouped according to the duration and rapidity of transitions amongst these slow-wave dominated brain states that precede awakening. Most patients progressed gradually from a pattern characterized by strong peaks of delta (0.5-4 Hz) and alpha/spindle (8-14 Hz) power ('Slow-Wave Anesthesia') to a state marked by low delta-spindle power ('Non Slow-Wave Anesthesia') before awakening. However, 31% of patients transitioned abruptly from Slow-Wave Anesthesia to waking; they were also more likely to express pain in the post-operative period. Our results, based on sleep-staging classification, provide the first systematized nomenclature for tracking brain states under general anesthesia from maintenance to emergence, and suggest that these transitions may correlate with post-operative outcomes such as pain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25264892/

Furthermore, the modulatory role of brainstem transmitters, the function of cortical inhibition and the relative contribution of single neocortical neurons to EEG slow waves have started to be carefully investigated. Together, these new data confirm the view that a full understanding of slow waves can only be achieved by considering the thalamocortical network as a single functional and dynamic unit for the generation of this key EEG rhythm.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25233254/

Time-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to experimental tactile stimuli, experimental noxious stimuli, and clinically required cannulation were examined in 51 children (ages 1-12 years) under sevoflurane monoanaesthesia. Based on a pilot study (n=12), we hypothesised that noxious stimulation in children receiving sevoflurane monoanaesthesia would evoke an increase in delta activity. This was tested in an independent sample of children (n=39), where a subset (n=11) had topical local anaesthetic applied prior to stimulation. A novel method of time-locking the stimuli to the EEG recording was developed using an event detection interface and high-speed camera. Clinical cannulation evoked a significant increase (34.2 ± 8.3%) in delta activity (P=0.042), without concomitant changes in heart rate or reflex withdrawal, which was not observed when local anaesthetic was applied (P=0.30). Experimental tactile (P=0.012) and noxious (P=0.0099) stimulation also evoked significant increases in delta activity, but the magnitude of the response was graded with stimulus intensity, with the greatest increase evoked by cannulation. We demonstrate that experimental and clinically essential noxious procedures, undertaken in anaesthetised children, alter the pattern of EEG activity, that this response can be inhibited by local anaesthetic, and that this measure is more sensitive than other physiological indicators of nociception. This technique provides the possibility that sensitivity to noxious stimuli during anaesthesia could be investigated in other clinical populations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25218826/
25192345,The ethical and clinical importance of measuring consciousness in continuously sedated patients.,The Journal of clinical ethics,2014,"Raus K, de Laat M, Mortier E, Sterckx S","Continuous sedation at the end of life is a practice that has attracted a great deal of attention. An increasing number of guidelines on the proposed correct performance of the practice have been drafted. All of the guidelines stress the importance of using sedation in proportion to the severity of the patient's symptoms, thus to reduce the patient's consciousness no more than is absolutely necessary. As different patients can have different experiences of suffering, the amount of suffering should, ideally, be assessed subjectively; that is, via communication with the patient. Continuously sedated patients are often unable to communicate, however, making subjective methods of pain assessment unusable. For these patients, the degree of consciousness is the sole available measure. It therefore seems important to adequately measure how deeply the patient is sedated, thereby allowing sedation to be increased when it is too light and decreased when it is too heavy. This is in accordance with the idea that reducing consciousness is not an ethically neutral act. Although consciousness measuring techniques are a hot topic in anesthesiology, almost no research exists on the use of such techniques in the context of continuous sedation at the end of life. This article aims to review existing techniques to measure consciousness and to evaluate their applicability, efficiency, and invasiveness for patients who are continuously sedated until death. Techniques commonly used to assess the depth of sedation in continuously sedated patients are basic clinical assessment and sedation scales, as they are often considered reliable and non-invasive. These techniques might not be very reliable, however, since it is known that some patients are nonresponsive and yet aware. Moreover, sedation scales require stimulation of the patient (for example prodding, shaking, or providing painful stimuli), and can thus be considered invasive of one's bodily integrity or dignity. Other techniques, such as EEG (electroencephalography) derivatives, may score better on reliability and invasiveness. Yet these have so far never been compared to sedation scale scores for patients receiving continuous sedation at the end of life. Therefore, we conclude that, for both clinical and ethical reasons, research into the efficiency and applicability of other techniques, such as derivatives of EEG, are urgently needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25192345/

The use of pulsed electrical gradients carries a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, severe muscle contractions, and seizures. We aimed to identify IRE-related risks and the appropriate precautions for anaesthetic management.
All patients who were treated with IRE were prospectively included. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, active coronary artery disease, and epilepsy. All procedures were performed under general anaesthesia with complete muscle relaxation during ECG-synchronized pulsing. Adverse events, cardiovascular effects, blood samples, cerebral activity, and post-procedural pain were analysed.
Twenty-eight patients underwent 30 IRE sessions for tumours in the liver, pancreas, kidney, and lesser pelvis. No major adverse events occurred during IRE. Median systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased by 44 mm Hg (range -7 to 108 mm Hg) and 19 mm Hg (range 1-50 mm Hg), respectively. Two transient minor cardiac arrhythmias without haemodynamic consequences were observed. Muscle contractions were mild and IRE caused no reactive brain activity on a simplified EEG. Pain in the first 24 h after percutaneous IRE was generally mild, but higher pain scores were reported after pancreatic treatment (mean VAS score 3; range 0-9).
Side-effects during IRE on tumours in the liver, pancreas, kidney, and lesser pelvis seem mild and manageable when current recommendations for anaesthesia management, including deep muscle relaxation and ECG synchronized pulsing, are followed. Electrical pulses do not seem to cause reactive cerebral activity and evidence for pre-existing atrial fibrillation as an absolute contra-indication for IRE is questionable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25173767/

We used order patterns cross recurrence plot and provide an index named order pattern laminarity (OPL) to assess changes in neuronal synchronization as the mechanism forming the foundation of conscious perception. The prediction probability of 0.9 and 0.84 for OPL and BIS specified that the OPL index correlated more strongly with effect-site propofol concentration. Also, our new index makes faster reaction to transients in EEG recordings based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model parameters and demonstrates less variability at the point of loss of consciousness (standard deviation of 0.04 for OPL compared with 0.09 for BIS index).

Clinical studies investigating the viability of ASSR under total intravenous anesthesia have not been performed.
During craniotomy under total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil in 20 patients, ASSR were recorded. An additional control patient undergoing cerebellopontine angle surgery was included, in whom the auditory nerve could not be preserved. One-minute sinus tones (500, 1,000, 2,000 Hz) were applied with 60-, 70-, and 80-decibel hearing level. Stimuli were amplitude modulated with 40, 90, or 110 Hz and applied monaurally to the left and right ears. Time to detect a significant response and response amplitudes at 40, 90, or 110 Hz in the evoked EEG spectra was evaluated.
Overall, 90-Hz ASSR were successfully detected in all 20 patients, 110 Hz in 18 patients, and 40 Hz in 14 patients after a median of 10 seconds. No ASSR could be detected in the control patient at the end of the surgical procedure. Time-to-significance and ASSR amplitudes were influenced by stimulus intensity, carrier, and modulation frequency (Scheirer-Ray-Hare test, P < 0.005). Ipsilateral responses were higher than contralateral (P < 0.0001).
In conclusion, 90- and 110-Hz ASSR can be reliably detected under total intravenous anesthesia. Our results are in line with those from previous studies in awake patients. Auditory steady-state response during anesthesia may enable intraoperative frequency-specific audiometry and monitoring of the auditory nerve.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25083846/

In this study, we propose a method based on permutation cross-mutual information (PCMI) to investigate whether or not the coupling between EEG series can be used to quantify the effect of specific anesthetic drugs (isoflurane and remifentanil) on brain activities.
A Rössler-Lorenz system and surrogate analysis was first employed to compare histogram-based mutual information (HMI) and PCMI for estimating the coupling of two nonlinear systems. Then, the HMI and the PCMI indices of EEG recordings from two sides of the forehead of 12 patients undergoing combined remifentanil and isoflurane anesthesia were demonstrated for tracking the effect of drug on the coupling of brain activities. Performance of all indices was assessed by the correlation coefficients (Rij) and relative coefficient of variation (CV).
The PCMI can track the coupling strength of two nonlinear systems, and it is sensitive to the phase change of the coupling systems. Compared to the HMI, the PCMI has a better correlation with the coupling strength in nonlinear systems. The PCMI could track the effect of anesthesia and distinguish the consciousness state from the unconsciousness state. Moreover, at the embedding dimension m=4 and lag τ=1, the PCMI had a better performance than HMI in tracking the effect of anesthesia drugs on brain activities.
As a measure of coupling, the PCMI was able to reflect the state of consciousness from two EEG recordings.
The PCMI is a promising new coupling measure for estimating the effect of isoflurane and remifentanil anesthetic drugs on the brain activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24997872/

Both indices are derived from the frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) and implemented in the qCON 2000 monitor (Quantium Medical, Barcelona, Spain).
The study was approved by the local ethics committee, including data from 60 patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery undergoing general anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil, using TCI. The Bis (Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA) was recorded simultaneously with the qCON. Loss of eyelash reflex [loss of consciousness (LOC)] was recorded, and prediction probability for Bis and qCON was calculated. Movement as a response to noxious stimulation [laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation] was registered. The correlation coefficient between qCON and Bis was calculated. The patients were divided into movers/non-movers as a response to noxious stimulation. A paired t-test was used to assess significant difference for qCON and qNOX for movers/non-movers.
The prediction probability (Pk) and the standard error (SE) for qCON and Bis for detecting LOC was 0.92 (0.02) and 0.94 (0.02) respectively (t-test, no significant difference). The R between qCON and Bis was 0.85. During the general anaesthesia (Ce propofol > 2 μg/ml, Ce remifentanil > 2 ng/ml), the mean value and standard deviation (SD) for qCON was 45 (8), while for qNOX it was 40 (6). The qNOX pre-stimuli values were significantly different (P < 0.05) for movers/non-movers as a response to LMA insertion [62.5 (24.0) vs. 45.5 (24.1)], tracheal intubation [58.7 (21.8) vs. 41.4 (20.9)], laryngoscopy [54.1 (21.4) vs. 41.0 (20.8)]. There were no significant differences in remifentanil or propofol effect-site concentrations for movers vs. non-movers.
The qCON was able to reliably detect LOC during general anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. The qNOX showed significant overlap between movers and non-movers, but it was able to predict whether or not the patient would move as a response to noxious stimulation, although the anaesthetic concentrations were similar.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24995461/

Quantification of the Poincaré plot is a candidate for estimating anesthesia-dependent changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG).
In 20 patients, at four different states of anesthesia (0.5%, 1%, 2% and 3% sevoflurane), frontal EEG signals (10s) were used to construct Poincaré plots. The plot pattern was quantified by the standard deviation of the voltage dispersion along the line of identity (SD2), the standard deviation perpendicular to the line of identity (SD1) and their ratio (SD1/SD2), and compared using spectral EEG features.
A significant stepwise decrease in the SD1/SD2 ratio was observed with each stepwise increase in sevoflurane concentration (p<0.001 for each). From 0.5% to 3% sevoflurane anesthesia, the ratio of relative β power to δ power (β/δ) was highly correlated with SD1/SD2 (R=0.92).
The Poincaré plot of the frontal EEG can detect the significant changes in the depth of anesthesia induced by different sevoflurane concentrations.

Despite these advances, recording a technically acceptable EEG in an electrically hostile environment such as the emergency department (ED) remains a challenge, particularly with infants or young children. In 1996, a meeting of French experts established a set of guidelines for performing an EEG in the ED based on a review of the available literature. The authors highlighted the most suitable indications for an emergency EEG including clinical suspicion of cerebral death, convulsive and myoclonic status epilepticus, focal or generalized relapsing convulsive seizures as well as follow-up of known convulsive patients. They further recommended emergency EEG in the presence of doubt regarding the epileptic nature of the presentation as well as during the initiation or modification of sedation following brain injury. Subsequently, proposals for expanding the use of EEG in emergency patients have been advocated including trauma, vascular and anoxic-ischemic injury due to cardiorespiratory arrest, postinfective encephalopathy and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The aim of this review is to show the diagnostic importance of video-EEG, as well as highlighting the predictive prognostic factors for positive and negative outcomes, when utilized in the pediatric ED for seizures as well as other neurological presentations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24917085/

We studied the performance of limited coverage EEG compared with more traditional full-montage EEG.
Continuous EEG recordings were performed on 170 patients using the full-montage 10-20 placement of electrodes as a reference recording and an abbreviated montage of electrodes applied below the hairline (subhairline). Recordings were reviewed independently, with the identity of the patients concealed.
Seizures were found in 8% of patients. Sensitivity for detecting patients with seizures using the subhairline system was 0.54 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.29-0.77] with specificity of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.97-1.00) and positive predictive value of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.65-1.00). For detecting interictal epileptiform activity, we found sensitivity to be 0.60 (95% CI, 0.46-0.74), specificity to be 0.94 (95% CI, 0.88-0.97), and positive predictive value to be 0.81 (95% CI, 0.65-0.91). Performance was poor for triphasic waves, alpha/theta/spindle coma, and suppression.

It is important to detect burst suppression reliably during the administration of anesthetic or sedative agents, especially for cerebral-protective treatments in various neurosurgical diseases. This study investigates recurrent plot (RP) analysis for the detection of the burst suppression pattern (BSP) in EEG. The RP analysis is applied to EEG data containing BSPs collected from 14 patients. Firstly we obtain the best selection of parameters for RP analysis. Then, the recurrence rate (RR), determinism (DET), and entropy (ENTR) are calculated. Then RR was selected as the best BSP index one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparison tests. Finally, the performance of RR analysis is compared with spectral analysis, bispectral analysis, approximate entropy, and the nonlinear energy operator (NLEO). ANOVA and multiple comparison tests showed that the RR could detect BSP and that it was superior to other measures with the highest sensitivity of suppression detection (96.49%, P = 0.03). Tracking BSP patterns is essential for clinical monitoring in critically ill and anesthetized patients. The purposed RR may provide an effective burst suppression detector for developing new patient monitoring systems.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24883378/

This study investigated whether intraoperative EEG suppression was an independent predictor of 90 day postoperative mortality and explored risk factors for EEG suppression.
This observational study included 2662 adults enrolled in the B-Unaware or BAG-RECALL trials. A cohort was defined with >5 cumulative minutes of EEG suppression, and 1:2 propensity-matched to a non-suppressed cohort (≤5 min suppression). We evaluated the association between EEG suppression and mortality using multivariable logistic regression, and examined risk factors for EEG suppression using zero-inflated mixed effects analysis.
Ninety day postoperative mortality was 3.9% overall, 6.3% in the suppressed cohort, and 3.0% in the non-suppressed cohort {odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]=2.19 (1.48-3.26)}. After matching and multivariable adjustment, EEG suppression was not associated with mortality [OR (95% CI)=0.83 (0.55-1.25)]; however, the interaction between EEG suppression and mean arterial pressure (MAP) <55 mm Hg was [OR (95% CI)=2.96 (1.34-6.52)]. Risk factors for EEG suppression were older age, number of comorbidities, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and higher intraoperative doses of benzodiazepines, opioids, or volatile anaesthetics. EEG suppression was less likely in patients with cancer, preoperative alcohol, opioid or benzodiazepine consumption, and intraoperative nitrous oxide exposure.
Although EEG suppression was associated with increasing anaesthetic administration and comorbidities, the hypothesis that intraoperative EEG suppression is a predictor of postoperative mortality was only supported if it was coincident with low MAP.

Chloral hydrate (CH) is typically used for this sedation, and dexmedetomidine (DEX) was recently tested because preliminary data suggest that this drug does not affect the electroencephalogram (EEG). The aim of the present study was to compare the EEG pattern during DEX or CH sedation to test the hypothesis that both drugs exert similar effects on the EEG.
A total of 17 patients underwent 2 EEGs on 2 separate occasions, one with DEX and the other with CH. The EEG qualitative variables included the phases of sleep and the background activity. The EEG quantitative analysis was performed during the first 2 minutes of the second stage of sleep. The EEG quantitative variables included density, duration, and amplitude of the sleep spindles and absolute spectral power.
The results showed that the qualitative analysis, density, duration, and amplitude of sleep spindles did not differ between DEX and CH sedation. The power of the slow-frequency bands (δ and θ) was higher with DEX, but the power of the faster-frequency bands (α and β) was higher with CH. The total power was lower with DEX than with CH.
The differences of DEX and CH in EEG power did not change the EEG qualitative interpretation, which was similar with the 2 drugs. Other studies comparing natural sleep and sleep induced by these drugs are needed to clarify the clinical relevance of the observed EEG quantitative differences.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24823763/

In experimental models, breathing xenon gas during cooling offers long-term additive neuroprotection. This is the first xenon feasibility study in cooled infants. Xenon is expensive, requiring a closed-circuit delivery system.
Cooled newborns with neonatal encephalopathy were eligible for this single-arm, dose-escalation study if clinically stable, under 18 hours of age and requiring less than 35% oxygen. Xenon duration increased stepwise from 3 to 18 hours in 14 subjects; 1 received 25% xenon and 13 received 50%.

We prospectively studied over a 1-year period (June 2012-June 2013) 50 consecutive comatose CA patients treated with TH (33 °C, 24 h). Quantitative PLR (expressed as the % of pupillary response to a calibrated light stimulus) and standard PLR were measured at day 1 (TH and sedation; on average 16 h after CA) and day 2 (normothermia, off sedation: on average 46 h after CA). Neurological outcome was assessed at 90 days with Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC), dichotomized as good (CPC 1-2) versus poor (CPC 3-5). Predictive performance was analyzed using area under the ROC curves (AUC).
Patients with good outcome [n = 23 (46 %)] had higher quantitative PLR than those with poor outcome [n = 27; 16 (range 9-23) vs. 10 (1-30) % at day 1, and 20 (13-39) vs. 11 (1-55) % at day 2, both p < 0.001].

We investigated this reactivity by studying the effect of peripheral nerve stimulation used for routine intraoperative spinal cord monitoring by somatosensory evoked potentials on BS patterns.
The relative time spent in suppression expressed as BS ratio (BSR) and mean burst duration were measured before (BSR(Pre)), during (BSR(Stim)), and after (BSR(Post)) a 60-second repetitive electrical ulnar nerve stimulation in nine patients under total intravenous general anesthesia with propofol. The BS reactivity was measured as BSR(Pre)-BSR(Stim).
Overall, 27 trials were included with BSR(Pre) up to 77%, indistinguishable from BSR(Post). During stimulation, the mean BSR transiently decreased from 42% to 35%. For each 1% increase in BSR(Pre), the BS reactivity increased with 0.6%, whereas the burst duration remained approximately 3 seconds. For BSR(Pre) below 30%, the BS reactivity was negligible.

The recently introduced method of Spatial Analytic Phase Difference (SAPD) was used to measure changes in synchrony in the electroencephalogram (EEG) activity of 29 patients undergoing routine surgery. Analysis was performed over 9 frequency bands: (i) δ (1.5-3.5Hz); (ii) θ (3.5-7.5Hz); (iii) α1 (8-10Hz); (iv) α2 (10.5-12Hz); (v) β1 (12.5-18Hz); (vi) β2 (18.5-21Hz); (vii) β3 (21.5-30Hz); (viii) γ1 (30.5-40Hz); and (ix) γ2 (60-80Hz).
Anesthesia was characterized by (a) large and localized synchrony increases in mid-frequency bands (8-12Hz), (b) smaller and widespread synchrony increases in higher frequency bands (30.5-40Hz, 60-80Hz), and (c) both increase and decrease of synchrony in low frequency bands (1.5-7.5Hz).
This study supports anesthetic-induced changes in synchrony, with the inducement of persistent and reversible widespread γ synchrony being most prominent.

Neurology,2014,"Greer DM, Rosenthal ES, Wu O","Neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest has always been challenging, and has become even more so since the advent of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) in the early 2000s. Studies in this field are prone to substantial biases--most importantly, the self-fulfilling prophecy of early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies--and physicians must be aware of these limitations when evaluating individual patients. TH mandates sedation and prolongs drug metabolism, and delayed neuronal recovery is possible after cardiac arrest with or without hypothermia treatment; thus, the clinician must allow an adequate observation period to assess for delayed recovery. Exciting advances have been made in clinical evaluation, electrophysiology, chemical biomarkers and neuroimaging, providing insights into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of injury, as well as prognosis. Some clinical features, such as pupillary reactivity, continue to provide robust information about prognosis, and EEG patterns, such as reactivity and continuity, seem promising as prognostic indicators. Evoked potential information is likely to remain a reliable prognostic tool in TH-treated patients, whereas traditional serum biomarkers, such as neuron-specific enolase, may be less reliable. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, particularly those utilizing MRI, hold great promise for the future.

About 75% of responders considered general anesthesia as a preferable technique for CA, and about 89% of responders provided it in real life, independent of subspecialty training. The most preferable intraoperative neuromonitoring was cerebral oximetry (28%), followed by EEG (24%), and having an awake patient (23%). Neuroprotection was not considered by 33% of responders, and upon conclusion of a case, 59% preferred an awake patient for extubation, while 15% preferred a deep extubation.

Our objective was to evaluate the rate of detection and prevention of neurologic events by multinerve SEP, MEP, and EEG in patients undergoing CEA while under general anesthesia.
A prospective study of 181 consecutive patients undergoing CEA between June 2005 and September 2010 was reviewed. Intraoperative changes, including a 50% reduction in the amplitude of SEP waveforms, loss of MEP, and/or a 50% change in EEG frequency were noted as indications for shunting. This was correlated with the actual use of intraoperative shunting and postoperative neurologic sequelae at both 24 hours and 30 days. Median and tibial nerve SEPs and MEPs were also correlated.
Eleven patients (6%) experienced intraoperative monitoring changes (SEP: 11/11; MEP: 6/11). Five of 11 patients with MEP/SEP changes underwent shunting, while the other 6 had normalization with the elevation of their blood pressure. Of the 11 patients that had neurophysiologic changes, 54% (6/11) were patients with symptomatic disease. No patients had significant EEG changes. The total shunt rate was 2.7% (5/181). No postoperative neurologic sequelae were noted.
The ratio of shunting at 2.7% is equal to the lowest rates reported in the awake patient literature. Interestingly, the predicted synergy of multimodality monitoring cannot be directly attributed to an increased specificity resulting from the addition of SEP and MEP to EEG, because no patients had EEG changes. In addition, in today's cost-conscious world of health care, our results do not justify implementing this particular technique of neuromonitoring across the board-but it is apparent that the combination of these 3 modalities is both safe and effective with potential applications in symptomatic patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24495327/

Propofol is one of the most widely used and the most widely studied anesthetics. When administered for general anesthesia or sedation, the electroencephalogram (EEG) under propofol shows highly structured, rhythmic activity that is strongly associated with changes in the patient's level of arousal. These highly structured oscillations lend themselves readily to mathematical descriptions using dynamical systems models. We review recent model descriptions of the commonly observed EEG patterns associated with propofol: paradoxical excitation, strong frontal alpha oscillations, anteriorization and burst suppression. Our analysis suggests that propofol's actions at GABAergic networks in the cortex, thalamus and brainstem induce profound brain dynamics that are one of the likely mechanisms through which this anesthetic induces altered arousal states from sedation to unconsciousness. Because these dynamical effects are readily observed in the EEG, the mathematical descriptions of how propofol's EEG signatures relate to its mechanisms of action in neural circuits provide anesthesiologists with a neurophysiologically based approach to monitoring the brain states of patients receiving anesthesia care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24457211/

Automated EEG analysis may help quantify the brain damage. Forty-six comatose patients in therapeutic hypothermia, after cardiac arrest, were included in the study. EEG background was quantified with burst-suppression ratio (BSR) and approximate entropy, both used to monitor anesthesia. Reactivity was detected through change in the power spectrum of signal before and after stimulation. Automatic results obtained almost perfect agreement (discontinuity) to substantial agreement (background reactivity) with a visual score from EEG-certified neurologists. Burst-suppression ratio was more suited to distinguish continuous EEG background from burst-suppression than approximate entropy in this specific population. Automatic EEG background and reactivity measures were significantly related to good and poor outcome. We conclude that quantitative EEG measurements can provide promising information regarding current state of the patient and clinical outcome, but further work is needed before routine application in a clinical setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24452769/

There is, however, limited information on the time course of these changes. We recently obtained intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from the ventroposterolateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus and from the motor cortex during induction of anesthesia in three patients to study the time course of the alterations of cortical and thalamic function.
The patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II males aged 33-57 yr with intractable central pain caused by brachial plexus injury (patient 1 and 2) or insular infarct (patient 3). Anesthesia was induced with propofol (2.5-3.1 mg·kg(-1) over 30-45 sec) followed, after loss of consciousness, by rocuronium for tracheal intubation. The data retained for analysis are from one minute before the start of propofol to 110 sec later during ventilation of the patients' lungs before tracheal intubation. Spectral analysis was used to measure absolute EEG power. Propofol caused significant increases of cortical and thalamic power in the delta to beta frequency bands (1-30 Hz). These increases of cortical and thalamic power occurred either concomitantly or within seconds of each other. Propofol also caused a decrease in cortical and thalamic high-gamma (62-200 Hz) power that also followed a similar time course.
We conclude that induction of anesthesia with propofol in these patients was associated with concurrent alterations of cortical and sensory thalamic activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24449402/

Cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling is a prominent feature of cortical oscillations, but its role in organizing conscious and unconscious brain states is poorly understood. Using high-density EEG and intracranial electrocorticography during gradual induction of propofol general anesthesia in humans, we discovered a rapid drug-induced transition between distinct states with opposite phase-amplitude coupling and different cortical source distributions. One state occurs during unconsciousness and may be similar to sleep slow oscillations. A second state occurs at the loss or recovery of consciousness and resembles an enhanced slow cortical potential. These results provide objective electrophysiological landmarks of distinct unconscious brain states, and could be used to help improve EEG-based monitoring for general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24431442/

Historically, clinicians and researchers have always been interested in quantifying and characterizing those effects through recordings of surface brain electrical activity, namely electroencephalography (EEG). Over decades of research, the complex signal has been dissected to extract its core substance, with significant advances in the interpretation of the information it may contain. Methodological, engineering, statistical, mathematical, and computer progress now furnishes advanced tools that not only allow quantification of the effects of anesthesia, but also shed light on some aspects of anesthetic mechanisms. In this article, we will review how advanced EEG serves the anesthesiologist in that respect, but will not review other intraoperative utilities that have no direct relationship with consciousness, such as monitoring of brain and spinal cord integrity. We will start with a reminder of anesthestic effects on raw EEG and its time and frequency domain components, as well as a summary of the EEG analysis techniques of use for the anesthesiologist. This will introduce the description of the use of EEG to assess the depth of the hypnotic and anti-nociceptive components of anesthesia, and its clinical utility. The last part will describe the use of EEG for the understanding of mechanisms of anesthesia-induced alteration of consciousness. We will see how, eventually in association with transcranial magnetic stimulation, it allows exploring functional cerebral networks during anesthesia. We will also see how EEG recordings during anesthesia, and their sophisticated analysis, may help corroborate current theories of mental content generation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24415399/

Recent research has found that multi-scale EEG analysis describes brain dynamics better than traditional non-linear methods. In this study, we have adopted a modified sample entropy (MSpEn) method to analyze anesthetic EEG series as a measure of DoA. EEG data from a previous study consisting of 19 adult subjects undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia were used in the present investigation. In addition to the modified sample entropy method, the well-established EEG indices approximate entropy (ApEn), response entropy (RE), and state entropy (SE) were also computed for comparison. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and prediction probability (P k ) were used to assess and compare the performance of the four methods for tracking anesthetic concentration. The influence of the number of scales on MSpEn was also investigated using a linear regression model. MSpEn correlated closely with anesthetic effect. The P k (0.83 ± 0.05, mean ± SD) and the coefficient of determination R (2) (0.87 ± 0.21) for the relationship between MSpEn and sevoflurane effect site concentration were highest for MSpEn (P k : RE = 0.73 ± 0.08, SE = 0.72 ± 0.07, ApEn = 0.81 ± 0.04; R (2): RE = 0.75 ± 0.08, SE = 0.64 ± 0.09, ApEn = 0.81 ± 0.10). Scales 1, 3 and 5 tended to make the greatest contribution to MSpEn. For this data set, the MSpEn is superior to the ApEn, the RE and the SE for tracking drug concentration change during sevoflurane anesthesia. It is suggested that the MSpEn may be further studied for application in clinical monitoring of DoA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24414381/

The usefulness of bispectral index (BIS) in monitoring human anesthesia is well established. However, the validity of its application remains unproven in laboratory animals. We assessed whether BIS could be used reliably in monitoring the depth of deep anesthesia in 8 New Zealand white rabbits. Experimental baseline anesthesia was maintained with continuous infusion of propofol and administration of isoflurane, both of which were titrated to EEG activity. The rabbits were allocated randomly to receive 3 increasing concentrations of common anesthetic drugs (etomidate, propofol, and isoflurane) aimed to produce burst suppression of EEG activity yielding at least 10 s of sustained EEG silence. Rabbits had a 20-min recovery interval between challenges. Transient cerebral hypoperfusion to produce reversible EEG silence due to ischemia was induced as a fourth challenge, followed by terminal arrest, in each animal. BIS, EEG, and physiologic data were analyzed for each rabbit. We observed stable BIS values in the range of 40 to 60 during the administration of baseline anesthesia. However, as the depth of anesthesia deepened with the anesthetic drug challenges, the BIS value paradoxically increased with increasing doses. The BIS signal quality index declined while the total power decreased. In contrast to these unexpected results, BIS values decreased rapidly to near 0 during terminal arrest, as expected. Therefore, we do not consider BIS to be a useful method for monitoring deep levels of anesthesia in laboratory rabbits.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24411783/

Usually, if we observe purposeful behavior, appropriate responses to sensory inputs, and, above all, appropriate answers to questions, we can be reasonably sure that the person is conscious. However, we know that consciousness can be entirely within the brain, even in the absence of any interaction with the external world; this happens almost every night, while we dream. Yet, to this day, we lack an objective, dependable measure of the level of consciousness that is independent of processing sensory inputs and producing appropriate motor outputs. Theoretically, consciousness is thought to require the joint presence of functional integration and functional differentiation, otherwise defined as brain complexity. Here we review a series of recent studies in which Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS/EEG) has been employed to quantify brain complexity in wakefulness and during physiological (sleep), pharmacological (anesthesia) and pathological (brain injury) loss of consciousness. These studies invariably show that the complexity of the cortical response to TMS collapses when consciousness is lost during deep sleep, anesthesia and vegetative state following severe brain injury, while it recovers when consciousness resurges in wakefulness, during dreaming, in the minimally conscious state or locked-in syndrome. The present paper will also focus on how this approach may contribute to unveiling the pathophysiology of disorders of consciousness affecting brain-injured patients. Finally, we will underline some crucial methodological aspects concerning TMS/EEG measurements of brain complexity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24403317/

Following muscular paralysis with succinylcholine and hypnosis, bitemporal ECT was applied. Vital signs, depth of sedation, recovery parameters, motor and electroencephalography (EEG) convulsion activity and postictal suppression index scores were recorded.
A total of 120 sessions of ECT were administered to 12 patients. Heart rate was higher in the sevoflurane group than the propofol group. Compared with the sevoflurane group, bispectral index level was lower in the propofol group during the induction period and higher during the recovery period. Anaesthetic induction and recovery times were lower, and average motor and EEG convulsion activity was longer, in the propofol group than in the sevoflurane group.

Other means of evaluation are needed to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis in this challenging population. We will here review the different altered states of consciousness occurring after severe brain damage, and explain the difficulties associated with behavioral assessment of consciousness. We will then describe a non-invasive technique, transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with high-density electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), which has allowed us to detect the presence or absence of consciousness in different physiological, pathological and pharmacological states.

Identification of genes contributing to EEG variability during anaesthesia is important to the clinical application of anaesthesia monitoring and may provide an avenue to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the generation and regulation of brain oscillations. Central immune signalling can impact neuronal activity in the brain and accumulating evidence suggests an important role for cytokines as neuronal modulators. We tested 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune-related genes for associations with three anaesthesia-induced EEG patterns; spindle amplitude, delta power and alpha power, during general anaesthesia with desflurane in 111 patients undergoing general, gynaecological or orthopaedic surgery.

This study aimed to identify EEG characteristics that might warn of awakening (AW) from sevoflurane anaesthesia in infants.
Twenty intubated infants [aged 39-77 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA)] were studied after surgery during sevoflurane wash-out. EEG was recorded at the end of surgery and throughout emergence. Changes in EEG time and frequency domains were described.
At the end of surgery, mean end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was 2.3% (range 1.5-3.5) before wash-out and reduced to 0.3% (0.1-0.6) when AW began. On AW, movement artifacts made signals difficult to interpret. Before awakening, most power was within frequencies ≤4 Hz, but trends over time were variable. Summated power in frequencies between 20 and 70 Hz was almost always <5 µV(2).

In three diverse patients with known zolpidem responses we identify a distinctive pattern of EEG dynamics that suggests a mechanistic model. In the absence of zolpidem, all subjects show a strong low frequency oscillatory peak ∼6-10 Hz in the EEG power spectrum most prominent over frontocentral regions and with high coherence (∼0.7-0.8) within and between hemispheres. Zolpidem administration sharply reduces EEG power and coherence at these low frequencies. The ∼6-10 Hz activity is proposed to arise from intrinsic membrane properties of pyramidal neurons that are passively entrained across the cortex by locally-generated spontaneous activity. Activation by zolpidem is proposed to arise from a combination of initial direct drug effects on cortical, striatal, and thalamic populations and further activation of underactive brain regions induced by restoration of cognitively-mediated behaviors.

The EEG obtained during routine surgery in 29 patients was analysed with GFS over the following frequency bands: δ (1.5-3.5 Hz), θ (3.5-7.5 Hz), α1 (8-10 Hz), α2 (10.5-12 Hz), β1 (12.5-18 Hz), β2 (18.5-21 Hz), β3 (21.5-30 Hz), γ1 (30.5-40 Hz), and γ2 (60-80 Hz). In addition, localized GFS estimations over aggregate brain areas were performed. GFS was estimated over 2 s non-overlapping windows. The differences in GFS values between 'wakefulness' and 'anaesthesia' were assessed with the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (α=0.05).
Anaesthetic administration caused significant GFS changes in all frequency ranges and electrode combinations studied: (i) widespread synchrony increased in the α2 and β1 ranges and decreased in all other ranges, with the exception of α1 and β2, where no specific pattern was identified; and (ii) localized synchrony decreased in all areas in the δ and γ2 ranges, while location-specific changes were observed in the remaining frequency ranges. The most consistent findings were statistically significant decreases over all areas in the γ2 range, with GFS decrease over the central-right temporal being the most consistent change.
Significant frequency- and location-dependent changes in GFS were induced by anaesthetic administration, with more robust changes identified in the γ range. GFS can act as an aid for further and more detailed analysis regarding the particular combinations of frequency ranges and spatial locations that are most informative for the study of anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24169819/

Under hyperpolarizing influences such as anesthetic drugs, cortical neurons oscillate at ~1 Hz, which is measurable as slow waves in the electroencephalogram (EEG). We have administered propofol anesthesia to 16 subjects and found that, after they had lost behavioral responsiveness (response to standard sensory stimuli), each individual's EEG slow-wave activity (SWA) rose to saturation and then remained constant despite increasing drug concentrations. We then simultaneously collected functional magnetic resonance imaging and EEG data in 12 of these subjects during propofol administration and sensory stimulation. During the transition to SWA saturation, the thalamocortical system became isolated from sensory stimuli, whereas internal thalamocortical exchange persisted. Rather, an alternative and more fundamental cortical network (which includes the precuneus) responded to all sensory stimulation. We conclude that SWA saturation is a potential individualized indicator of perception loss that could prove useful for monitoring depth of anesthesia and studying altered states of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24154602/
24142410,Neural correlates of successful semantic processing during propofol sedation.,Human brain mapping,2014,"Adapa RM, Davis MH, Stamatakis EA, Absalom AR, Menon DK","Sedation has a graded effect on brain responses to auditory stimuli: perceptual processing persists at sedation levels that attenuate more complex processing. We used fMRI in healthy volunteers sedated with propofol to assess changes in neural responses to spoken stimuli. Volunteers were scanned awake, sedated, and during recovery, while making perceptual or semantic decisions about nonspeech sounds or spoken words respectively. Sedation caused increased error rates and response times, and differentially affected responses to words in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and the left inferior temporal gyrus (LITG). Activity in LIFG regions putatively associated with semantic processing, was significantly reduced by sedation despite sedated volunteers continuing to make accurate semantic decisions. Instead, LITG activity was preserved for words greater than nonspeech sounds and may therefore be associated with persistent semantic processing during the deepest levels of sedation. These results suggest functionally distinct contributions of frontal and temporal regions to semantic decision making. These results have implications for functional imaging studies of language, for understanding mechanisms of impaired speech comprehension in postoperative patients with residual levels of anesthetic, and may contribute to the development of frameworks against which EEG based monitors could be calibrated to detect awareness under anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24142410/

However, it is seldom used in youth with early onset schizophrenia (EOS) largely because of lack of clarity about its risk benefit ratio. This review synthesises and evaluates available evidence regarding the efficacy and tolerability of CLZ in EOS with the aim to assist clinical decision-making.
We conducted a systematic review of the primary literature on the clinical efficacy and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) observed during CLZ treatment in EOS. We also identified relevant practice guidelines and summarised current guidance.
CLZ showed superior efficacy than other antipsychotics in treating refractory EOS patients; short-term clinical trials suggest an average improvement of 69% on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale that was sustained during long-term follow-up (up to 9 years). No fatalities linked to CLZ treatment were reported. Sedation and hypersalivation were the most common complaints, reported by over 90% of patients. Other common ADRs (reported in 10-60% of patients) were enuresis, constipation, weight gain, and non-specific EEG changes. Less common ADRs (reported in 10-30% of patients) were akathisia, tachycardia and changes in blood pressure. Neutropenia was reported in 6-15% of cases but was usually transient while agranulocytosis was rare (<0.1%). Seizures were also uncommon (<3%). Metabolic changes were relatively common (8-22%) but emergent diabetes was not frequently observed (<6%). Overall the rate of discontinuation was low (3-6%). Current guidelines recommend the use of CLZ in EOS patients who have failed to respond to two adequate trials with different antipsychotics and provide detailed schedules of assessments to evaluate and assess potential ADRs both prior to initiation and throughout CLZ treatment.
Available data although limited in terms of number of studies are consistent in demonstrating that CLZ is effective and generally safe in the treatment of refractory EOS provided patients are regularly monitored.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24119631/

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,2013,"Kim TH, Yoon YG, Uhm J, Jeong DW, Yoon SZ, Park SH","In this paper, a cepstral analysis based approach to measuring the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is presented. Cepstral analysis is a signal processing technique widely used especially for speech recognition in order to extract speech information regardless of vocal cord characteristics. The resulting index for the DoA is called index based on cepstral analysis (ICep). The Fisher criterion is engaged to evaluate the performance of indices. All analyses are based on a single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) of 10 human subjects. To validate the proposed technique, ICep is compared with bispectral index (BIS), which is the most commonly used method to estimate the level of consciousness via EEG during general anesthesia. The results show that ICep has high correlation with BIS, and is outstanding in terms of the Fisher criterion and offers faster tracking than BIS in the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24111105/

Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that patients with chronic disorders of consciousness and subjects undergoing general anesthesia present a complex dysfunctionality in the architecture of brain connectivity. At present, the global hallmark of impaired consciousness appears to be a multifaceted dysfunctional connectivity pattern with both within-network loss of connectivity in a widespread frontoparietal network and between-network hyperconnectivity involving other regions such as the insula and ventral tegmental area. Despite ongoing efforts, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of consciousness after severe brain injury are not thoroughly understood. Important questions remain unanswered: What triggers the connectivity impairment leading to disorders of consciousness? Why do some patients recover from coma, while others with apparently similar brain injuries do not? Understanding these mechanisms could lead to a better comprehension of brain function and, hopefully, lead to new therapeutic strategies in this challenging patient population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24100252/
24081351,Chronic disorders of consciousness following coma: Part one: medical issues.,Chest,2013,Luce JM,"Increasing numbers of patients survive traumatic brain injury (TBI) and cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation and are admitted to the ICU in coma. Some of these patients become brain dead; others regain consciousness. Still others become vegetative or minimally conscious, conditions called chronic disorders of consciousness and ultimately are cared for outside the ICU. Comatose patients lack the wakefulness and awareness that distinguish consciousness from unconsciousness. Vegetative patients are awake in that they manifest sleep-wake cycles, but they are unaware of their environment and cannot respond to stimuli. Minimally conscious patients are awake, aware to a limited extent, and somewhat responsive. The diagnosis of the vegetative and minimally conscious states has been based largely on their behavioral and pathologic features, and it has been believed that vegetative patients remain in that condition permanently. Nevertheless, EEG and neuroimaging studies suggest that the traditional diagnostic approach is imprecise. Moreover, clinical investigations have revealed that some vegetative patients can become minimally conscious and that some minimally conscious patients can gain increased awareness. Few therapies for patients with chronic disorders of consciousness have been subjected to randomized trials. Furthermore, although a small number of patients have improved neurologically with or without treatment, their overall prognosis for neurologic recovery remains poor.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24081351/
24058669,Human brain activity patterns beyond the isoelectric line of extreme deep coma.,PloS one,2013,"Kroeger D, Florea B, Amzica F","The electroencephalogram (EEG) reflects brain electrical activity. A flat (isoelectric) EEG, which is usually recorded during very deep coma, is considered to be a turning point between a living brain and a deceased brain. Therefore the isoelectric EEG constitutes, together with evidence of irreversible structural brain damage, one of the criteria for the assessment of brain death. In this study we use EEG recordings for humans on the one hand, and on the other hand double simultaneous intracellular recordings in the cortex and hippocampus, combined with EEG, in cats. They serve to demonstrate that a novel brain phenomenon is observable in both humans and animals during coma that is deeper than the one reflected by the isoelectric EEG, and that this state is characterized by brain activity generated within the hippocampal formation. This new state was induced either by medication applied to postanoxic coma (in human) or by application of high doses of anesthesia (isoflurane in animals) leading to an EEG activity of quasi-rhythmic sharp waves which henceforth we propose to call ν-complexes (Nu-complexes). Using simultaneous intracellular recordings in vivo in the cortex and hippocampus (especially in the CA3 region) we demonstrate that ν-complexes arise in the hippocampus and are subsequently transmitted to the cortex. The genesis of a hippocampal ν-complex depends upon another hippocampal activity, known as ripple activity, which is not overtly detectable at the cortical level. Based on our observations, we propose a scenario of how self-oscillations in hippocampal neurons can lead to a whole brain phenomenon during coma.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24058669/

Source localization methods can be used to estimate spatiotemporal activity from MEG measurements with high temporal resolution, but the spatial resolution of these estimates is poor due to the ill-posed nature of the MEG inverse problem. Recent developments in source localization methodology have emphasized temporal as well as spatial constraints to improve source localization accuracy, but these methods can be computationally intense. Solutions emphasizing spatial sparsity hold tremendous promise, since the underlying neurophysiological processes generating MEG signals are often sparse in nature, whether in the form of focal sources, or distributed sources representing large-scale functional networks. Recent developments in the theory of compressed sensing (CS) provide a rigorous framework to estimate signals with sparse structure. In particular, a class of CS algorithms referred to as greedy pursuit algorithms can provide both high recovery accuracy and low computational complexity. Greedy pursuit algorithms are difficult to apply directly to the MEG inverse problem because of the high-dimensional structure of the MEG source space and the high spatial correlation in MEG measurements. In this paper, we develop a novel greedy pursuit algorithm for sparse MEG source localization that overcomes these fundamental problems. This algorithm, which we refer to as the Subspace Pursuit-based Iterative Greedy Hierarchical (SPIGH) inverse solution, exhibits very low computational complexity while achieving very high localization accuracy. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm using comprehensive simulations, as well as the analysis of human MEG data during spontaneous brain activity and somatosensory stimuli. These studies reveal substantial performance gains provided by the SPIGH algorithm in terms of computational complexity, localization accuracy, and robustness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24055554/

Clinical anaesthesiology,2013,"Friberg H, Cronberg T","The best predictor of good outcome after cardiac arrest is awakening from coma. The longer it takes to regain consciousness, the greater the risk of permanent brain injury. A reliable neurological assessment could previously be performed on day 3 after arrest; absence of or a stereotypic motor reaction to pain and absence of cranial nerve reflexes were reliable predictors of poor outcome, but this has changed. The introduction of therapeutic hypothermia and concurrent sedation and muscle relaxation has affected the reliability of the clinical investigation. This is probably due to increased use of sedative drugs and delayed metabolism during hypothermia but could, in addition, be explained by delayed maturation and recovery processes of brain ischaemia. A clinical neurological assessment should no longer be the sole decisive method for prognostication after cardiac arrest. Instead, a clinical investigation should be used in combination with independent and objective methods, above all neurophysiology (electroencephalography and somatosensory evoked potentials), while biomarkers and brain imaging may be valuable adjuncts.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24054514/

In group A, anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane inspired 8% manually set via the circuit of the Zeus(®) (Dräger Medical, Lübeck, Germany) anesthesia workstation (fresh gas flow 8L.min(-1)) for 2min and then 2.5%. In group B, induction was performed by target-controlled inhalation with a target end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane set at 2.5% (fresh gas flow in auto-control mode).

Assessment of the 'analgesia' component in daily clinical routine is, in contrast to the other components, still based on very unspecific clinical 'end' points such as movement, tearing, tachycardia or hypertension. Individually tailored analgesia, however, should enable to maintain an individual nociceptive-anti-nociceptive balance and better avoid these unwanted responses to surgical stimulation. During the last decade, a variety of monitoring systems were developed in order to assess the nociceptive balance. These are, among others, based on the frontal electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) response, evaluation of the autonomic state and autonomic reactions, spinal reflex pathways and calculated drug concentrations. The present review gives an overview on the topic of 'analgesia' monitoring, the available monitoring systems and their clinical evaluation. Most of the systems allow a rapid detection of the nociceptive input; nonetheless, the prediction of an autonomic or somatic response has still to be improved. Several studies reported fewer unwanted events, reduced opioid consumption and shorter emergence from anaesthesia, when opioid administration was based upon monitoring of the nociceptive-anti-nociceptive balance. However, research on the mechanisms of pain processing and for better tools to assess the 'analgesia' component has to continue in order to improve our daily practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24012235/

Seventeen patients were excluded, leaving 73 patients available for evaluation. Four patients (5.5%) required shunting based on EEG findings. Changes in cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) were assessed on the operative side using the average value for the 1 minute prior to cross-clamp and the lowest rSO2 value the first 5 minutes postclamp.

This was a prospective cohort study. Patients with a sufficient TCD window undergoing CEA from February 2009 to June 2011 were included. All patients were continuously monitored with NIRS and EEG. An intraluminal shunt was placed, selectively determined by predefined EEG changes in alpha, beta, theta, or delta activity. Relative changes in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) in the frontal lobe and mean blood flow velocity (Vmean) 30 seconds before carotid cross-clamping versus 2 minutes after carotid cross-clamping were related to shunt placement. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal thresholds. Diagnostic values were reported as positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV).
Of a cohort of 151 patients, 17(11%) showed EEG changes requiring shunt placement. The rSO2 and Vmean decreased more in the shunt group than in the non-shunt group (mean ± standard error of the mean) 21 ± 4% versus 7 ± 5% and 76 ± 6% versus 12 ± 3%, respectively (p < .005), Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a threshold of 16% decrease in rSO2 (PPV 76% and NPV 99%) and 48% decrease in Vmean (PPV 53% and NPV 99%) as the optimal cut-off value to detect cerebral ischemia during CEA under general anesthesia.
Compared with EEG, we found moderate PPV but high NPV for NIRS and TCD to detect cerebral ischemia during CEA under general anesthesia, meaning that both techniques independently may be suitable to exclude patients for unnecessary shunt use and to direct the use of selective shunting.

Continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring provides dynamic information and can be used to assess the evolution of EEG patterns and to detect seizures. cEEG can be made more simple by reducing the number of electrodes and by adding trend analysis to the original EEG curves. In our version of simplified cEEG, we combine a reduced montage, displaying two channels of the original EEG, with amplitude-integrated EEG trend curves (aEEG). This is a convenient method to monitor cerebral function in comatose patients after cardiac arrest but has yet to be validated against the gold standard, a multichannel cEEG. We recently proposed a simplified system for interpreting EEG rhythms after cardiac arrest, defining four major EEG patterns. In this topical review, we will discuss cEEG to monitor brain function after cardiac arrest in general and how a simplified cEEG, with a reduced number of electrodes and trend analysis, may facilitate and improve care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23876221/
23856193,Simultaneous bicoherence analysis of occipital and frontal electroencephalograms in awake and anesthetized subjects.,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,2014,"Hayashi K, Mukai N, Sawa T","Occipital electroencephalogram (EEG) activity is known to be different from the frontal EEG during wakefulness and anesthesia. However, less is known about occipital non-linear dynamics analyzed by EEG-bicoherence, which can reflect the oscillatory features that are dependent on thalamocortical modulation.
Forty patients were anesthetized using sevoflurane (1% or 3%) combined with remifentanil. Frontal and occipital EEGs were simultaneously collected, and bicoherence was analyzed before and after induction of anesthesia.
Occipital awake EEGs often demonstrate a bicoherence α peak, differing from frontal awake EEGs in the absence of bicoherence growth. With 1% sevoflurane, occipital α bicoherence disappeared and frontal α bicoherence peaks appeared. Although 3% sevoflurane caused an increase in occipital δ-θ normalized power, similar to the frontal region (peak relative δ-θ power, 13.1 ± 2.2% vs. 12.2 ± 2.7%, p>0.05), occipital bicoherence showed no growth in any frequency area, contrasting with the frontal bicoherence spectrum with a conspicuous peak in the δ-θ area (19.8 ± 8.9 vs. 43.6 ± 13.8, p<0.05).
The occipital bicoherence spectrum in the peri-anesthesia period is quite different from the frontal bicoherence spectrum, which is not usually obvious in the power spectrum.
Nonlinear regulation of the occipital EEG is different from the frontal EEG during every stage of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23856193/
23822476,Four dimensional chaos and intermittency in a mesoscopic model of the electroencephalogram.,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2013,"Dafilis MP, Frascoli F, Cadusch PJ, Liley DT","The occurrence of so-called four dimensional chaos in dynamical systems represented by coupled, nonlinear, ordinary differential equations is rarely reported in the literature. In this paper, we present evidence that Liley's mesoscopic theory of the electroencephalogram (EEG), which has been used to describe brain activity in a variety of clinically relevant contexts, possesses a chaotic attractor with a Kaplan-Yorke dimension significantly larger than three. This accounts for simple, high order chaos for a physiologically admissible parameter set. Whilst the Lyapunov spectrum of the attractor has only one positive exponent, the contracting dimensions are such that the integer part of the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is three, thus giving rise to four dimensional chaos. A one-parameter bifurcation analysis with respect to the parameter corresponding to extracortical input is conducted, with results indicating that the origin of chaos is due to an inverse period doubling cascade. Hence, in the vicinity of the high order, strange attractor, the model is shown to display intermittent behavior, with random alternations between oscillatory and chaotic regimes. This phenomenon represents a possible dynamical justification of some of the typical features of clinically established EEG traces, which can arise in the case of burst suppression in anesthesia and epileptic encephalopathies in early infancy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23822476/

This observational study investigated the incidence and severity of PIA and evaluated propofol as a treatment option in a patient population.
The study included 14 patients that underwent a series of ECTs performed either with or without an approximately 0.5-mg/kg propofol bolus after the end of an electroencephalography (EEG) seizure. Among other values, we documented PIA incidence and severity as rated by a simple score; orientation to person, time, place, and situation; transfer times to the postanesthesia care (PACU) and inpatient unit; nurses' and patients' rating of recovery period, and others and tested for significant differences.
Five minutes after the end of ECT, the patients showed moderate to severe PIA in 8 of 37 ECT sessions. Incidence was significantly lower when patients had received propofol (3/37). Transfer time to the PACU was longer, but transfer time to the inpatient unit was shorter after administration of propofol. The recovery period was rated significantly better after propofol administration by nurses and patients.
A single bolus of propofol administered after the end of the seizure reduced the incidence of post-ECT PIA. The PACU staff and patients rated the emergence period significantly better when propofol was administered.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23792779/

This retrospective study included 54 inpatients (aged 18-75 years) who met the DSM-IV criteria for major depression and were treated with bilateral ECT. For the first part of the study, the primary outcome was the mean stimulus charge per ECT session. For the second part, the main outcome measure was the proportion of patients achieving full remission.
Propofol-treated patients showed a higher mean stimulus charge (etomidate = 227.58 ± 130.44, propofol = 544.91 ± 237.56, p<0.001) despite the lack of a significant difference in starting threshold doses. The propofol group had shorter mean electroencephalogram (etomidate = 69.41 ± 22.50, propofol = 42.95 ± 22.26, p<0.001) seizure duration and motor (etomidate = 46.11 ± 14.38, propofol = 22.89 ± 7.13, p<0.001) seizure duration and a higher mean number of inadequate seizures (etomidate = 0.12 ± 0.15, propofol = 0.47 ± 0.26, p<0.001). No significant differences were found between the groups for the effects of the anesthetics on the efficacy of ECT.
Our study is limited by a retrospective design and the small number of patients treated with propofol restricted the sample size.
Anesthesia with propofol has a significant reducing effect on seizure duration during the course of ECT which results in more inadequate seizures, despite the use of a higher mean stimulus charge. Regarding the possible effect of the anesthetics on ECT, randomized clinical trials with sufficient power to detect differences are warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23774194/

Many drugs have been used in an attempt to attenuate these responses. To date, no comparative study of the acute hemodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine and esmolol in ECT has been published. Hence, this retrospective study aimed to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and esmolol on acute hemodynamic responses in patients undergoing ECT.
The anesthesia records for 66 patients who underwent a total of 198 ECT treatments performed between July 2009 and January 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. For each case, 1 seizure with 1-mg/kg propofol as control (group C), 1 seizure with 1-μg/kg dexmedetomidine combined with propofol (group D; total volume, 30 mL for 10 minutes), and 1 seizure with 1-mg/kg esmolol combined with propofol were compared (group E; total volume, 30 mL for 10 minutes). Anesthesia was induced with 1-mg/kg propofol, and then intravenous succinylcholine, 0.5-mg/kg, was administered. Heart rates and systolic and mean blood pressures were recorded at baseline (T0) and 1, 3, and 10 minutes after the seizure (T1, T2, and T3, respectively). The electroencephalographic (EEG) tracing motor seizure duration, and recovery times (spontaneous breathing, eye opening, and obeying commands) were recorded.
The baseline hemodynamic measurements were similar between the groups. Heart rates at T1, T2, and T3 were lower in group D than those in groups E and C (P < 0.05). Systolic blood pressures at T1, T2, and T3 were lower in group D than those in groups C (P < 0.05). In addition, systolic blood pressure at T3 was lower in group D than that in group E (P < 0.05). The mean blood pressure at T3 was significantly lower in group D than those in groups E and C (P <0.05). The electroencephalographic tracing, motor seizure durations, and recovery times were similar between the groups.
Dexmedetomidine administration before anesthesia induction reduced the acute hemodynamic response compared with esmolol administration in the early period of ECT. Therefore, dexmedetomidine may be effective in preventing acute hemodynamic responses to ECT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23774056/

Indeed, along with rapid eye movements (REM), respiration was one of the first physiological variables shown to be modulated across sleep stages. The study of sleep stages, their physiological correlates, and neurobiological underpinnings present a challenge because of the fragility and unpredictability of individual stages, not to mention sleep itself. Although anesthesia has often substituted as a model for a unitary stage of slow-wave (non-REM) sleep, it is only recently that urethane anesthesia has been proposed to model the full spectrum of sleep given the presence of spontaneous brain state alternations and concurrent physiological correlates that appear remarkably similar to natural sleep. We describe this model, its parallels with natural sleep, and its power for studying modulation of respiration. Specifically, we report data on the EEG characteristics across brain states under urethane anesthesia, the dependence of brain alternations on neurotransmitter systems, and the observations on state dependent modulation of respiration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23751523/
23744607,A closed-loop anesthetic delivery system for real-time control of burst suppression.,Journal of neural engineering,2013,"Liberman MY, Ching S, Chemali J, Brown EN","There is growing interest in using closed-loop anesthetic delivery (CLAD) systems to automate control of brain states (sedation, unconsciousness and antinociception) in patients receiving anesthesia care. The accuracy and reliability of these systems can be improved by using as control signals electroencephalogram (EEG) markers for which the neurophysiological links to the anesthetic-induced brain states are well established. Burst suppression, in which bursts of electrical activity alternate with periods of quiescence or suppression, is a well-known, readily discernible EEG marker of profound brain inactivation and unconsciousness. This pattern is commonly maintained when anesthetics are administered to produce a medically-induced coma for cerebral protection in patients suffering from brain injuries or to arrest brain activity in patients having uncontrollable seizures. Although the coma may be required for several hours or days, drug infusion rates are managed inefficiently by manual adjustment. Our objective is to design a CLAD system for burst suppression control to automate management of medically-induced coma.
We establish a CLAD system to control burst suppression consisting of: a two-dimensional linear system model relating the anesthetic brain level to the EEG dynamics; a new control signal, the burst suppression probability (BSP) defining the instantaneous probability of suppression; the BSP filter, a state-space algorithm to estimate the BSP from EEG recordings; a proportional-integral controller; and a system identification procedure to estimate the model and controller parameters.
We demonstrate reliable performance of our system in simulation studies of burst suppression control using both propofol and etomidate in rodent experiments based on Vijn and Sneyd, and in human experiments based on the Schnider pharmacokinetic model for propofol. Using propofol, we further demonstrate that our control system reliably tracks changing target levels of burst suppression in simulated human subjects across different epidemiological profiles.
Our results give new insights into CLAD system design and suggest a control-theory framework to automate second-to-second control of burst suppression for management of medically-induced coma.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23744607/

We hypothesised that the bispectral index of the EEG (BIS) could be a helpful tool in evaluating the depth of sedation in this difficult environment. The main objective of the present study was to assess the agreement of BIS with the clinical scales in the out-of-hospital setting.
This prospective study included mechanically ventilated patients. BIS values were blindly recorded continuously. A Ramsay score was performed every 5 min. The main judgement criterion was the correlation between BIS values and the Ramsay score.
72 patients were included, mostly presenting with toxic coma (36%) or neurological coma (21%). The median (IQR) BIS value was 85 (84-86) when the Ramsay score was 3, 80 (76-84) when the Ramsay score was 4, 61 (55-80) when the Ramsay score was 5 and 45 (38-60) when the Ramsay score was 6. According to Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, BIS was categorised into three classes (BIS<54 corresponding to Ramsay score 6, 54≤BIS<72 for Ramsay score 5 and BIS≥73 for Ramsay score ≤4). Based on these categories, the proportion of appropriate BIS values was 67% (217/323). The concordance correlation coefficient for repeated measurements was 0.54 (0.43-0.64). The agreement between BIS and the Ramsay score is moderate.
Prehospital measured BIS values appear poorly correlated with clinical assessment of the depth of sedation. For this reason, the use of BIS to guide prehospital sedation cannot be recommended.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23708914/

The hypothesis was that there is no difference in the change in serum catecholamines between PS using propofol with or without supplemental alfentanil.
This was a randomized, nonblinded pilot study of adult patients undergoing PS in the ED for the reduction of fractures and dislocations. Patients with pain before the procedure were treated with intravenous (IV) morphine sulfate until their pain was adequately treated for at least 20 minutes before starting the procedure. Patients were randomized to receive either 10 μg/kg alfentanil followed by 1 mg/kg propofol, followed by 0.5 mg/kg every 3 minutes as needed, or propofol only, dosed in similar fashion without supplemental alfentanil. Doses, vital signs, nasal end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), pulse oximetry, and bispectral electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis scores were recorded. Subclinical respiratory depression was defined as a change in ETCO2 > 10 mm Hg, an oxygen saturation of < 92% at any time, or an absent ETCO2 waveform at any time. Clinical events related to respiratory depression were noted during the procedure, including the addition of or increase in the flow rate of supplemental oxygen, the use of a bag-valve-mask apparatus, airway repositioning, or stimulation to induce breathing. Blood was drawn 1 minute prior to the administration of the medications for PS and again 1 minute after completion of the procedure for which the patient was sedated. Serum was tested for total catecholamines, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Postprocedure, patients were asked to report any pain perceived during the procedure. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and chi-square tests, as appropriate.
Twenty patients were enrolled; 10 received propofol and 10 received propofol with alfentanil. No clinically significant complications were noted. Subclinical respiratory depression was seen in four of 10 (40%) patients in the propofol group and five of 10 (50%) patients in the propofol/alfentanil group (effect size = -10%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -53% to 33%). There was no difference in the rate of clinical signs of respiratory depression between the two groups. Pain during the procedure was reported by two of 10 (20%) patients in the propofol group and five of 10 (50%) patients in the propofol/alfentanil group (effect size = -30%, 95% CI = -70% to 10%). Recall of some part of the procedure was reported by 0 of 10 (0%) patients in the propofol group and five of 10 (50%) of patients in the propofol/alfentanil group (effect size = -50%, 95% CI = -81% to -19%). There was no difference in the baseline or postprocedure catecholamine levels between the groups.
No difference in serum catecholamines was detected immediately after PS between patients who receive propofol with and without supplemental opioid in this small pilot study. PS using propofol only without supplemental opioid did not appear to induce markers of physiologic stress in this small pilot study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23701339/

The goal of our study including 137 patients was research of effects of the spinal and general anaesthesia while monitoring the Bispectral Index (BIS) during the surgery. We focused mainly on the need of postoperative analgesia and possibility to discharge patient to home care after the surgery with the above mentioned type of anaesthesia. BIS helped us to monitor the sufficiency of anaesthesia and anaesthetics dosage regulation that was reflected in earlier awakening and faster reconvalescence, as well as saving anaesthetics.
The length of surgery was not affected by the particular type of anaesthetic procedures (25.7 minutes for the general anaesthesia and 30.2 minutes for the spinal anaesthesia). The need for postoperative analgesia was necessary for the period of 240.0 minutes after the completion of surgery for the general anaesthesia and 313.0 minutes for the spinal anaesthesia after the administration of anaesthetics intrathecally.

To also describe the revised perioperative fluid management strategy espoused by Holliday and Segar and noninvasive measures that may predict who will respond positively to fluid loading.
The depth of anesthesia during the early washin period with sevoflurane 8% is one-third less than during halothane. Eight percent sevoflurane rarely causes clinical seizures; more commonly, it causes epileptiform EEG activity that only weakly portends seizure activity. When preceded by nitrous oxide, midazolam or normocapnia, the risk of inducing epileptiform activity during spontaneous respiration is exceedingly small. Decreasing the inspired concentration of sevoflurane upon loss of the eyelash reflex to prevent epileptiform activity has not been shown to reduce the risk of clinical seizures, but more importantly, it may increase the risk of awareness if the child is stimulated. Isotonic intravenous solutions should be infused in volumes of 20-40 ml/kg over 2-4 h in children undergoing elective surgery. Postoperatively, these infusions may be continued at rates of 2/1/0.5 ml/kg/h; serum sodium concentration should be measured periodically. Noninvasive measures currently do not reliably identify those children who will respond positively to fluid boluses.
Sevoflurane is a well tolerated induction agent that rarely causes seizures in children, but may cause awareness if the inspired concentration is prematurely reduced. Perioperative isotonic fluids should be infused at 20-40 ml/kg over 2-4 h during elective surgery. Noninvasive metrics do not predict a child's responsiveness to fluid loading.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23614958/

The doses of drugs prescribed were as follows: hydroxyzine 1.43±0.74mg/kg CH 38±14.73mg/kg. The time to go on a sleep was 34.68±30.75min in hydroxyzine and 32.34±26.83min in CH group (p>0.05). Eighty-nine percent of cases who were sedated with CH and 89.6% of cases who sedated with hydroxyzine were able to sleep (p>0.05). The background rhythm was faster with CH compared to hydroxyzine (p<0.05). There were no association between the occurrence of fast background rhythm and the doses of CH.

The EEG is a recording of brain electrical activity, and it contains valuable information related to the different physiological states of the brain. This study proposes a novel automated method consisting of two steps for assessing anesthesia depth. Initially, the sample entropy and permutation entropy features were extracted from the EEG signal. Because EEG-derived parameters represent different aspects of the EEG features, it would be reasonable to use multiple parameters to assess the effect of the anesthetic. The sample entropy and permutation entropy features quantified the amount of complexity or irregularity in the EEG data and were conceptually simple, computationally efficient and artifact-resistant. Next, the extracted features were used as input for an artificial neural network, which was a data processing system based on the structure of a biological nervous system. The experimental results indicated that an overall accuracy of 88% could be obtained during sevoflurane anesthesia in 17 patients to classify the EEG data into awake, light, general and deep anesthetized states. In addition, this method yielded a classification accuracy of 92.4% to distinguish between awake and general anesthesia in an independent database of propofol and desflurane anesthesia in 129 patients.

This study evaluated the inhibitory effects of propofol on MEG spike sources (MEGSSs) among different types of seizures in patients who underwent two separate MEG studies with and without total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using propofol.
We studied 19 children (1-14 years; mean, 6.2 years) who had MEG with and without TIVA. TIVA was administered using propofol (0.03-0.06 mg/kg/min) to record MEG with simultaneous EEG. We analyzed number of spikes of MEG and MEGSSs comparing MEG studies done with and without TIVA.
Seizures were divided into nine focal seizure (FS) with/without secondary generalization, five epileptic spasm (ES), and five generalized seizure (GS). TIVA significantly decreased the number of MEG spikes/min (from 4.5 to 2.0) in five FS without secondary generalization (p<0.05). The number of MEG spikes/min was significantly lower (1.9) in FS than that in non-FS (ES+GS, 6.1) (p<0.01). MEGSSs without TIVA were clustered in 15 patients (6FS; 4ES; 5GS), scattered in four (3FS; 1ES). MEG under TIVA showed clusters in 10 patients (1FS; 4ES; 5GS), scatters in three (2FS; 1ES) and no MEGSS in six patients with FS. Under TIVA, nine (90%) of ten patients with non-FS showed MEGSSs clusters compared to one (11%) of nine patients with FS (p<0.01).
Reduction of MEGSSs occurred in patients with FS under TIVA. Diffuse/generalized spikes in non-FS are not affected by TIVA. Propofol may decrease focal spikes in the epileptic cortex in FS. Cortical hyperexcitability in non-FS group would be stronger or more extensive than that in the FS group of patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23562603/
23533253,Proof of concept evaluation of the electroencephalophone as a discriminator between wakefulness and general anaesthesia.,British journal of anaesthesia,2013,"Glen J, Porr B, Hamilton R, Tait L","Depth of anaesthesia (DOA) monitors based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) are commonly used in anaesthetic practice. Their technology relies on mathematical analysis of the EEG waveform, generally resulting in a number which corresponds to anaesthetic depth. We have created a novel method of interpreting the EEG, which retains its underlying complexity. This method consists of turning the EEG into a sound: the electroencephalophone (EEP).
In a pilot study, we recorded awake and anaesthetized EEGs from six patients. We transformed each EEG into an audio signal using a ring buffer with a write frequency of 1 kHz and a read frequency of 48 kHz, thus elevating all output frequencies by a factor of 48. In essence, the listener hears the previous 12 s of EEG data compressed into 250 ms, updated every 250 ms. From these data, we generated a bank of 5 s audio clips, which were then used to train and test a sample of 23 anaesthetists.
After training, 21 of the 23 anaesthetists were able to use the EEP to correctly identify the conscious state of >5 of 10 randomly selected patients (P<0.001). The median score was 8 out of 10, with an inter-quartile range of 7-9.
The EEP shows promise as a DOA monitor. However, extensive validation would be required in a variety of clinical settings before it could be accepted into mainstream clinical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23533253/

Seventy-four patients who received at least 3 ECT treatments with etomidate as an anesthetic were included. The association between seizure duration established by EEG and the cuff method, and etomidate dose (in mg/kg) was assessed retrospectively within individual patients, using mixed-effects model analysis with random intercept and random slope. Generalized estimating equation analysis was used to assess whether chances of reaching an adequate seizure depended on dose.
A small negative association between dose of etomidate and motor and EEG seizure duration was found with a maximum correlation of -0.21. This correlation is considered weak and therefore lacks clinical significance. Higher doses of etomidate decreased the chances of an adequate seizure with an odds ratio of 0.68 per 0.1-mg/kg increase in etomidate (95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.90, P-value: 0.007). With a maximum dose of 0.3 mg/kg, 94.1% of the seizures were adequate (95% confidence interval, 91.0-96.2).
Our data confirm that there is no clinically relevant dose-dependent relation between etomidate and seizure duration in ECT when etomidate is administered as advised in current international guidelines.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23519220/

To develop EEG signatures that track loss and recovery of consciousness under GA, we recorded high-density EEGs in humans during gradual induction of and emergence from unconsciousness with propofol. The subjects executed an auditory task at 4-s intervals consisting of interleaved verbal and click stimuli to identify loss and recovery of consciousness. During induction, subjects lost responsiveness to the less salient clicks before losing responsiveness to the more salient verbal stimuli; during emergence they recovered responsiveness to the verbal stimuli before recovering responsiveness to the clicks. The median frequency and bandwidth of the frontal EEG power tracked the probability of response to the verbal stimuli during the transitions in consciousness. Loss of consciousness was marked simultaneously by an increase in low-frequency EEG power (<1 Hz), the loss of spatially coherent occipital alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz), and the appearance of spatially coherent frontal alpha oscillations. These dynamics reversed with recovery of consciousness. The low-frequency phase modulated alpha amplitude in two distinct patterns. During profound unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency peaks, whereas during the transition into and out of unconsciousness, alpha amplitudes were maximal at low-frequency nadirs. This latter phase-amplitude relationship predicted recovery of consciousness. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of propofol-induced unconsciousness, establish EEG signatures of this brain state that track transitions in consciousness precisely, and suggest strategies for monitoring the brain activity of patients receiving GA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23487781/

Significant reductions in parietal level functional connectivity have been shown to occur during general anesthesia with propofol and a range of other GABAergic general anesthetic agents. Using two analysis approaches (1) a graph theoretic analysis based on surrogate-corrected zero-lag correlations of scalp EEG, and (2) a global coherence analysis based on the EEG cross-spectrum, we reveal that sedation with the NMDA receptor antagonist nitrous oxide (N2O), an agent that has quite different electroencephalographic effects compared to the inductive general anesthetics, also causes significant alterations in parietal level functional networks, as well as changes in full brain and frontal level networks. A total of 20 subjects underwent N2O inhalation at either 20%, 40% or 60% peak N2O/O2 gas concentration levels. N2O-induced reductions in parietal network level functional connectivity (on the order of 50%) were exclusively detected by utilising a surface Laplacian derivation, suggesting that superficial, smaller spatial scale, cortical networks were most affected. In contrast reductions in frontal network functional connectivity were optimally discriminated using a common-reference derivation (reductions on the order of 10%), indicating that the NMDA antagonist N2O induces spatially coherent and widespread perturbations in frontal activity. Our findings not only give important weight to the idea of agent invariant final network changes underlying drug-induced reductions in consciousness, but also provide significant impetus for the application and development of multiscale functional analyses to systematically characterise the network level cortical effects of NMDA receptor related hypofunction. Future work at the source space level will be needed to verify the consistency between cortical network changes seen at the source level and those presented here at the EEG sensor space level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23457568/

This is a pilot study aiming to assess whether spontaneous activity transients (SAT) in the early preterm babies are affected by drugs that are routinely used in neonatal intensive care.
We collected retrospectively seventeen EEG recordings (15 babies, conceptional age 26-33weeks, no brain lesions) that were divided into groups according to drug administration at the time of EEG: phenobarbital, fentanyl, theophylline, and controls. SATs were extracted from the EEG for further analysis with several advanced time-series analysis paradigms.
The visual appearance of SATs was unaffected by drugs. Phenobarbital reduced the total power of the SAT events. Both fentanyl and phenobarbital reduced the length of SATs, and enhanced the oscillations at higher frequencies. Theophylline reduced the oscillatory activity at middle frequencies during SAT, but enhanced oscillations at higher frequencies during time-period prior to SAT.
Our findings suggest, that (i) all drugs examined affect brain activity in ways that are not seen in the visual EEG interpretation, and that (ii) both acute and long term (i.e. developmental) effects of these drugs on brain may warrant more attention as a part of optimizing preterm neurological care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23422259/
23419669,Auditory stimuli as a contributor to consciousness while under general anesthesia.,Medical hypotheses,2013,"Thiele RH, Knipper E, Dunn LK, Nemergut EC","The incidence of intraoperative awareness under general anesthesia approaches 1% in high-risk patients. Anesthesiologists commonly utilize processed electroencephalograms (EEG) in order to monitor ""depth"" of anesthesia, the most common of which is the Bispectral Index (BIS). The B-aware and B-Unaware trials, which were designed to test the efficacy of the BIS monitor, noted an auditory component in 16 of 17 confirmed cases of intraoperative awareness. Implicit auditory memory formation has been documented under general anesthesia. Small studies have documented a significant effect of noise on BIS scores during monitored anesthesia care.
Twenty-two patients undergoing general anesthesia received earplugs after the induction of anesthesia. Every ten minutes the earplugs were reinserted or removed. Noise levels were recorded every 0.125 s and both average and maximal BIS scores were recorded every minute. Non-parametric analysis of both populations (with and without earplugs) was performed. A mixed effects model with one degree of freedom (with and without earplugs) was generated to take into account the effect of anesthetic agents on BIS scores.
3009 min of data were recorded. The median and range (25-75%) BIS scores were 39 (29-46) and 39 (28-44) with and without earplugs in place, respectively. Earplugs were associated with lower BIS scores (p=0.0183). The mixed effects model confirmed this relationship (p<0.001). Subgroup analysis of BIS scores in which the potential for awareness existed (maximum BIS>60 in any one minute epoch) showed a 32% reduction in the incidence of maximal BIS scores exceeding 60 (p=0.0012). There was no relationship between ambient noise level and average maximal BIS score (R(2)=0.003).
Our study suggests that earplugs may reduce the incidence of BIS scores >60 in patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia and that auditory stimuli may affect EEG interpretation. Because of the low cost and safety of noise reduction, as well as the catastrophic implications of intraoperative awareness, further studies to explore the effects of auditory stimuli on awareness and anesthesia are warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23419669/

We expected that the cAAI was more useful to monitor anesthetic effect of sevoflurane than the BIS and AAI. The present study compared the changes of cAAI, AAI, and BIS in different sevoflurane concentration. Forty-five adult patients were anesthetized with sevoflurane in 50 % nitrous oxide. AAI (AEP version 1.4), cAAI (AEP version 1.6), and BIS (A-2000) were compared (each 15 patients in AAI, cAAI, and BIS groups) before induction, just before and after intubation, at 10 min since sevoflurane was set to 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 %, and after extubation. All three indices decreased significantly before intubation. The cAAI was significantly higher than the AAI at sevoflurane 1.0 and 1.5 %. The AAI and BIS were significantly lower at sevoflurane 2.0 % than those at sevoflurane 1.0 %, but the cAAI did not. The cAAI had the largest and AAI had the smallest inter-individual variation.

In May 2012, a search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Ovid MEDLINE for prospective trials with 20 patients or more where a cerebral monitoring system was compared with clinical brain monitoring during a carotid endarterectomy performed under regional anesthesia. The quality of the study was evaluated with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Data were extracted independently by the two investigators.
Data could be extracted for 4,664 measurements taken from 29 studies: transcranial Doppler (TCD) = 739; cerebral saturation = 320; stump pressure = 2,549; electroencephalography (EEG) = 742; evoked potentials = 187; jugular venous saturation = 79; and jugular venous lactate = 48. The pooled diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained for EEG, TCD, stump pressure, evoked potentials, and cerebral saturation: (DOR 65.3; 95% CI 20.5 to 207.7; I(2) [56.8%]); (DOR 58.1; 95% CI 23.0 to 146.3; I(2) [24.9%]); (DOR 27.8; 95% CI 13.4 to 57.9; I(2) [59.9]); (DOR 17.2; 95% CI 2.4 to 123.9 I(2) [69.1]); and (DOR 12.1; 95% CI 3.5 to 41.2; I(2) [30.8]), respectively. Sequential testing with stump pressure 25 mmHg followed by either TCD or EEG delivered the best post-test probabilities. For EEG, the DOR increases with the number of channels used (P = 0.03).

To explore the dynamical features of brain activity in anesthesia, a permutation auto-mutual information (PAMI) method is proposed to measure the information coupling of electroencephalogram (EEG) time series obtained in anesthesia.
The PAMI is developed and applied on EEG data collected from 19 patients under sevoflurane anesthesia. The results are compared with the traditional auto-mutual information (AMI), SynchFastSlow (SFS, derived from the BIS index), permutation entropy (PE), composite PE (CPE), response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE). Performance of all indices is assessed by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling and prediction probability.
The PK/PD modeling and prediction probability analysis show that the PAMI index correlates closely with the anesthetic effect. The coefficient of determination R(2) between PAMI values and the sevoflurane effect site concentrations, and the prediction probability Pk are higher in comparison with other indices. The information coupling in EEG series can be applied to indicate the effect of the anesthetic drug sevoflurane on the brain activity as well as other indices. The PAMI of the EEG signals is suggested as a new index to track drug concentration change.
The PAMI is a useful index for analyzing the EEG dynamics during general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23370095/

Annual International Conference,2012,"Pirondini E, Babadi B, Lamus C, Brown EN, Purdon PL","Cortical activity can be estimated from electroencephalogram (EEG) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data by solving an ill-conditioned inverse problem that is regularized using neuroanatomical, computational, and dynamic constraints. Recent methods have incorporated spatio-temporal dynamics into the inverse problem framework. In this approach, spatio-temporal interactions between neighboring sources enforce a form of spatial smoothing that enhances source localization quality. However, spatial smoothing could also occur by way of correlations within the state noise process that drives the underlying dynamic model. Estimating the spatial covariance structure of this state noise is challenging, particularly in EEG and MEG data where the number of underlying sources is far greater than the number of sensors. However, the EEG/MEG data are sparse compared to the large number of sources, and thus sparse constraints could be used to simplify the form of the state noise spatial covariance. In this work, we introduce an empirically tailored basis to represent the spatial covariance structure within the state noise processes of a cortical dynamic model for EEG source localization. We augment the method presented in Lamus, et al. (2011) to allow for sparsity enforcing priors on the covariance parameters. Simulation studies as well as analysis of real data reveal significant gains in the source localization performance over existing algorithms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23367479/

Seizures in focal MRE are generated by a single epileptogenic zone (or focus), thus there is potentially a curative procedure - surgical resection. This procedure depends significantly on correct identification of the focus, which is often uncertain in clinical practice. In this study, we analyzed intracranial stereotaxic EEG (sEEG) data recorded in two human patients with drug-resistant epilepsy prior to undergoing resection surgery. We view the sEEG data as samples from the brain network and hypothesize that seizure foci can be identified based on their network connectivity during seizure. Specifically, we computed a time sequence of connectivity matrices from EEG recordings that represent network structure over time. For each patient, connectivity between electrodes was measured using the coherence in a given frequency band. Matrix structure was analyzed using singular value decomposition and the leading singular vector was used to estimate each electrode's time dependent centrality (importance to the network's connectivity). Our preliminary study suggests that seizure foci may be the most weakly connected regions in the brain during the beginning of a seizure and the most strongly connected regions towards the end of a seizure. Additionally, in one of the patients analyzed, the network connectivity under anesthesia highlights seizure foci. Ultimately, network centrality computed from sEEG activity may be used to develop an automated, reliable, and computationally efficient algorithm for identifying seizure foci.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23367090/

Since the origin of these BFV oscillations is not known, we explored their possible causative relationships with oscillations in EEG-PV at around 0.06Hz. We monitored 28 patients undergoing non-pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass using transcranial Doppler sonography and scalp electroencephalography at two levels of anesthesia, deep (prevalence of burst suppression rhythm) and moderate (prevalence of theta rhythm). Under deep anesthesia, the EEG bursts suppression pattern was highly correlative with BFV oscillations. Hence, a detailed quantitative picture of the coupling between electrical brain activity and BFV was derived, both in deep and moderate anesthesia, via linear and non linear processing of EEG-PV and BFV signals, resorting to widely used measures of signal coupling such as frequency of oscillations, coherence, Granger causality and cross-approximate entropy. Results strongly suggest the existence of coupling between EEG-PV and BFV. In moderate anesthesia EEG-PV mean dominant frequency is similar to frequency of BFV oscillations (0.065±0.010Hz vs 0.045±0.019Hz); coherence between the two signals was significant in about 55% of subjects, and the Granger causality suggested an EEG-PV→BFV causal effect direction. The strength of the coupling increased with deepening anesthesia, as EEG-PV oscillations mean dominant frequency virtually coincided with the BFV peak frequency (0.062±0.017Hz vs 0.060±0.024Hz), and coherence became significant in a larger number (65%) of subjects. Cross-approximate entropy decreased significantly from moderate to deep anesthesia, indicating a higher level of synchrony between the two signals. Presence of a subcortical brain pacemaker that drives vascular infra-slow oscillations in the brain is proposed. These findings allow to suggest an original hypothesis explaining the mechanism underlying infra-slow neurovascular coupling.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23357071/

This method takes the limiting large-sample normal distribution as posterior inferences to implement the Bayesian paradigm. The maximum a posterior (MAP) is applied to denoise the wavelet coefficients based on a shrinkage function. When the anesthesia states change from awake to light, moderate, and deep anesthesia, the MAP values increase gradually. Based on these changes, a new function B(DoA) is designed to assess the DoA. The new proposed method is evaluated using anesthetized EEG recordings and BIS data from 25 patients. The Bland-Alman plot is used to verify the agreement of B(DoA) and the popular BIS index. A correlation between B(DoA) and BIS was measured using prediction probability P(K). In order to estimate the accuracy of DoA, the effect of sample n and variance τ on the maximum posterior probability is studied. The results show that the new index accurately estimates the patient's hypnotic states.

We analyzed human data of electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) maps of oxygen (CMR(O2)) and glucose (CMR(glc)) utilization, and calibrated fMRI from a variety of experimental conditions. CMR(glc) and EEG in the visual cortex were tightly coupled over several conditions, showing that the oxidative demand for signaling was four times greater than the demand for nonsignaling events in the awake state. Variations of CMR(O2) and CMR(glc) from gray-matter regions and networks were within ±10% of means, suggesting that most areas required similar energy for ubiquitously high resting activity. Human calibrated fMRI results suggest that changes of fMRI signal in cognitive studies contribute at most ±10% CMR(O2) changes from rest.

The calculation of PE involves the somewhat arbitrary selection of embedding dimension (m) and lag (τ) parameters. Previous studies of PE include the analysis of EEG signals under sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia, where different parameter settings were determined using a number of different criteria. In this study we choose parameter values based on the quantitative performance, to quantify the effect of a wide range of concentrations of isoflurane on the EEG. We analyzed a set of previously published EEG data, obtained from 29 patients who underwent elective abdominal surgery under isoflurane general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia. PE indices using a range of different parameter settings (m = 3-7, τ = 1-5) were calculated. These indices were evaluated as regards: the correlation coefficient (r) with isoflurane end-tidal concentration, the relationship with isoflurane effect-site concentration assessed by the coefficient of determination (R (2)) of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models, and the prediction probability (PK). The embedding dimension (m) and lag (τ) have significant effect on the r values (Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, p < 0.001). The proposed new permutation entropy index (NPEI) [a combination of PE(m = 3, τ = 2) and PE(m = 3, τ = 3)] performed best among all the parameter combinations, with r = 0.89(0.83-0.94), R (2) = 0.82(0.76-0.87), and PK = 0.80 (0.76-0.85). Further comparison with previously suggested PE measures, as well as other unrelated EEG measures, indicates the superiority of the NPEI. The PE can be utilized to indicate the dynamical changes of EEG signals under isoflurane anesthesia. In this study, the NPEI measure that combines the PE with m = 3, τ = 2 and that with m = 3, τ = 3 is optimal.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23264067/

BIS monitoring allowed the adequate number of bursts/minutes to be predicted in 18 patients and did not detect an overdosage in 2.
While asymmetric BIS values in TBI patients occur whatever the kind of injury, they were not found to be clinically relevant in most of these heavily sedated patients. Asymmetrical BIS monitoring might be sufficient to monitor barbiturate infusion in TBI provided that the concordance between BIS and EEG is regularly checked.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23182181/

The aim of this study was to derive normative data on aEEG parameters by means of longitudinal characterization and to evaluate the impact of gestational age (GA), postnatal age (PNA), postmenstrual age, sedation, and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).
Recordings from 61 infants with GA 28-31 weeks were obtained during the first 72 h, then weekly until the age of 4 wk. Infants were divided into three groups: (i) no sedation, no PDA, (ii) sedation, no PDA, and (iii) sedation, PDA. Assessed parameters included background activity, cycling, amplitude, and log ratio of the maximum/minimum amplitude.
GA and PNA had a significant impact within 72 h. Sedation modified aEEG, and presence of PDA was associated with reduced aEEG scores within 72 h. The log ratio of the amplitude correlated with GA but was unaffected by sedation and PDA.
Evaluation of electrocortical background activity within the first postnatal hours and longitudinally over days and weeks is important to better understand the postnatal factors impacting cerebral function in preterm infants. There is a need to agree on definitions and a standardized reporting system in order to permit comparisons between studies and establish aEEG as a method for routine monitoring of preterm infants.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23174705/
23165870,Cortical mechanisms of loss of consciousness: insight from TMS/EEG studies.,Archives italiennes de biologie,2012,"Massimini M, Ferrarelli F, Sarasso S, Tononi G","In a recent series of experiments we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) response to a direct cortical stimulation in humans during wakefulness, NREM sleep, REM sleep and anesthesia by means of a combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-density EEG (hd-EEG). TMS/hd-EEG measurements showed that, while during wakefulness and REM sleep the brain is able to sustain long-range specific patterns of activation, during NREM sleep and Midazolam-induced anesthesia, when consciousness fades, this ability is lot: the thalamocortical system, despite being active and reactive, either breaks down in causally independent modules (producing a local slow wave), or it bursts into an explosive and non-specific response (producing a global EEG slow wave). We hypothesize that, like spontaneous sleep slow waves, the slow waves triggered by TMS during sleep and anaesthesia are due to bistability between upand down-states in thalamocortical circuits. In this condition, the inescapable occurrence of a silent, down state after an initial activation impairs the ability of thalamocortical circuits to sustain long-range, differentiated patterns of activation, a theoretical requisite for consciousness. According to animal experiments and computer simulations, thalamocortical bistability may result from increased K-currents, from alterations of the balance between excitation and inhibition and from partial cortical de-afferentation. We hypothesize that these factor may play an important role in determining loss, and recovery, of consciousness also in brain-injured subjects. If this is the case, some types of brain lesions may impair information transmission, above and beyond the associated anatomical disconnection, by inducing bistability in portions of the thalamocortical system that are otherwise healthy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23165870/

However, there are significant theoretical limitations regarding its sensitivity in detecting transient episodes of inter-frequency coupling. Therefore, we used a recently developed wavelet bicoherence method to investigate the cross-frequency coupling in the EEG of patients under isoflurane anaesthesia; examining the relationship between the patterns of wavelet bicoherence and the isoflurane concentrations.
We analysed a set of previously published EEG data, obtained from 29 patients who underwent elective abdominal surgery under isoflurane anaesthesia. Artifact-free, 1 min EEG segments at different isoflurane concentrations were extracted from each subject and the wavelet bicoherence calculated for all pairs of frequencies from 0.5 to 20 Hz.
Isoflurane caused two peaks in the α (6-13 Hz) and slow δ (<1 Hz) regions of the bicoherence matrix diagonal. Higher concentrations of isoflurane shifted the α peak to lower frequencies [11.3 (0.9) Hz at 0.3% to 7.1 (1.2) Hz at 1.5%], as has been previously observed in the power spectra. Outside the diagonal, we also found a significant α peak that was phase-coupled to the slow δ waves; higher concentrations of isoflurane shifted this peak to lower frequencies [10.8 (1.2) to 7.7 (0.7) Hz].
Isoflurane caused cross-frequency coupling between α and slow δ waves. Increasing isoflurane concentration slowed the α frequencies where the coupling had occurred. This phenomenon of α-δ coupling suggests that slow cortical oscillations organize the higher α band activity, which is consistent with other studies in natural sleep.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23161358/

We evaluated bispectral index (BIS) monitoring as a tool to identify adult patients that awakened during therapeutic hypothermia.
Review of prospectively collected registry data, with retrospective chart review of patient descriptions during hypothermia. Data are presented as median (interquartile range).
7 of 309 patients (2.2%) treated with TH over 6 years awoke (followed commands) prior to completing hypothermia. Median age was 58 (54-66) years; 71% were male, cardiac arrest was witnessed in 6 (86%) and out-of-hospital in 6 (86%), and 4 patients (57%) were transferred from another hospital. 5 patients (71%) had an initial rhythm of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, time to return of spontaneous circulation was 17 (12-23)min. The BIS value after first NMB dose during TH was 63, 45, 43, 52, 62, 54, and 42 (median 52, IQR 44-58, 95% confidence interval 46-58). The median BIS value in the remaining data set (n=302) was 18 (6-36), p<0.001, and only 6% of BIS1 values were >46.

This is especially true for electroencephalography (EEG) during general anesthesia because of the significant alteration of the power spectrum. In this study we quantitatively evaluated the genuine and spurious phase synchronization strength (PSS) of EEG during consciousness, general anesthesia, and recovery. A computational approach based on the randomized data method was used for evaluating genuine and spurious PSS. The validity of the method was tested with a simulated dataset. We applied this method to the EEG of normal subjects undergoing general anesthesia and investigated the finite size effects of EEG references, data length and spectral content on phase synchronization. The most influential factor for genuine PSS was the type of EEG reference; the most influential factor for spurious PSS was the spectral content. Genuine and spurious PSS showed characteristic temporal patterns for each frequency band across consciousness and anesthesia. Simultaneous measurement of both genuine and spurious PSS during general anesthesia is necessary in order to avoid incorrect interpretations regarding states of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23056281/

One possible mechanism might be the impairment of cerebrovascular autoregulation (AR) by sepsis, leading to cerebral hypo- or hyperperfusion in these haemodynamically unstable patients. Therefore, the present study investigates the relationship between the incidence of SAD and the status of AR during sepsis.
Cerebral blood flow velocity was measured using transcranial Doppler sonography and was correlated with the invasive arterial blood pressure curve to calculate the index of AR Mx (Mx>0.3 indicates impaired AR). Mx was measured daily during the first 4 days of sepsis. Diagnosis of a SAD was performed using the confusion assessment method for ICU (CAM-ICU) and, furthermore the predominant brain electrical activity in electroencephalogram (EEG) both at day 4 after reduction of sedation to RASS >-2.
30 critically ill adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (APACHE II 32 ± 6) were included. AR was impaired at day 1 in 60%, day 2 in 59%, day 3 in 41% and day 4 in 46% of patients; SAD detected by CAM-ICU was present in 76 % of patients. Impaired AR at day 1 was associated with the incidence of SAD at day 4 (p = 0.035).
AR is impaired in the great majority of patients with severe sepsis during the first two days. Impaired AR is associated with SAD, suggesting that dysfunction of AR is one of the trigger mechanisms contributing to the development of SAD.

The patient could be weaned off the respirator, transferred to an ordinary ward then to a rehabilitation clinic. This is the first report of a positive outcome of rTMS treatment in super-refractory status epilepticus. In the context of refractory partial status epilepticus, neuromodulation through rTMS is a safe treatment option.

Unfortunately, pharmacologically paralyzed patients cannot seek attention by moving. Their attempted movements may however induce detectable EEG changes over the motor cortex. Here, methods from the area of movement-based brain-computer interfacing are proposed as a novel direction in anesthesia monitoring. Optimal settings for development of such a paradigm are studied to allow for a clinically feasible system. A classifier was trained on recorded EEG data of ten healthy non-anesthetized participants executing 3-second movement tasks. Extensive analysis was performed on this data to obtain an optimal EEG channel set and optimal features for use in a movement detection paradigm. EEG during movement could be distinguished from EEG during non-movement with very high accuracy. After a short calibration session, an average classification rate of 92% was obtained using nine EEG channels over the motor cortex, combined movement and post-movement signals, a frequency resolution of 4 Hz and a frequency range of 8-24 Hz. Using Monte Carlo simulation and a simple decision making paradigm, this translated into a probability of 99% of true positive movement detection within the first two and a half minutes after movement onset. A very low mean false positive rate of <0.01% was obtained. The current results corroborate the feasibility of detecting movement-related EEG signals, bearing in mind the clinical demands for use during surgery.

Healthy male participants were administered 20% (n=8) or 40% (n=8) N(2)O while having high-density (modified 10-20) noise minimized EEG recordings.
Nitrous oxide was found to produce clear reductions in resting total power, particularly at frontal-vertex sites. These reductions were found to principally reflect reductions in band-limited delta power. Following the termination of N(2)O inhalation, during N(2)O washout, selective increases in frontal theta power were observed that increased above baseline values.
Nitrous oxide does not produce the classical anteriorization of slow wave activity typically seen during anesthetic induction. Instead N(2)O reduces frontal slow wave (delta) activity, which during gas washout produces a withdrawal response of enhanced frontal slow wave (theta) activity.
Attempts to characterize a unitary mechanism of loss of consciousness during anesthesia on the basis of the topographic electroencephalographic changes is challenged by the distinct EEG effects that N(2)O has when compared to other well known anesthetic agents that include propofol and sevoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22968005/

A non-evolving EEG spike burst/isoelectric suppression pattern after the first 24 hours almost invariably indicates poor outcome, while an evolving pattern implies nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) that may ""hide"" surviving brain activity and is amenable to treatment.
We present the case of a 53-year-old woman who had a witnessed out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, was resuscitated by paramedics, but remained comatose. An EEG, performed 36 hours post-insult, showed an unremitting, non-evolving, unresponsive 2-6 Hz high-voltage spike burst/isoelectric suppression pattern, which remained unchanged at 96 hours post-insult, following therapeutic hypothermia. During this period, she was completely off sedation and taking triple antiepileptic treatment, without systemic confounding disorders. Although the initial pattern was indicative of poor neurological outcome, she eventually made meaningful functional recovery; the last EEG showed satisfactory background rhythms and stimulus-induced epileptiform discharges without seizures.
In post-anoxic coma, non-evolving >2 Hz spike burst/isoelectric suppression pattern may still reflect NCSE and therefore should be considered in the diagnostic EEG criteria for NCSE.

Retrospective study at a university hospital neuro-intensive care unit, from January 2008 until June 2010. Patients were treated according to a local protocol, and were initially sedated with midazolam or propofol or combinations of these sedative agents. Thiopental was added for treatment of intracranial hypertension. No wake-up tests were performed. Using NicoletOne(®) equipment (VIASYS Healthcare Inc., USA), continuous EEG recordings based on four electrodes and a reference electrode was inspected at full length both in a two electrode bipolar and a four-channel referential montage.

Many authorities have suggested that anaesthesiologists using these monitors should interpret the raw EEG waveform seen on the anaesthesia monitor.
In 34 patients anaesthetized with propofol using two doses of rocuronium (0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg), we studied whether the EMG arousal can be detected visually on the anaesthesia monitor. The Bispectral Index (BIS) and Entropy biosignals on the monitor were recorded with a video camera, and the one-channel EEG recorded by the Entropy strip was collected on a laptop computer. The recordings and the one-channel EEG were analyzed offline by two experts (anaesthesiologist and neurophysiologist), both with a long experience on anaesthesia-related EEG.
EMG arousal existed in 14/34 and 13/33 patients in the BIS and Entropy biosignals, respectively. The anaesthesiologist detected EMG on the monitor in 7/14 patients with BIS (sensitivity 50%) and in 4/13 patients with Entropy (31%). The clinical neurophysiologist detected EMG in 6/14 (43%) patients with BIS and in 5/13 (38%) with Entropy. The specificity of the EMG analyses was 55 and 65% with BIS, and 85 and 90% with Entropy. EMG arousal was detected in BIS biosignal in 10/17 and 4/17 patients with 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg doses of rocuronium (P = 0.04).

Our study compared entropy with classical bispectral index (BIS) in reduction of myoelectrical interference and noxious stimuli with EEG signals.
Two hundred and eighty patients (ASA I-II, 18-60 years old) undergoing scheduled surgeries from seven medical centers were enrolled. Anesthesia induction was managed with propofol via the target-controlled infusion (TCI) system. The results of BIS, RE, SE, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded before anesthesia induction, at the moment of unconsciousness, before and 2 minutes after administration of muscle relaxant, and before and one and three minutes after the tracheal intubation.
The values of half maximum effective concentrations (EC50), 5% effective concentrations (EC05) and 95% effective concentrations (EC95) of propofol effect-site concentration at the onset of unconsciousness were 1.2 (1.1-1.3 µg/ml), 2.5 (2.4-2.5 µg/ml) and 3.7 (3.7-3.8 µg/ml), while those of the predicted plasma propofol concentration were 2.8 (2.7-2.9 µg/ml), 3.9 (3.8-3.9 µg/ml) and 4.9 (4.8-5.0 µg/ml), respectively. The values of BIS, SE and RE were 62, 59 and 63 when 50% of patients lost consciousness, and 79, 80, 85 and 42, 37, 44, respectively, when 5% and 95% of patients were unconscious. The values of BIS, RE and SE dropped two minutes after the injection of muscle relaxant, but there were no significant differences between RE and SE. MAP and HR increased visibly, which indicated a reaction to tracheal intubation; the values of BIS, RE and SE, however, did not display any significant changes.
This large-sample multicentric study confirmed the values of RE and SE as approximating BIS value, at the onset of unconsciousness during propofol TCI anesthesia.

22594406,The EEG signal: a window on the cortical brain activity.,Paediatric anaesthesia,2012,"Constant I, Sabourdin N","The accurate assessment of the depth of anesthesia, allowing a more accurate adaptation of the doses of hypnotics, is an important end point for the anesthesiologist. It is a particularly crucial issue in pediatric anesthesia, in the context of the recent controversies about the potential neurological consequences of the main anesthetic drugs on the developing brain. The electroencephalogram signal reflects the electrical activity of the neurons in the cerebral cortex. It is thus the key to assessment of the level of hypnosis. Beyond visual analysis, several monitoring devices allow an automated treatment of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal, combining time and frequency domain analysis. Each of these monitors focuses on a specific combination of characteristics of the signal and provides the clinician with useful information that remains, however, partial. For a comprehensive approach of the EEG-derived indices, the main features of the normal EEG, in adults and children, will be presented in the awake state and during sleep. Age-related modifications accompanying cerebral maturation during infancy and childhood will be detailed. Then, this review will provide an update on how anesthetic drugs, particularly hypnotics, influence the EEG signal, and how the main available monitors analyze these drug-induced modifications. The relationships between pain, memory, and the EEG will be discussed. Finally, this review will focus on some specific EEG features such as the electrical epileptoid activity observed under sevoflurane anesthesia. The EEG signal is the best window we have on cortical brain activity and provides a fair pharmacodynamic feedback of the effects of hypnotics. However, the cortex is only one of several targets of anesthesia. Hypnotics and opiates, have also subcortical primary targets, and the EEG performances in the evaluation or prediction of nociception are poor. Monitoring subcortical structures in combination with the EEG might in the future allow a better evaluation and a more precise adaptation of balanced anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22594406/

We analyzed source-reconstructed data from frontal and parietal cortices during normal wakefulness, propofol-induced mild sedation, and loss of consciousness. Bayesian model selection revealed that the best model for explaining spectral changes across the three states involved changes in corticothalamic interactions. Compared with wakefulness, mild sedation was accounted for by an increase in thalamic excitability, which did not further increase during loss of consciousness. In contrast, loss of consciousness per se was accompanied by a decrease in backward corticocortical connectivity from frontal to parietal cortices, while thalamocortical connectivity remained unchanged. These results emphasize the importance of recurrent corticocortical communication in the maintenance of consciousness and suggest a direct effect of propofol on cortical dynamics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22593076/

To calculate an index representing the anesthetic level, these monitors have different time delays until the correct index is displayed. In previous studies, intraoperatively recorded real and simulated EEG signals were used to determine time delays of cerebral state and Narcotrend and Bispectral indices. In the present study, we determined time delays of state entropy and index of consciousness. For this purpose, recorded real and simulated EEG sequences representing different anesthetic levels were played back to the tested monitors. Simulated and real perioperatively recorded EEG signals indicating stable states ""awake,"" ""general anesthesia,"" and ""cortical suppression"" were used to evaluate the time delays. Time delays were measured when switching from one state to another and were defined as the required time span of the monitor to reach the stable target index. Comparable results were obtained using simulated and real EEG sequences. Time delays were not constant and ranged from 18 to 152 seconds. They were also different for increasing and decreasing values. Time delays were dependent on starting and target index values. Time delays of index calculation may limit the investigated monitor's ability to prevent interoperative awareness with recall. Different time delays for increasing and decreasing transitions could be a problem if the monitors are used for pharmacodynamic studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22584557/
22584553,The impact of nitrous oxide on electroencephalographic bicoherence during isoflurane anesthesia.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2012,"Hagihira S, Takashina M, Mori T, Mashimo T","We previously reported that electroencephalographic (EEG) bicoherence, the degree of phase coupling among the frequency components of a signal, showed 2 peaks during isoflurane anesthesia. Hayashi et al. (Br J Anaesth 2007;99:389-95) also revealed that the peak frequency of bicoherence around 10 Hz increased when ketamine was added. Because nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and ketamine share several common features, they are often treated as the same category of anesthetic. Here, we investigated the effect of N(2)O on EEG bicoherence and other EEG derivatives during isoflurane anesthesia.
Twenty patients (aged 34-72 years, ASA physical status I and II) of either gender who underwent elective laparoscopic surgery were included. Raw EEG data, along with EEG-derived parameters, were recorded using an A-1050 Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor and our self-authored Bispectral Analyzer for BIS software. We compared 2 peaks of EEG bicoherence (pBIC-low, around 4 Hz; and pBIC-high, around 10 Hz), as well as BIS and spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF95). Anesthesia was induced with 3 mg · kg(-1) thiopental and 3 μg · kg(-1) fentanyl. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (expired concentration at 1.0%), oxygen, and nitrogen. Fentanyl was added and maintained at an estimated effect-site concentration of >1.5 ng · mL(-1). We obtained baseline data 1 hour after induction of anesthesia, then 70% N(2)O was added for 30 minutes.
Before N(2)O, pBIC-low and pBIC-high were 49.3% ± 8.3% and 42.4% ± 11.0%. Ten minutes after starting N(2)O, pBIC-high decreased to 14.9% ± 5.9% (P < 0.001), and it was statistically significantly lower throughout the N(2)O period. Meanwhile, pBIC-low transiently decreased to 37.2% ± 12.8% (P = 0.01) during the early phase of N(2)O administration. Before N(2)O, BIS and SEF95 were 43.2 ± 4.9 and 13.1 ± 2.0 Hz, respectively. Both BIS and SEF95 slightly but statistically significantly decreased during N(2)O administration. Fifteen minutes after starting N(2)O, BIS and SEF95 were 35.7 ± 6.2 (P < 0.001) and 8.6 ± 1.8 Hz (P < 0.001) and they decreased more when large δ waves emerged. Fifteen minutes after stopping N(2)O, BIS, SEF95, as well as pBIC-low and pBIC-high returned to pre-N(2)O values.
Dissimilar to the effect of ketamine, N(2)O significantly decreases pBIC-high during isoflurane anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22584553/
22575174,"Measuring the hypnotic depth of anaesthesia based on the EEG signal using combined wavelet transform, eigenvector and normalisation techniques.",Computers in biology and medicine,2012,"Nguyen-Ky T, Wen P, Li Y, Malan M","This paper presents a new index to measure the hypnotic depth of anaesthesia (DoA) using EEG signals. This index is derived from applying combined Wavelet transform, eigenvector and normalisation techniques. The eigenvector method is first applied to build a feature function for six levels of coefficients in a discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The best Daubechies wavelet and their ranking value p are optimally determined to identify different states of anaesthesia. A statistic normalisation process is then carried out to re-scale data and compute the hypnotic depth of anaesthesia. Finally, a new function ZDoA is proposed to compute a DoA index which corresponds one of the five depths of anaesthesia states to very deep anaesthesia, deep anaesthesia, moderate anaesthesia, light anaesthesia and awake. Simulation results based on real anaesthetised EEGs demonstrate that the new index generally parallels the BIS index. In particular, the ZDoA index is often faster than the BIS index to react to the transition period between consciousness and unconsciousness for this data set. A Bland-Altman plot indicates a 95.23% agreement between the ZDoA and BIS indices. The ZDoA trend is responsive, and its movement is consistent with the clinically observed and recorded changes of the patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22575174/

Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and fentanyl and/or caudal block. At four points of sevoflurane concentration (0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%), 90% spectral edge frequency (SEF90), burst suppression ratio (BSR), relative beta ratio (RBR) and approximate entropy (ApEn) were analyzed.

Delivering appropriate dosages of sedative agents, to individual PIC patients, is important to reduce the many risks of over- or under-sedation. Although based on adult anaesthesia, DoAMs could offer increased objectivity to the titration of sedative agents for children in PIC. This article synthesises the current available evidence from studies investigating DoAM use in the PIC environment.
Literature regarding DoAM use in PIC was reviewed, from 1996 and August 2011, after EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Database were searched using key search terms.
Fourteen original research articles addressing sedation assessment using DoAMs in PIC were identified. The main findings were that DoAMs generally have a moderate or poor correlation with sedation scores and their performance varies in varying clinical settings. DoAMs do not make reliable conclusions about depth of sedation of individual PIC children, and can be influenced by children's age.
Evidence to support DoAMs in the PIC setting is currently not sufficient to advocate their routine use in clinical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22537477/

Analgesics drugs are used to control pain from surgical incisions, drainages, vascular access or endotracheal suctioning. Sedatives are used to facilitate the delivery of nursing care, to facilitate mechanical ventilation, prevent self-extubation and to minimize patient discomfort. A therapeutic plan for analgesia and sedation should be established for each patient and regularly reviewed. The most often used sedation agents in PICU patients are Morphine or Fentanyl alone or in combination with Midazolam. Several other drugs should be helpful to manage PICU patients therefore techniques like regional anesthesia and patient controlled analgesia to decrease the use of intravenous analgesia and sedation and to reduce the incidence of withdrawal syndrome. The therapeutic plan for analgesia and sedation should be established for each patient and regularly reviewed. Doses of sedative agents should be titrated to produce the desired level of sedation. The level of sedation should be regularly assessed and documented using few validated sedation assessment tool. However, behavioral evaluation tools based on patient responsiveness, cannot be used during the administration of neuromuscular blocking agents. Under this conditions it could be difficult to interpret the degree of sedation.

22457797,EEG-based automatic classification of 'awake' versus 'anesthetized' state in general anesthesia using Granger causality.,PloS one,2012,"Nicolaou N, Hourris S, Alexandrou P, Georgiou J","General anesthesia is a reversible state of unconsciousness and depression of reflexes to afferent stimuli induced by administration of a ""cocktail"" of chemical agents. The multi-component nature of general anesthesia complicates the identification of the precise mechanisms by which anesthetics disrupt consciousness. Devices that monitor the depth of anesthesia are an important aide for the anesthetist. This paper investigates the use of effective connectivity measures from human electrical brain activity as a means of discriminating between 'awake' and 'anesthetized' state during induction and recovery of consciousness under general anesthesia.
Granger Causality (GC), a linear measure of effective connectivity, is utilized in automated classification of 'awake' versus 'anesthetized' state using Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines (with linear and non-linear kernel). Based on our investigations, the most characteristic change of GC observed between the two states is the sharp increase of GC from frontal to posterior regions when the subject was anesthetized, and reversal at recovery of consciousness. Features derived from the GC estimates resulted in classification of 'awake' and 'anesthetized' states in 21 patients with maximum average accuracies of 0.98 and 0.95, during loss and recovery of consciousness respectively. The differences in linear and non-linear classification are not statistically significant, implying that GC features are linearly separable, eliminating the need for a complex and computationally expensive non-linear classifier. In addition, the observed GC patterns are particularly interesting in terms of a physiological interpretation of the disruption of consciousness by anesthetics. Bidirectional interaction or strong unidirectional interaction in the presence of a common input as captured by GC are most likely related to mechanisms of information flow in cortical circuits.
GC-based features could be utilized effectively in a device for monitoring depth of anesthesia during surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22457797/

Knowledge of infants' electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to anaesthetics is fragmentary. An earlier pilot study suggested amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) may be a useful measure of anaesthetic effect. The aim of this study was to determine how aEEG changes between awake and anaesthetised children of varying ages and to compare the response to that seen with Spectral Edge Frequency 90% (SEF90). A prospective observational study of children receiving a general anaesthetic was conducted. Anaesthetic regimen remained at the discretion of the treating anaesthetist. EEG data were collected using the BrainZ ReBrim(TM) monitor using forehead and biparietal montages. SEF90 and aEEG were compared across age groups, EEG montage and between awake and anaesthetised states. A total of 178 children (aged 24 days to 14 years) were recruited. All aEEGs were greater during anaesthesia compared to when awake and this difference varied with age. Only children older than two years showed lower SEF90 while anaesthetised compared to when awake. SEF90 from children younger than six months was higher during anaesthesia compared to when awake. Analysis of parietal and forehead EEG montages revealed age-related differences. These findings suggest that SEF90 and aEEG can discriminate between awake and anaesthetised states in older children. In younger children aEEG changes are less pronounced and SEF90 either cannot discriminate between states or responds paradoxically. The aEEG may be marginally better than other EEG parameters in measuring anaesthetic depth in children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22417022/
22404496,Measuring the effects of sevoflurane on electroencephalogram using sample entropy.,Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,2012,"Shalbaf R, Behnam H, Sleigh J, Voss L","Monitoring the effect of anesthetic drugs on the neural system is a major ongoing challenge for anesthetists. During the past few years, several electroencephalogram (EEG)-based methods such as the response entropy (RE) as implemented in the Datex-Ohmeda M-Entropy Module have been proposed. In this paper, sample entropy is used to quantify the predictability of EEG series, which could provide an index to show the effect of sevoflurane anesthesia. The dose-response relation of sample entropy is compared with that of RE.
EEG data from 21 subjects is collected during the induction of general anesthesia with sevoflurane. The sample entropy is applied to the EEG recording. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and prediction probability statistic are used to evaluate the efficiency of sample entropy in comparison with RE.
Both methods track the gross changes in EEG, especially the occurrence of burst-suppression pattern at high doses of anesthetics. However, our method produces faster reaction to transients in EEG during the induction of anesthesia as indicated from the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeled parameters and analysis around the point of loss of consciousness. Also, sample entropy correlated more closely with effect-site sevoflurane concentration than the RE. In addition, our proposed method exhibits greater resistance to noise in the EEG signals.
The results demonstrate that sample entropy can estimate the sevoflurane drug effect on the EEG more effectively than the commercial RE index with a stronger noise resistance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22404496/
22394672,Meanfield modeling of propofol-induced changes in spontaneous EEG rhythms.,NeuroImage,2012,"Hindriks R, van Putten MJ","During the maintenance period of propofol-induced general anesthesia, specific changes in spontaneous EEG rhythms can be observed. These comprise increased delta and theta power and the emergence of alpha oscillations over frontal regions. In this study we use a meanfield model of the thalamo-cortical system to reproduce these changes and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The model is able to reproduce the most dominant changes in the EEG and suggests that they are caused by the amplification of resonances within the thalamo-cortical system. Specifically, while observed increases in delta and alpha power are reflections of amplified resonances in the respective frequency bands, increases in theta power are caused indirectly by spectral power leakage from delta and alpha bands. The model suggests that these changes are brought about through increased inhibition within local cortical interneuron circuits. These results are encouraging and motivate more extensive use of neural meanfield models in elucidating the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of pharmacological agents on macroscopic brain dynamics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22394672/

In addition, propofol concentration in exhaled breath is tightly correlated with propofol concentration in plasma. Therefore, real-time monitoring of expiratory propofol could be useful for titrating intravenous anesthesia, but only if concentration changes in plasma can be determined in exhaled breath without significant delay. To evaluate the utility of IMR-MS during non-steady-state conditions, we measured the time course of both expiratory propofol concentration and the processed electroencephalography (EEG) as a surrogate outcome for propofol effect after an IV bolus induction of propofol. Twenty-one patients scheduled for routine surgery were observed after a bolus of 2.5 mg kg(-1) propofol for induction of anesthesia. Expiratory propofol was measured using IMR-MS and the cerebral propofol effect was estimated using the bispectral index (BIS). Primary endpoints were time to detection of expiratory propofol and time to onset of propofol's effect on BIS, and the secondary endpoint was time to peak effect (highest expiratory propofol or lowest BIS). Expiratory propofol and changes in BIS were first detected at 43 ± 21 and 49 ± 11 s after bolus injection, respectively (P = 0.29). Peak propofol concentrations (9.2 ± 2.4 parts-per-billion) and lowest BIS values (23 ± 4) were reached after 208 ± 57 and 219 ± 62 s, respectively (P = 0.57). Expiratory propofol concentrations measured by IMR-MS have similar times to detection and peak concentrations compared with propofol effect as measured by the processed EEG (BIS). This suggests that expiratory propofol concentrations may be useful for titrating intravenous anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22370587/

It could be done in real time for neuromuscular blockers (NMB) using measured values of effect. This study was designed to assess feasibility and benefit of Bayesian forecasting during a rocuronium target-controlled infusion (TCI).
After internal review board (IRB) approval and informed consent, 21 women scheduled for breast plastic surgery were included. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol, alfentanil, and controlled ventilation through a laryngeal mask. Rocuronium was delivered in TCI with Stanpump software and the Plaud population model. The target effect was 50% blockade until insertion of breast prosthesis; thereafter it was set to 0%. Response to train of four (TOF) at adductor pollicis was recorded using a force transducer. In ten patients, drug delivery was based on the population model. In the others, repeated measures values were entered in the software, and the PK model was adjusted to minimize the error in predicted effect. Model precision was compared between groups using mean prediction error and mean absolute prediction error.
At target 50%, model accuracy was not improved with Bayesian adjustments; conversely, post-infusion errors were significantly decreased. The first two measures had the most influence on the model changes.
Below clinical utility, such adjustments may be used to explore cofactors influencing interindividual and intraindividual variability in NMB dose-response relationship. Similar tools may also be developed for drugs in which a quantitative effect is available, such as electroencephalography (EEG) for hypnotics.

It is characteristic of an inactivated brain and is commonly observed at deep levels of general anesthesia, hypothermia, and in pathological conditions such as coma and early infantile encephalopathy. We propose a unifying mechanism for burst suppression that accounts for all of these conditions. By constructing a biophysical computational model, we show how the prevailing features of burst suppression may arise through the interaction between neuronal dynamics and brain metabolism. In each condition, the model suggests that a decrease in cerebral metabolic rate, coupled with the stabilizing properties of ATP-gated potassium channels, leads to the characteristic epochs of suppression. Consequently, the model makes a number of specific predictions of experimental and clinical relevance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22323592/

We compared BIS values before and after sugammadex or neostigmine neuromuscular block (NMB) reversal in patients with or without high EMG activity.
During stable propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia and rocuronium-induced block, 48 patients were randomly allocated to receive sugammadex 4 mg kg(-1) or neostigmine 50 μg kg(-1)/glycopyrrolate 10 μg kg(-1), 10 min after the end of surgery.
Five minutes after sugammadex administration, mean BIS 50.1 (10.3) increased (P=0.018) to 61.7 (7.9) in 11 patients with high EMG activity. In contrast, BIS 49.3 (4.9) remained at 51.9 (5.4) in 13 patients who had no EMG activity.

However, in 11 patients who had no EMG activity, BIS 52.3 (7.4) remained at 53.3 (6.8). There was no significant difference between the sugammadex and neostigmine groups over time.
We have shown that reversal of NMB with sugammadex or neostigmine increased BIS values dependent on the presence of EMG activity.

EEG data of 40 patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia with either sevoflurane/remifentanil or propofol/remifentanil were replayed to an EEG player and reanalysed by a BIS A-2000® monitor and a Cerebral State Monitor. Further, research into differences between CSI and BIS index values was performed, e.g., extraction of differences of ≥ 10 and ≥ 20 index points and of the EEG length with differing index values.
The overall correlation coefficient was 0.68 without significant difference between propofol or sevoflurane group. In 51.8% of all recordings, both EEG monitors agreed in their classification of the anesthetic level. The number and length of differing index pairs was influenced by varying time delays of index calculation and different algorithms of index computation.
In contrast to previous studies, our current approach combines the following conditions: analysis on basis of identical underlying EEG data from deep to light anesthesia, no guidance of anesthetic administration by one of the EEG-based monitors, avoidance of simultaneous EEG readings and the use of two different anesthetic regimens. Though the result of EEG analysis during anesthesia is similar with both monitors, CSI performance during propofol anesthesia was superior to sevoflurane anesthesia. Consequently, a lower agreement of classification of anesthetic levels between BIS and CSI was reached with the use of sevoflurane.

Thirty patients undergoing gynecological operations were studied. Patients were anesthetized with target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil, and rocuronium was used to induce NMB. After operation, during light propofol-remifentanil anesthesia, NMB was antagonized with sugammadex or neostigmine. During the following 5 min, the numerical values of BIS, BIS electromyographic (BIS EMG) and Entropy were recorded on a laptop computer, as well as the biosignal recorded by the Entropy strip. The Entropy biosignal was studied off-line both in time and frequency domain to see if NMB reversal causes changes in EEG.
In some patients, administration of sugammadex or neostigmine caused a significant rise in the numerical values of BIS, BIS EMG and Entropy. This phenomenon was most likely caused by increased electromyographic (EMG) activity. The administration of sugammadex or neostigmine appeared to have only minimal effect on EEG.
The EMG contamination of EEG causes BIS and Entropy values to rise during reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB in light propofol-remifentanil anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22289106/
22273803,Using the Hilbert-Huang transform to measure the electroencephalographic effect of propofol.,Physiological measurement,2012,"Shalbaf R, Behnam H, Sleigh JW, Voss LJ","Monitoring the effect of anesthetic drugs on the central nervous system is a major ongoing challenge in anesthesia research. A number of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based monitors of the anesthetic drug effect such as the bispectral (BIS) index have been proposed to analyze the EEG signal during anesthesia. However, the BIS index has received some criticism. This paper offers a method based on the Hilbert-Huang transformation to calculate an index, called the Hilbert-Huang weighted regional frequency (HHWRF), to quantify the effect of propofol on brain activity. The HHWRF and BIS indices are applied to EEG signals collected from nine patients during a controlled propofol induction and emergence scheme. The results show that both the HHWRF and BIS track the gross changes in the EEG with increasing and decreasing anesthetic drug effect (the prediction probability P(k) of 0.85 and 0.83 for HHWRF and BIS, respectively). Our new index can reflect the transition from unconsciousness to consciousness faster than the BIS, as indicated from the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeled parameters and also from the analysis around the point of reawakening. This method could be used to design a new EEG monitoring system to estimate the propofol anesthetic drug effect.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22273803/

We prospectively studied 102 patients receiving propofol-sufentanil anaesthesia administered by anaesthetists blinded to these indices. The main endpoint was crude agreement (P(0)), defined as the proportion of agreement between BIS and SE index among three categories: <40, between 40 and 60, and >60. Discrepancies in recommendation (DR) were also considered. A DR is type 1 if BIS or SE is <40, while the other is simultaneously >60. A DR is type 2 when BIS and SE index values are on different sides of a threshold (40 or 60) with three subtypes according to the magnitude of their difference. A linear multiple regression was performed to identify covariates that are independently associated with P(0).
In total, 12 147 pairs of values were studied. P(0) was 59.9 (24.5%) [mean (sd)]. Thirty-three patients presented more than 50% discordant pairs and only seven patients presented more than 95% concordant pairs. Type 1 DR occurred in only 1.1% of all the pairs. The median (inter-quartile range) number of type 2 DR varied from 5 (3-8) to 2 (1-3) according to the degree of difference. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P=0.0004) and electrode position (P=0.0084) were independently associated with P(0). An increase in the age of 10 yr decreases P(0) by 5%.
The agreement between BIS and SE indices is moderate and deteriorates as patients' age increases. This study cannot determine which index is best adapted for elderly patients. Additional work comparing both indices with raw EEG traces is warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22258203/

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,2011,"Brás S, Ferreira DA, Antunes L, Ribeiro L, Nunes CS, Gouveia S","Cerebral State Index (CSI) is a measure of depth of anesthesia (DoA) developed for humans, which is traditionally modeled with the Hill equation and the propofol effect-site concentration (Ce). The CSI has been studied in dogs and showed several limitations related to the interpretation of EEG data. Nevertheless, the CSI has a lot of potential for DoA monitoring in dogs, it just needs to be adjusted for this species. In this work, an adapted CSI model is presented for dogs considering a) both Ce and EMG as inputs and b) a fuzzy logic structure with parameters optimized using the ANFIS method. The new model is compared with traditional Hill model using data from dogs in routine surgery. The results showed no significant impact in the model performance with the change of model structure (Fuzzy instead of Hill). The residuals of the Hill model were significantly correlated with the EMG, indicating that the latter should be considered in the model. In fact, the EMG introduction in CSI model significantly decreased the modeling error: 11.8 [8.6; 15.2] (fuzzy logic) versus 20.9 [16.4; 29.0] (Hill). This work shows that CSI modeling in dogs can be improved using the current human anesthesia set-up, once the EMG signal is acquired simultaneously with the CSI index. However, it does not invalidate the search of new DoA indices more adjusted to use in dog's anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22255850/

Existing empirical data clearly shows that such ""microscopic"" pharmacological diversity is reflected in their ""macroscopic"" effects on the human electroencephalogram (EEG). Based on a detailed mesoscopic neural field model we theoretically posit that anesthetic induced EEG activity is due to selective parametric changes in synaptic efficacy and dynamics. Specifically, on the basis of physiologically constrained modeling, it is speculated that the selective modification of inhibitory or excitatory synaptic activity may differentially effect the EEG spectrum. Such results emphasize the importance of neural field theories of brain electrical activity for elucidating the principles whereby pharmacological agents effect the EEG.

A combination of fentanyl and propofol (± rocuronium) was used for induction and a Sevoflurane in air/O(2) mixture was administered through an endotracheal tube to achieve the steady minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). This study showed that 0 to 4 Hz signal power was most sensitive to the changes associated with induction of anesthesia whereas the 4 to 12 Hz power was important in classifying states during maintenance of anesthesia. Anesthesia also promoted heightened phase coherence in 8 to 16 Hz and 16 to 30 Hz ranges during maintenance and induction of anesthesia, respectively.

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,2011,"Mukamel EA, Wong KF, Prerau MJ, Brown EN, Purdon PL","The state of general anesthesia (GA) is associated with an increase in spectral power in scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) at frequencies below 40 Hz, including spectral peaks in the slow oscillation (SO, 0.1-1 Hz) and α (8-14 Hz) bands. Because conventional power spectral analyses are insensitive to possible cross-frequency coupling, the relationships among the oscillations at different frequencies remain largely unexplored. Quantifying such coupling is essential for improving clinical monitoring of anesthesia and understanding the neuroscience of this brain state. We tested the usefulness of two measures of cross-frequency coupling: the bispectrum-derived SynchFastSlow, which is sensitive to phase-phase coupling in different frequency bands, and modulogram analysis of coupling between SO phase and α rhythm amplitude. SynchFastSlow, a metric that is used in clinical depth-of-anesthesia monitors, showed a robust correlation with the loss of consciousness at the induction of propofol GA, but this could be largely explained by power spectral changes without considering cross-frequency coupling. Modulogram analysis revealed two distinct modes of cross-frequency coupling under GA. The waking and two distinct states under GA could be discriminated by projecting in a two-dimensional phase space defined by the SynchFastSlow and the preferred SO phase of α activity. Our results show that a stereotyped pattern of phase-amplitude coupling accompanies multiple stages of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. These findings suggest that modulogram analysis can improve EEG based monitoring of brain state under GA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22254722/

In addition to standard and advanced monitors typically used during cardiac surgery, anesthesiologists may consider monitoring the brain with raw or processed electroencephalography (EEG). There is strong evidence that a protocol incorporating the processed EEG bispectral index (BIS) decreases the incidence intraoperative awareness in comparison with standard practice. However, there is conflicting evidence that incorporating the BIS into cardiac anesthesia practice improves ""fast-tracking,"" decreases anesthetic drug use, or detects cerebral ischemia. Recent research, including many cardiac surgical patients, shows that a protocol based on BIS monitoring is not superior to a protocol based on end-tidal anesthetic concentration monitoring in preventing awareness. There has been a resurgence of interest in the anesthesia literature in limited montage EEG monitoring, including nonproprietary processed indices. This has been accompanied by research showing that with structured training, anesthesiologists can glean useful information from the raw EEG trace.

Recent theoretical developments emphasize changes in directed functional (i.e., causal) connectivity as reflected in quantities such as 'integrated information' and 'causal density'. Here we develop and illustrate a rigorous methodology for assessing causal connectivity from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals using Granger causality (GC). Our method addresses the challenges of non-stationarity and bias by dividing data into short segments and applying permutation analysis. We apply the method to EEG data obtained from subjects undergoing propofol-induced anaesthesia, with signals source-localized to the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. We found significant increases in bidirectional GC in most subjects during loss-of-consciousness, especially in the beta and gamma frequency ranges. Corroborating a previous analysis we also found increases in synchrony in these ranges; importantly, the Granger causality analysis showed higher inter-subject consistency than the synchrony analysis. Finally, we validate our method using simulated data generated from a model for which GC values can be analytically derived. In summary, our findings advance the methodology of Granger causality analysis of EEG data and carry implications for integrated information and causal density theories of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22242156/

Electroencephalogram (EEG) can measure intraoperative burst suppression as evidence of cerebral metabolic suppression, but EEG is not always available during clip ligation. This study was conducted to compare the effect of propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with sevoflurane-based inhalational anesthesia on thiopental-induced burst suppression during aneurysm surgery. The effect of thiopental was measured by burst suppression ratio (BSR) using the bispectral index (BIS) monitor.
Forty-six patients who underwent temporary clipping during aneurysm surgery were randomized into 2 groups. The inhalation group (n=21) received sevoflurane-N(2)O anesthesia and the TIVA group (n=25) received propofol-remifenatanil-N(2)O anesthesia. The anesthesia level maintained a BIS value between 40 and 55. Pharmacological burst suppression was induced with bolus administration of thiopental (5 mg/kg) before temporary clipping. The BIS number, BSR values, the onset time and duration of BSR, and hemodynamic variables were recorded every minute in both groups.
There were no significant differences between groups in the onset time of burst suppression (P=0.394) and BIS changes (P=0.878). However, statistically significant longer duration (P<0.001) and significantly higher degree of burst suppression (P=0.006) were observed in the TIVA group compared with the inhalation group.
Our results suggest that at equivalent BIS values TIVA with propofol anesthesia provides longer duration and greater cerebral metabolic suppression compared with sevoflurane-N(2)O inhalation anesthesia. BIS may be an acceptable alternative to standard EEG monitoring when assessing burst suppression during temporary clipping.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22210231/

However, its clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) sedative effects are not yet described in children. The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to assess clinical and EEG effects of increasing intravenous (IV) doses of GHB in burn children requiring sedation for burn wound cares.
Thirty six children hospitalized in a burn care unit were included and randomly assigned into three groups (G) according to the single IV dose of GHB they received before burn wound care: 10 mg · kg(-1) in G10, 25 mg · kg(-1) in G25, or 50 mg · kg(-1) in G50. All patients received oral premedication (morphine and hydroxyzine) 30 min before GHB injection. Respiratory rate, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index (BIS) were continuously monitored. Depth of sedation was clinically assessed using Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS) Score, every 2 min until recovery (i.e., OAAS = 4).
Median age was 17.5 [12-34] months. Whatever the dose, BIS decreased after IV GHB. Nadir value of BIS was significantly lower in G25 and G50 than in G10, as was for OAAS score. Nadir values were reached after same delays in G25 and G50. Duration of sedation was dose-dependent.
Bispectral index decreased after GHB injection and was correlated with OAAS score. Deep sedation can be safely achieved with IV doses of 25 or 50 mg · kg(-1), but the last dose was associated with prolonged duration of clinical sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22151064/

Compared to traditional pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models, the proposed model has structural parsimony and comparable predictive capability, making it more attractive than its PKPD counterpart for identifying an individualized dose-response model in real-time. The efficacy of the direct dynamic dose-response model over a traditional PKPD model was assessed using a mixed effects modeling analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG)-based state entropty (SE) response to intravenous propofol administration in 34 pediatric subjects.

In this study we applied the HE index, extracted from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, as a measure of anesthetic drug effects on brain activity.
In 19 adult patients undergoing sevoflurane general anesthesia, we calculated the HE of the raw EEG; comparing the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) with the traditional rescaled range (R/S) analysis techniques, and with a commercial index of depth of anesthesia - the response entropy (RE). We analyzed each wavelet-decomposed sub-band as well as the combined low frequency bands (HEOLFBs). The methods were compared in regard to pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling, and prediction probability.
All the low frequency band HE indices decreased when anesthesia deepened.

21919375,Unexpected entropy response to saline spraying at the end of posterior fossa surgery: a few cases report.,Acta anaesthesiologica Belgica,2011,"Clanet M, Bonhomme V, Lhoest L, Born JD, Hans P","The Spectral Entropy proposed to monitor the depth of anesthesia includes the State Entropy (SE) computed from the EEG (0.8-32 Hz frequency band), and the Response Entropy (RE) computed from EEG and facial muscles activity (0.5-47 Hz frequency band). We report an unexpected Entropy response to saline spraying at the end of posterior fossa surgery. Six patients undergoing scheduled functional surgery of the posterior fossa were included in this report. They were anesthetized with propofol and remifentanil using TCI and received an intubation dose of rocuronium. At the end of surgery, saline spraying, performed for hemostatic purpose and wreckage elimination, resulted in a sustained increase in RE and SE without hemodynamic modification in four patients, while no change was observed in the two other ones. In one of the responding patients, 0.1 mg kg(-1) rocuronium attenuated the Entropy response. In the two non responders, repetition of spraying or rocuronium administration did not change Entropy value. Recovery from anesthesia was comparable in all patients and none of them complained from awareness. We conclude that Entropy can increase during posterior fossa surgery in non-paralyzed patients. This response probably reflects an increase in facial muscle activity rather than a change in depth of anesthesia, as far as it can be attenuated by a small dose of rocuronium. While this hypothesis requires further investigation, these observations suggest that saline spraying may confound interpretation of Entropy during posterior fossa surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21919375/
21906905,Shunting during carotid endarterectomy.,Journal of vascular surgery,2011,"Aburahma AF, Mousa AY, Stone PA","The use of shunting during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is controversial. While some surgeons advocate routine shunting, others prefer selective shunting or no shunting. Several large series have documented excellent results of CEA with routine shunting or without shunts. Others reported similar results with selective shunting using transcranial Doppler (TCD), electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, carotid stump pressure (SP), cervical block anesthesia (CBA), and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP). In this study, we review the available evidence supporting shunting, nonshunting, and selective shunting during CEA.
An electronic PubMed/MEDLINE search was conducted to identify all published CEA studies between January 1990 and December 2010, that analyzed the perioperative outcome of routine shunting, routine nonshunting, routine versus selective shunting, selecting shunting versus avoiding a shunt, and selective shunting based on EEG, TCD, SP, CBA, and SSEP.
The mean reported perioperative stroke rate for CEAs with routine shunting was 1.4% and for routine nonshunt was 2%. Meanwhile, the mean perioperative stroke rates for selecting shunting were 1.6% using EEG, 4.8% using TCD, 1.6% using SP, 1.8% using SSEP, and 1.1% for CBA. Similar results were noted for perioperative stroke and death rates.
The use of routine shunting and selective shunting was associated with a low stroke rate. Both methods are acceptable, and the individual surgeon should select the method with which they are more comfortable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21906905/

Our goal was to determine if titrating sevoflurane as the maintenance anesthetic to a depth of anesthesia monitor (SEDLine™, Masimo, CA) would shorten time to extubation in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery while on beta-adrenergic blockade. This patient population was selected because the usual cardiovascular signs of inadequate general anesthesia may be masked by beta-blocker therapy.
Surgical patients older than 65 years of age receiving beta-adrenergic blockers for a minimum of 24 h preoperatively were randomized to two groups: a group whose titration of sevoflurane was based on SEDLine™ data (SEDLine™ group) and a group whose titration was based on usual clinical criteria (control group) where SEDLine™ data were concealed. The primary endpoint was time from skin closure to time to extubation. Aldrete score, White Fast Track score and QoR-40 were also assessed.
There was no significant difference in time to extubation [12.5 (SD 7.4) min in the control group versus 13.0 (SD 5.9) min for the treatment group]. The control group used more fentanyl [339 mcg (SD 205)] than did the treatment group [238 mcg (SD 123)] (P<0.02). There was no difference in sevoflurane utilization, Aldrete, White Fast Track scores, time to PACU discharge, or QoR-40 assessments between the groups.

It may occur during deep anaesthesia, but also in the case of metabolic or haemodynamic brain injury. The goal of the study was to describe the occurrence of SR and to determine factors associated with SR during propofol-remifentanil general anaesthesia maintenance.
We conducted a post hoc analysis of BIS recordings in consecutive patients included in two multi-centre trials, undergoing non-cardiac surgery using a dual closed-loop BIS controller allowing automated propofol-remifentanil administration. The percentage of time spent with a BIS value between 40 and 60 (T(BIS 40-60)) was measured. Two groups of patients were defined: the SR group, including patients with at least one episode of SR value >10% lasting more than 1 min, and the control group. Factors associated with SR were analysed using a stepwise multivariate analysis.
A total of 1494 patients [age=57 (17) yr; T(BIS 40-60)=76 (17%)] were analysed and 131 (8.7%) patients constituted the SR group. The main independent factors associated with SR were advanced age [odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=4.80 (1.85-12.43) (P=0.027), 10.59 (3.76-29.81) (P<0.0001), for categories of age 60-80 and >80 yr, respectively], history of coronary artery disease (CAD) [2.53 (1.47-4.37) (P=0.001)] and male gender [1.57 (1.03-2.40) (P=0.03)].

21824836,The effect of propofol-remifentanil anesthesia on selected seizure quality indices in electroconvulsive therapy.,Brain stimulation,2012,"Dinwiddie SH, Glick DB, Goldman MB","Use of a short-acting opiate to potentiate anesthetic induction agents has been shown to increase seizure duration in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), but little is known of the effect of this combination on indices of seizure quality.
To determine whether anesthetic modality affects commonly provided indices of seizure quality.
Twenty-five subjects were given propofol 2 mg/kg body weight for their first ECT session, at which time seizure threshold was titrated. Subjects thereafter alternated between that anesthetic regimen or propofol 0.5 mg/kg plus remifentanil 1 mcg/kg. Linear mixed models with random subject effect, adjusting for electrode placement, electrical charge, and number of treatments, were fit to estimate effect of anesthesia on seizure duration and several standard seizure quality indices (average seizure energy, time to peak electroencephalography (EEG) power, maximum sustained power, interhemispheric coherence, early and midictal EEG amplitude, and maximum sustained interhemispheric EEG coherence).
Propofol-remifentanil anesthesia significantly lengthened seizure duration and was associated with longer time to reach maximal EEG power and coherence as well as maximal degree of interhemispheric EEG coherence. No effect was seen on early ictal amplitude or average seizure energy index.
Propofol-remifentanil anesthesia prolongs seizure duration and has a significant effect on some, but not all, measures of seizure quality. This effect may be of some benefit in cases where adequate seizures are otherwise difficult to elicit. Varying anesthetic technique may allow more precise investigation of the relationships between and relative impacts of commonly used seizure quality indices on clinical outcomes and ECT-related cognitive side effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21824836/
21789744,NREM sleep staging using WAV(CNS) index.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2011,"Agrawal G, Modarres M, Zikov T, Bibian S","Visual scoring of 30-s epochs of sleep data is not always adequate to show the dynamic structure of sleep in sufficient details. It is also prone to considerable inter- and intra-rater variability. Moreover, it involves considerable training and experience, and is very tedious, time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly. Hence, automatic sleep staging is needed to overcome these limitations. Since naturally occurring NREM sleep and anesthesia have been reported to possess various underlying neurophysiological similarities, EEG-based depth-of-anesthesia monitors have started to penetrate into sleep research. This study investigates the ability of WAV(CNS) index (as implemented in NeuroSENSE depth-of-anesthesia monitor) to detect NREM sleep stages and wake state for full overnight PSG data.
Full overnight PSG sleep data, obtained from 24 adolescents, was scored by a registered PSG technologist for different sleep stages. Retrospective analysis was performed on a single frontal channel using the WAV(CNS) algorithm. Non-parametric descriptive statistics were used to examine the relationship between WAV(CNS) index and sleep stages.
A strong correlation (ρ = 0.9458) was found between the WAV(CNS) index and NREM sleep stages, with WAV(CNS) index values decreasing with increasing sleep stages. Moreover, there was no significant overlap between different NREM sleep stages as classified by the WAV(CNS) index, which was able to significantly differentiate (P < 0.001) between all pairs of Awake and different NREM stages.
This study demonstrates that changes in the depth of natural NREM sleep are reflected sensitively by changes in the WAV(CNS) index. Hence, WAV(CNS) index may serve as an automatic real-time indicator of depth of natural sleep with high temporal resolution, and can possibly be of great use for automated sleep staging in routine/postoperative somnographic studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21789744/
21788312,Nitrous oxide paradoxically modulates slow electroencephalogram oscillations: implications for anesthesia monitoring.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2011,"Foster BL, Liley DT","Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is one of the oldest analgesics/adjuvant agents still in use today; however, its effects on the human electroencephalogram (EEG) remain unclear. It has been proposed that N(2)O may enhance higher-frequency EEG activity (often indicative of alert states and cognition) duration sedation. This possibly paradoxical effect has been used to explain the failure of many EEG monitors to capture the effects of N(2)O on patient state during anesthesia. To better understand the poor efficacy of current EEG approaches to monitoring N(2)O action, we quantitatively studied the sole effect of N(2)O on the resting EEG in healthy volunteers using multichannel EEG recordings under noise-minimized laboratory conditions.
Healthy male volunteers were administered 20% (n = 10), 40% (n = 10), or 60% (n = 5) inspired N(2)O mixed with oxygen during noise-shielded EEG recordings. N(2)O was administered over a 20-minute period involving a 5-minute equilibration period and 5-minute washout. EEG spectral edge frequency (95%), median power frequency, total power, and band-limited power (δ, , α, β, and γ) were used as quantitative EEG parameters. The changes in these EEG parameters were quantified throughout N(2)O inhalation and compared between predrug baseline, peak drug effect, and washout.
Quantification of changes in spectral power during N(2)O inhalation showed only minor changes in estimates of spectral edge and median power frequency, whereas significant reductions in total power were observed at frontal sites during peak gas effect (P = 0.001; mean reduction [95% confidence interval]: 41.90 μV(2) [18.19-65.61 μV(2)]) that rebounded during N(2)O washout. Such changes in total power were driven by shifts in low-frequency power (δ/), which were most elevated at frontal sites.
Rather than directly enhancing high-frequency EEG power (β or γ bands), N(2)O seems to preserve the awake features of resting EEG (α band) and suppress power in those bands in which increases are typically associated with sedation/hypnosis (δ and ). These data suggest that N(2)O's suppression of low-frequency EEG power may help to explain previously reported difficulties in attempting to monitor patient state with the EEG during anesthesia involving N(2)O. Because increases in low-frequency power typically indicate increasing anesthesia, N(2)O's suppression of such activity and its rebound during washout would paradoxically influence EEG monitoring parameters. Therefore, correcting for such effects is expected to improve future monitoring methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21788312/

Acute deep brain macrostimulation intraoperative findings were sparsely published in the literature. We report on our intraoperative macrostimulation findings during thalamic and hippocampal DBS implantation.
Eighteen patients were studied. All patients underwent routine pre-operative evaluation that included clinical history, neurological examination, interictal and ictal EEG, high resolution 1.5T MRI and neuropsychological testing. Six patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were submitted to hippocampal DBS (Hip-DBS); 6 patients with focal epilepsy were submitted to anterior thalamic nucleus DBS (AN-DBS) and 6 patients with generalized epilepsy were submitted to centro-median thalamic nucleus DBS (CM-DBS). Age ranged from 9 to 40 years (11 males). All patients were submitted to bilateral quadripolar DBS electrode implantation in a single procedure, under general anesthesia, and intraoperative scalp EEG monitoring. Final electrode's position was checked postoperatively using volumetric CT scanning. Bipolar stimulation using the more proximal and distal electrodes was performed. Final standard stimulation parameters were 6Hz, 4V, 300μs (low frequency range: LF) or 130Hz, 4V, 300μs (high frequency range: HF).
Bilateral recruiting response (RR) was obtained after unilateral stimulation in all patients submitted to AN and CM-DBS using LF stimulation. RR was widespread but prevailed over the fronto-temporal region bilaterally, and over the stimulated hemisphere. HF stimulation led to background slowing and a DC shift. The mean voltage for the appearance of RR was 4V (CM) and 3V (AN). CM and AN-DBS did not alter inter-ictal spiking frequency or morphology. RR obtained after LF Hip-DBS was restricted to the stimulated temporal lobe and no contralateral activation was noted. HF stimulation yielded no visually recognizable EEG modification. Mean intensity for initial appearance of RR was 3V. In 5 of the 6 patients submitted to Hip-DBS, an increase in inter-ictal spiking was noted unilaterally immediately after electrode insertion. Intraoperative LF stimulation did not modify temporal lobe spiking; on the other hand, HF was effective in abolishing inter-ictal spiking in 4 of the 6 patients studied. There was no immediate morbidity or mortality in this series.
Macrostimulation might be used to confirm that the hardware was working properly. There was no typical RR derived from each studied thalamic nuclei after LF stimulation. On the other hand, absence of such RRs was highly suggestive of hardware malfunction or inadequate targeting. Thalamic-DBS (Th-DBS) RR was always bilateral after unilateral stimulation, although they somehow prevailed over the stimulated hemisphere. Contrary to Th-DBS, Hip-DBS gave rise to localized RR over the ipsolateral temporal neocortex, and absence of this response might very likely be related to inadequate targeting or hardware failure. Increased spiking was seen over temporal neocortex during hippocampal electrode insertion; this might point to the more epileptogenic hippocampal region in each individual patient. We did not notice any intraoperative response difference among patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with or without MTS. The relationship between these intraoperative findings and seizure outcome is not yet clear and should be further evaluated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21782475/

Prognostication is complicated since sedation and muscle relaxation are used and established indicators of a poor prognosis are lacking. This prospective, observational study describes the pattern of commonly used prognostic markers in a hypothermia-treated cohort of cardiac arrest patients with prolonged coma.
Among 111 consecutive patients, 19 died, 58 recovered, and 34 were in coma 3 days after normothermia (4.5 days after cardiac arrest), defined as prolonged coma. All patients were monitored with continuous amplitude-integrated EEG and repeated samples of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were collected. In patients with prolonged coma, somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and brain MRI were performed. A postmortem brain investigation was undertaken in patients who died.
Six of the 17 patients (35%) with NSE levels <33 μg/L at 48 hours regained the capacity to obey verbal commands. By contrast, all 17 patients with NSE levels >33 failed to recover consciousness. In the >33 NSE group, all 10 studied with MRI had extensive brain injury on diffusion-weighted images, 12/16 lacked cortical responses on SSEP, and all 6 who underwent autopsy had extensive severe histologic damage. NSE levels also correlated with EEG pattern, but less uniformly, since 11/17 with NSE <33 had an electrographic status epilepticus (ESE), only one of whom recovered. A continuous EEG pattern correlated to NSE <33 and awakening.
NSE correlates well with other markers of ischemic brain injury. In patients with no other signs of brain injury, postanoxic ESE may explain a poor outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21775743/

We studied whether they can differentiate consciousness from unconsciousness during increasing doses of three different anaesthetic agents.
Thirty healthy male volunteers aged 19-30 yr were recruited and divided into three 10-volunteer groups to receive either dexmedetomidine, propofol, or sevoflurane in escalating concentrations at 10 min intervals until loss of consciousness (LOC) was reached. Consciousness was tested at 5 min intervals and after drug discontinuation at 1 min intervals by requesting the subjects to open their eyes. LOC was defined as unresponsiveness to the request and pre-LOC as the last meaningful response. The first meaningful response to the request after drug discontinuation was defined as regaining of consciousness (ROC). For the statistical analysis, pre-LOC and ROC values were pooled to represent the responsive state while LOC values represented the unresponsive state. Prediction probability (P(K)) was estimated with the jack-knife method.
The lowest mean values for BIS, SE, and RE were recorded at LOC with all three drugs. The P(K) values were low for dexmedetomidine (BIS 0.62, SE 0.58, RE 0.59), propofol (BIS 0.73, SE 0.72, RE 0.72), and sevoflurane (BIS 0.70, SE 0.52, RE 0.62).

These BOLD fluctuations exhibit temporal synchrony within widely distributed brain regions known as resting-state networks. Resting-state networks are present in the waking state, during sleep, and under general anesthesia, suggesting that spontaneous neuronal activity plays a fundamental role in brain function. Despite its ubiquitous presence, the physiological role of correlated, spontaneous neuronal activity remains poorly understood. One hypothesis is that this activity is critical for the development of synaptic connections and maintenance of synaptic homeostasis. We had a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in a 5-y-old boy with severe epileptic encephalopathy. The child developed marked neurologic dysfunction in association with a seizure disorder, resulting in a 1-y period of behavioral regression and progressive loss of developmental milestones. His EEG showed a markedly abnormal pattern of high-amplitude, disorganized slow activity with frequent generalized and multifocal epileptiform discharges. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI showed reduced BOLD fluctuations and a pervasive lack of normal connectivity. The child underwent successful corpus callosotomy surgery for treatment of drop seizures. Postoperatively, the patient's behavior returned to baseline, and he resumed development of new skills. The waking EEG revealed a normal background, and functional connectivity MRI demonstrated restoration of functional connectivity architecture. These results provide evidence that intrinsic, coherent neuronal signaling may be essential to the development and maintenance of the brain's functional organization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21709227/

Although these analyses have suggested that different spatial patterns are associated with changes in the state of general anesthesia, the extent to which these patterns are spatially coordinated has not been systematically characterized. Global coherence, the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the sum of the eigenvalues of the cross-spectral matrix at a given frequency and time, has been used to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of multivariate time-series. Using 64-lead EEG recorded from human subjects receiving computer-controlled infusions of the anesthetic propofol, we used surface Laplacian referencing combined with spectral and global coherence analyses to track the spatiotemporal dynamics of the brain's anesthetic state. During unconsciousness the spectrograms in the frontal leads showed increasing α (8-12 Hz) and δ power (0-4 Hz) and in the occipital leads δ power greater than α power. The global coherence detected strong coordinated α activity in the occipital leads in the awake state that shifted to the frontal leads during unconsciousness. It revealed a lack of coordinated δ activity during both the awake and unconscious states. Although strong frontal power during general anesthesia-induced unconsciousness--termed anteriorization--is well known, its possible association with strong α range global coherence suggests highly coordinated spatial activity. Our findings suggest that combined spectral and global coherence analyses may offer a new approach to tracking brain states under general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21555565/

We also evaluated responsiveness of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based and hemodynamic parameters to surgical noxious stimulation, skin incision, and sternotomy, hypothesizing that RE would be a better responsiveness predictor.
BIS and entropy sensors were applied before anesthesia induction in 32 patients having elective cardiac surgery. Total intravenous anesthesia was standardized and guided by the BIS index with neuromuscular blockade tested with train-of-four monitoring. Parameters included SE, RE, BIS, forehead electromyography (EMG), and hemodynamic variables. Time points for analyzing BIS, entropy, and hemodynamic values were 1 min before and after: anesthesia induction, intubation, skin incision, sternotomy, cannulation of the aorta, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), cross-clamping the aorta, de-clamping the aorta, and end of CPB; also after starting the re-warming phase and at 10, 20, 30, and 40 min following.
The mean difference between BIS and SE (Bland-Altman) was 2.14 (+16/- 11; 95% CI 1.59-2.67), and between BIS and RE it was 0.02 (+14/- 14; 95% CI 0.01-0.06). BIS and SE (r(2) = 0.66; P = 0.001) and BIS and RE (r(2) = 0.7; P = 0.001) were closely correlated (Pearson's).

The effect of surgical stimulation (Cohen's d) was highest for RE after skin incision (-0.71; P = 0.0001) and sternotomy (-0.94; P = 0.0001).
Agreement was poor between the BIS index measured by BIS VISTA™ and SE values at critical anesthesia time points in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. RE was a good predictor of arousal after surgical stimulation regardless of the surgical level of muscle relaxation. Index differences most likely resulted from different algorithms for calculating consciousness level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21512777/

These two fiber types may differentially underlie different clinical pain states and distinctions in the efficacy of analgesic treatments. Methods of differentially testing C and Aδ thermal pain are widely used in animal experimentation, but these methods are not optimal for human volunteer and patient use. Thus, this project aimed to provide psychophysical and electrophysiological evidence that whether different protocols of infrared diode laser stimulation, which allows for direct activation of nociceptive terminals deep in the skin, could differentially activate Aδ or C fiber thermonociceptors in volunteers.
Short (60 ms), high intensity laser pulses (SP) evoked monomodal ""pricking"" pain which was not enhanced by topical capsaicin, whereas longer, lower power pulses (LP) evoked monomodal ""burning"" pain which was enhanced by topical capsaicin. SP also produced cortical evoked EEG potentials consistent with Aδ mediation, the amplitude of which was directly correlated with pain intensity but was not affected by topical capsaicin. LP also produced a distinct evoked potential pattern the amplitude of which was also correlated with pain intensity, which was enhanced by topical capsaicin, and the latency of which could be used to estimate the conduction velocity of the mediating nociceptive fibers.
Psychophysical and electrophysiological data were consistent with the ability of short high intensity infrared laser pulses to selectively produce Aδ mediated pain and of longer pulses to selectively produce C fiber mediated thermal pain. Thus, the use of these or similar protocols may be useful in developing and testing novel therapeutics based on the differential molecular mechanisms underlying activation of the two fiber types (e.g., TRPV1, TRPV2, etc). In addition, these protocol may be useful in determining the fiber mediation of different clinical pain types which may, in turn be useful in treatment choice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21426575/

This study compares the sedative efficacy and EEG effects of dexmedetomidine and midazolam.
EEG recordings of 60 pediatric subjects with a history of simple febrile convulsions were performed during physiologic sleep. All of these patients required sedation to obtain follow-up (control) EEGs. Subjects in Group D received 0.5 μg·kg(-1) of dexmedetomidine, and those in Group M received 0.1 mg·kg(-1) of midazolam. For rescue sedation, the same doses were repeated to maintain a Ramsey sedation score level of between 4 and 6.
The mean doses that were required for sedation were 0.76 μg·kg(-1) of dexmedetomidine and 0.38 mg·kg(-1) of midazolam. Diastolic blood pressure and HR were lower in Group D than in Group M (P < 0.05). Hypoxia was observed in 11 (36.7%) subjects in Group M and none in Group D; this was statistically significant (P < 0.001).

Initially, propofol induced increases in EEG power from 12-25 Hz. Loss of consciousness (LOC) was accompanied by the appearance of EEG slow waves that resembled the slow waves of NREM sleep. We compared slow waves in propofol to slow waves recorded during natural sleep and found that both populations of waves share similar cortical origins and preferentially propagate along the mesial components of the default network. However, propofol slow waves were spatially blurred compared to sleep slow waves and failed to effectively entrain spindle activity. Propofol also caused an increase in gamma (25-40 Hz) power that persisted throughout LOC. Source modeling analysis showed that this increase in gamma power originated from the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. During LOC, we found increased gamma functional connectivity between these regions compared to the wakefulness.
Propofol anesthesia is a sleep-like state and slow waves are associated with diminished consciousness even in the presence of high gamma activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21358845/

Since its definition, functional connectivity analysis has been used to describe temporal correlations across multiple spatial scales in PET imaging, single-unit and local field potential recordings, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), optical imaging, and fMRI. These findings have been used to identify coactivating brain regions as functional networks. In some instances, as in the case of the default mode network (DMN), functional connectivity has been used to describe ""modes"" of brain function. The opportunity to probe the anesthetized state using functional connectivity analysis has given rise to a diverse literature over the past two decades. The examination of functional connectivity in the anesthetized state is of relevance to both anesthesiologists and neuroscientists, as it has the potential to elucidate still unclear mechanisms of anesthesia while offering insight into intrinsic functional activity in the brain. Complications have arisen, however, in the form of a lack of standardization of anesthetics, dosages, depths of anesthesia, and methods of functional connectivity analysis across studies. The present work attempts to examine, elucidate, and integrate the insight that functional connectivity analysis of the anesthetized state has generated thus far.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21343409/
21285993,Awareness under general anesthesia.,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,2011,"Bischoff P, Rundshagen I","Awareness while under general anesthesia, and the later recall of what happened during surgery, can be experienced by patients as horrific events that leave lasting mental trauma behind. Patients may have both auditory and tactile perception, potentially accompanied by feelings of helplessness, inability to move, pain, and panic ranging to an acute fear of death. For some patients, the experience of awareness under anesthesia has no sequelae; for others, however, it can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, consisting of complex psychopathological phenomena such as anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, irritability, and depression possibly leading to suicidality.
The literature on the subject was selectively reviewed.
In the absence of risk factors awareness phenomena occur in one to two per 1000 operations under general anesthesia (0.1% to 0.2%) and are thus classed as an occasionally occurring critical event. In children, the risk of such phenomena occurring is 8 to 10 times higher. These phenomena are due to an inadequate depth of anesthesia with incomplete unconsciousness. They can be promoted by a number of risk factors that are either patient-related (ASA class III or above, medication abuse), surgery-related (Caesarean section, emergency procedures, surgery at night), or anesthesia-related (anesthesia without benzodiazepines, use of muscle relaxants).
Strategies for avoiding awareness phenomena under anesthesia include the training of staff to know about the problem and, specifically, the use of benzodiazepines, the avoidance of muscle relaxants if possible, and shielding the patient from excessive noise. EEG monitoring is effective but provides no guarantee against awareness. If awareness under anesthesia occurs despite these measures, the patient must be given expert, interdisciplinary treatment as soon after the event as possible in order to minimize its potential sequelae.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21285993/

Entropy, an EEG-based anesthesia depth monitor, has been used in children; however, only one other study has evaluated the effectiveness of entropy monitoring in decreasing awakening time and for titrating anesthetic agents in children undergoing short procedures under anesthesia.
In a randomized prospective single-blind parallel group trial, 50 ASA grade I-II children, aged 2-12 years, scheduled for lower abdominal or urological surgeries were studied after ethics committee approval and parental consent. The children were randomized to the entropy or control group. Following laryngeal mask airway insertion and caudal analgesia, anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide, oxygen, isoflurane. In the control group, anesthesia was titrated according to the hemodynamic parameters and the simultaneously monitored entropy values obscured from the anesthesiologist. In the entropy group, the entropy values (between 45 and 65) were used to titrate the anesthesia.
Time to awakening from anesthesia was 7 (3-18) min in the entropy group when compared to 10 (5-21) min in the control group. (P < 0.05) The difference in the mean time to awakening was 2.72 min 95% CI (0.34, 5.1). The end tidal isoflurane concentrations were lower in the entropy group when compared to the control group 15 s following airway insertion (0.78 ± 0.14 vs 1.24 ± 0.19), 15 s post caudal and skin incision (0.68 ± 0.40 vs 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.68 ± 0.03 vs 0.77 ± 0.32, respectively) as well as 5 min after skin incision 0.67 ± 0.04 vs 0.79 ± 0.02), (P ≤ 0.05).

In addition to the hypnotic agent, such as propofol, opioids are often used due to their synergistic hypnotic and analgesic properties. However, the effects of opioids on the EEG changes and the clinical state of the patient during anesthesia are complex and hinder the interpretation of the EEG-based depth of anesthesia indexes. In this paper, a novel technology for separating the anesthetic effects of propofol and an ultrashort-acting opioid, remifentanil, using the spectral features of EEG is proposed. By applying a floating search method, a well-performing feature set is achieved to estimate the effects of propofol during induction of anesthesia and to classify whether or not remifentanil has been coadministered. It is shown that including the detection of the presence of opioids to the estimated effect of propofol significantly improves the determination of the clinical state of the patient, i.e., if the patient will respond to a painful stimulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21216702/

The feature data calculated from EEG sequences corresponding to continuously deepening anesthesia are considered to form a one-dimensional nonlinear manifold in the multidimensional feature space. Utilizing a recently proposed algorithm, Isomap, the dimensionality of the feature data is reduced to achieve a one-dimensional embedding representing this manifold and thereby the continuum of neurophysiological changes during induction of anesthesia.

In such systems, monitors used as feedback sensors should preferably be Linear and Time Invariant (LTI) in order to limit sensor-induced uncertainty which can cause degraded performance. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of the BIS A2000 (Aspect Medical Systems, MA), the M-Entropy Monitor (GE HealthCare), and the NeuroSENSE Monitor (NeuroWave Systems Inc, OH), by verifying whether their dynamic behavior conforms to the LTI hypothesis.
We subjected each monitor to two different composite EEG signals containing step-wise changes in cortical activity. The first signal was used to identify Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) models that mathematically capture the dynamic behavior of each monitor. The identification of the model parameters was carried out using standard Recursive Least Squares (RLS) estimation. The second signal was used to assess the performance of the model, by comparing the output of the monitor to the simulated output predicted by the model.
While a LTI model was successfully derived for each monitor using the first signal, only the model derived for NeuroSENSE was capable to reliably predict the monitor output for the second input signals. This indicates that some algorithmic processes within the BIS A2000 and M-Entropy are non-linear and/or time variant.
While both BIS and M-Entropy monitors have been successfully used in closed-loop systems, we were unable to obtain a unique LTI model that could capture their dynamic behavior during step-wise changes in cortical activity. The uncertainty in their output during rapid changes in cortical activity impose limitations in the ability of the controller to compensate for rapid changes in patients' cortical state, and pose additional difficulties in being able to provide mathematically proof for the stability of the overall closed-loop system. Conversely, the NeuroSENSE dynamic behavior can be fully captured by a linear and time invariant transfer function, which makes it better suited for closed-loop applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21132561/

A number of EEG signal properties capable of tracking these changes have been reported and employed in anaesthetic depth monitors. The degree of phase coupling between different spectral components is a marker of nonlinear EEG generators and is claimed to be an important aspect of BIS. While bicoherence is the most direct measure of phase coupling, according to published research it is not directly used in the calculation of BIS, and only limited studies of its association with anaesthetic depth and level of consciousness have been published. This paper investigates bicoherence parameters across equal band and unequal band bifrequency regions, during different states of anaesthetic depth relating to routine clinical anaesthesia, as determined by visual inspection of EEG.
41 subjects scheduled for day surgery under general anaesthesia were recruited into this study. EEG bicoherence was analysed using average and smoothed-peak estimates calculated over different regions on the bifrequency plane. Statistical analysis of associations between anaesthetic depth/state of consciousness and bicoherence estimates included linear regression using generalised linear mixed effects models (GLMs), ROC curves and prediction probability (Pk).
Bicoherence estimates for the δ_θ region on the bifrequency plane were more sensitive to anaesthetic depth changes compared to other bifrequency regions. Smoothed-peak bicoherence displayed stronger associations than average bicoherence. Excluding burst suppression and large transients, the δ_θ peak bicoherence was significantly associated with level of anaesthetic depth (z = 25.74, p < 0.001 and R2 = 0.191). Estimates of Pk for this parameter were 0.889(0.867-0.911) and 0.709(0.689-0.729) respectively for conscious states and anaesthetic depth levels (comparable BIS estimates were 0.928(0.905-0.950) and 0.801(0.786-0.816)). Estimates of linear regression and areas under ROC curves supported Pk findings. Bicoherence for eye movement artifacts were the most distinctive with respect to other EEG patterns (average |z| value 13.233).
This study quantified associations between deepening anaesthesia and increase in bicoherence for different frequency components and bicoherence estimates. Increase in bicoherence was also established for eye movement artifacts. While identified associations extend earlier findings of bicoherence changes with increases in anaesthetic drug concentration, results indicate that the unequal band bifrequency region, δ_θ, provides better predictive capabilities than equal band bifrequency regions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21092128/

It can cause delayed recovery from anesthesia and constitutes an important differential diagnosis for prolonged postoperative unconsciousness. This condition can be diagnosed only by electroencephalogram (EEG), and the institution of early treatment is associated with better prognosis. This case is presented to illustrate the occurrence of this rare clinical entity in a patient who had undergone extradural surgery.
An elderly female with no history of seizures or predisposing factors for convulsions underwent an uncomplicated left frontotemporal craniotomy for excision of an extradural meningioma. She was unresponsive following surgery, which could not be explained by the imaging and laboratory investigations. A subsequent EEG demonstrated periodic epileptiform discharges in lateralized left hemispheric distribution characteristic of seizures. The seizures were not effectively prevented by prophylactic fosphenytoin; however, the patient responded slowly to intravenous levetiracetam, which is known to be a more effective treatment for NCSE. The patient had no predisposing factors for the development of seizures and was undergoing an extradural surgery.

the effects of sevoflurane-induced burst suppression, monitored with electroencephalography (EEG), on cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), cerebral oxygen extraction (COE) and flow autoregulation, were studied in 16 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The experimental procedure was performed during non-pulsatile CPB with mild hypothermia (34 degreesC) in fentanyl/droperidol-anesthetized patients. Middle cerebral artery transcranial Doppler flow velocity, right jugular vein bulb oxygen saturation and jugular venous pressure were measured continuously. Autoregulation was tested during changes in the mean arterial pressure (40-90 mmHg), induced by sodium nitroprusside and norepinephrine before (control), and during additional sevoflurane administration, in a dose that resulted in an EEG burst-suppression level of 4-6/min.
sevoflurane, at an inspired concentration of 3.36 ± 0.03%, induced a 17% decrease in CBFV (P<0.05) and a 22% decrease in COE (P<0.05) compared with the control.

burst-suppression doses of sevoflurane exert an intrinsic cerebral vasodilatory effect, which impairs CBF autoregulation during mildly hypothermic CPB.

In terms of EEG data analysis, G-EEMD has dramatically improved the run-time performance by more than 140 times compared to the original serial EEMD implementation. G-EEMD also performs far better than another parallelized implementation of EEMD bases on conventional CPU-based distributed computing technology despite the latter utilizes 16 high-end computing nodes for the same computing task. Furthermore, the results obtained from a pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model analysis indicate that the EEMD method is slightly more effective than its precedent alternative method (EMD) in estimating DoA, the coefficient of determination R(2) by EEMD is significantly higher than that by EMD (p < 0.05, paired t-test) and the prediction probability P(k) by EEMD is also slighter higher than that by EMD (p < 0.2, paired t-test).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20813649/

They all suffer from error due to electrical interference, individual variation and the inevitable inaccuracy inherent in the rendering of complex waveforms into a simplified digital score. It is recognised that, in the processing of complex analogue audio waveforms (i.e. sound), the human ear consistently outperforms the computer. I hypothesise that an audio signal derived from the raw EEG waveform could form the basis of a DOA monitor, enabling humans to directly determine whether a patient is awake or anaesthetised from sound alone. I propose to call the sounds derived from amplification of the EEG trace the 'audio EEG'.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20728279/

What are the patterns commonly seen during routine clinical anesthesia?
We analyzed pre-frontal EEG data from a previously published study (116 adult patients having general anesthesia maintained with either desflurane or propofol) (Leslie et al. in Anesthesiology 111:547-555, 2009), The EEG was quantified using seven estimated parameters: slope and intercept of the underlying non-oscillatory (logarithmically transformed) power spectrum, amplitude and frequency of the episodic frontal alpha (EFA) oscillation, peak power in the delta waveband, high frequency variability index, and bispectral index (BIS). We compared a 30 s EEG segment from 2 min before, with that 2 min after the surgical incision.
The pre-incision EEGs showed a wide spread of different values for the estimated EEG parameters, but the propofol group had increased EFA amplitude. Incision was associated with decreased EFA activity (p = 0.0004), and high frequency variability (p = 0.04, repeated measures ANOVA). The effects of the incision were independent of the type of drug used for maintenance of anesthesia, and on the pre-incision BIS. The loss of EFA tended to be associated with an increase in delta power (r = -0.39, p < 0.0001).
During anesthesia maintained with desflurane or propofol, surgical incision has modest effects on the EEG patterns. It does not cause an increase in high frequency power; the most consistent changes are a loss of EFA amplitude and burst suppression patterns. This effect is not strongly modified by the depth of anesthesia--as estimated by the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20680669/

Point-of-care monitoring can potentially dictate changes to management intraoperatively. In this observational study, we examined the correlation between a series of point-of-care monitors and lactate flux during CEA.
Both neurosurgeons and vascular surgeons participated in the study. The patients underwent arterial-jugular venous blood sampling for oxygen, carbon dioxide, glucose, and lactate, n = 26; bispectral index (BIS) monitoring ipsilateral to side of surgery, n = 26; raw and processed electroencephalogram (EEG), n = 22; and bi-frontal cerebral oximetry using the Fore-Sight monitor, n = 20.
One patient experienced a new neurological deficit when assessed at 24 hr following surgery. Lactate flux into the brain was correlated with the greatest decrease in cerebral oximetry with carotid cross-clamping; lactate efflux was correlated with the least. The most noticeable changes in processed EEG (density spectral analysis) were also seen with lactate influx, but at a slower time resolution than cerebral oximetry. Loss of autoregulatory behaviour was demonstrated with lactate influx; however, no correlation was seen between lactate flux and BIS monitoring.
There was a correlation between cerebral oximetry and lactate flux during carotid cross-clamping. The Fore-Sight monitor may be of value as a point-of-care monitor during CEA under general anesthesia. A novel finding of this study is lactate flux into the brain in the presence of a large difference in cerebral oxygenation during cross-clamping of the carotid artery.

20652380,SNAP II versus BIS VISTA monitor comparison during general anesthesia.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2010,"Hrelec C, Puente E, Bergese S, Dzwonczyk R","Effectively monitoring the level of consciousness during general anesthesia is clinically beneficial to both the patient and the physician. An electroencephalogram (EEG)-based level-of-consciousness monitor can help minimize intraoperative awareness as well as the effects of over-sedation. In this study, we compared the SNAP II (Stryker Instruments, Kalamazoo, MI USA) and BIS VISTA (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA USA) monitors' primary metrics (SI and BIS, respectively) in terms of correlation, agreement and responsiveness to return to preoperative baseline in surgical cases involving general anesthesia.
With institutional approval and written informed consent, 33 patients received general anesthesia with isoflurane while undergoing abdominal surgery. We attached both the SNAP II and BIS VISTA electrodes to each patient. We collected data from each monitor simultaneously and continuously, beginning just prior to induction and ending after extubation. Each monitor's level-of-consciousness index is a unit less metric that ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating full consciousness. We performed a Bland-Altman and parameter difference analyses on the data. We calculated the time it took for each monitor to return to preoperative baseline level following cessation of anesthesia. We established an equivalence between the two indices over their entire range for our particular clinical scenario.
The indices were correlated (r = 0.736, P < 0.0001, N = 3,706 data point pairs). There was an overall difference between the two indices (median = 16.0, 25th/75th%ile = 10.0/21.1) with BIS lower than SI. A 40-60 BIS range (the typical target range during general anesthesia) was approximately equivalent to a 54-74 SI range. In all 33 subjects, SI reached baseline before BIS at the end of the case (median = 3.3 min, 25th/75th%ile = 1.6 min/8.2 min versus median = 8.9 min, 25th/75th = 3.7 min/14.5 min, P = 0.0200), even though both metrics were equal at the beginning of the case.
Although the SI and BIS both can assess a patient's level of consciousness and are correlated, they are not in agreement with each other numerically and therefore are not interchangeable. It is difficult to assess each monitor's true responsiveness to acute changes in consciousness level from our study design. The differences between the metrics we observed in this study are most likely due to differences in signal processing methodologies, EEG frequencies employed and signal filtering utilized in the monitors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20652380/

20581428,Multiscale permutation entropy analysis of EEG recordings during sevoflurane anesthesia.,Journal of neural engineering,2010,"Li D, Li X, Liang Z, Voss LJ, Sleigh JW","Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring of the effect of anesthetic drugs on the central nervous system has long been used in anesthesia research. Several methods based on nonlinear dynamics, such as permutation entropy (PE), have been proposed to analyze EEG series during anesthesia. However, these measures are still single-scale based and may not completely describe the dynamical characteristics of complex EEG series. In this paper, a novel measure combining multiscale PE information, called CMSPE (composite multi-scale permutation entropy), was proposed for quantifying the anesthetic drug effect on EEG recordings during sevoflurane anesthesia. Three sets of simulated EEG series during awake, light and deep anesthesia were used to select the parameters for the multiscale PE analysis: embedding dimension m, lag tau and scales to be integrated into the CMSPE index. Then, the CMSPE index and raw single-scale PE index were applied to EEG recordings from 18 patients who received sevoflurane anesthesia. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modeling was used to relate the measured EEG indices and the anesthetic drug concentration. Prediction probability (P(k)) statistics and correlation analysis with the response entropy (RE) index, derived from the spectral entropy (M-entropy module; GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland), were investigated to evaluate the effectiveness of the new proposed measure. It was found that raw single-scale PE was blind to subtle transitions between light and deep anesthesia, while the CMSPE index tracked these changes accurately. Around the time of loss of consciousness, CMSPE responded significantly more rapidly than the raw PE, with the absolute slopes of linearly fitted response versus time plots of 0.12 (0.09-0.15) and 0.10 (0.06-0.13), respectively. The prediction probability P(k) of 0.86 (0.85-0.88) and 0.85 (0.80-0.86) for CMSPE and raw PE indicated that the CMSPE index correlated well with the underlying anesthetic effect. The correlation coefficient for the comparison between the CMSPE index and RE index of 0.84 (0.80-0.88) was significantly higher than the raw PE index of 0.75 (0.66-0.84). The results show that the CMSPE outperforms the raw single-scale PE in reflecting the sevoflurane drug effect on the central nervous system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20581428/

This may have potential clinical implications on therapeutic success and elimination of the undesirable effects associated with this treatment modality.
: Propofol anesthesia when compared with barbiturates may induce relatively shorter duration seizures during MECT. This study was designed with the intent to test the hypothesis that the bispectral index (BIS) electroencephalogram (EEG) could predict MECT-induced seizure duration and awakening under propofol anesthesia.
: Twenty-five patients, between 16 and 60 years of age (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II), underwent a total of 100 MECT sessions (4 sessions each) under propofol anesthesia (1.0 mg/kg) in a prospective, observational study. The BIS was monitored continuously, and average BIS values of each of the 4 sessions of MECT that each patient received were analyzed. Bispectral index values were recorded at T0 (baseline), T1 (before induction), T2 (after propofol), T3 (preictal), T4 (postictal), T5 (awakening), and T6 (1 minute after awakening). Motor seizure duration was measured by isolated forearm technique and electrical seizure duration by BIS EEG.
: The mean preictal BIS was 50 (SD, 14), which was found to have a significant positive correlation (P < 0.01) with motor (r = 0.707) as well as electrical seizure duration (r = 0.736). A significant negative correlation was also found between the preictal BIS value and the time to eye opening (3.53 [SD, 1.8] minutes) (r = -0.397; P < 0.05). Awakening occurred at mean BIS value of 52 (SD, 17) (range, 20-97) during this procedure.
: The mean pre-ECT BIS values correlate significantly with the durations of both the motor and electrical seizure activity and awakening time under propofol anesthesia. Before extrapolation to daily clinical practice, further large controlled clinical trials need to be done to establish the role of BIS monitoring in predicting seizure duration and awakening time during MECT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20562643/

More recently, identification of resting state networks (RSN) paved the way to investigate spontaneous task-unrelated brain activity. The cardinal features characterising RSN are low-frequency fluctuations of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals synchronised between spatially distinct, but functionally connected brain areas. Simultaneous EEG/fMRI has been previously deployed to study the neurophysiological signature of RSN by comparing EEG power with BOLD amplitudes. We hypothesised that band-limited EEG power may be directly related to network-specific functional connectivity (FC) of BOLD signal time courses. Hence, we studied the association between individual EEG signature and FC in a core RSN, the so-called default mode network (DMN). Combined EEG/fMRI data of 20 healthy volunteers collected during a 15-minute rest period were analysed. Using an inter-subject analysis design, we demonstrated a network and frequency specific relation between RSN FC and EEG. In a multiple regression model, EEG band-powers explained 70% of DMN FC variance, with significant partial correlations of DMN FC to delta (r=-0.73) and beta (r=0.53) power. The identified EEG pattern has been previously associated with increased alertness. Conversely, an established EEG-derived sedation index (spectral edge frequency SEF95) closely correlated with DMN FC. The study presents an approach that opens a new perspective to EEG/fMRI correlation. Direct evidence was provided for a distinct neurophysiological correlate of DMN FC. This finding further validates the biological relevance of network-specific intrinsic FC and provides an initial neurophysiological basis for interpreting studies of DMN FC alterations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20538065/

Outcome was assessed at 1 year of age. All 26 patients showed a normal preoperative continuous cerebral activity with sleep-wake cycles (SWC). The postoperative duration to return to normal background activity with SWC was similar for both groups. Independent of group assignment, patients requiring midazolam had a significantly later onset of a normal SWC than those without midazolam (p=0.03). Three patients in the CPB group and two in the non-CPB group showed continuous low voltage or flat trace after administration of fentanyl. These changes did not correlate with neurodevelopmental outcome. Sedation with midazolam has a transient effect on the background activity, whereas fentanyl can induce a severe pathologic background pattern. The significance of these changes on outcome is not yet clear.

EEG seizures are associated with prolonged deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and with adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. We performed video/EEG monitoring before and for 72 hours after neonatal cardiac surgery, using a high-flow CPB protocol and cerebral oxygenation monitoring, to ascertain incidence, severity, and factors associated with EEG seizures.
The CPB protocol included 150 mL/kg/min flows, pH stat management, hematocrit >30%, and high-flow antegrade cerebral perfusion. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSo(2)) was monitored, with a treatment protocol for rSo(2) <50%. EEG was assessed for seizures.
Sixty-eight patients (36 single ventricle [SV] and 32 2-ventricle [2V]) were monitored for a total of 4824 hours. The total midazolam dose was 2.4 mg/kg (1.5-7.3 mg/kg) (median, 25th-75th percentile) for the SV group and 1.3 mg/kg (1.0-2.7 mg/kg) for the 2V group (P = 0.009). One SV patient experienced 2 brief EEG seizures postoperatively (1.5% incidence; 95% confidence interval: 0.3%-7.9%). The SV patients experienced a significant incidence of cerebral desaturation (rSo(2) <45% for >240 minutes total) perioperatively (18 of 36 SV vs 0 of 32 2V patients, P < 0.001). This difference did not affect electrographic seizure occurrence or other EEG characteristics.
EEG seizures are infrequent in neonates undergoing surgery with high-flow CPB. Cerebral desaturation did not affect EEG seizure occurrence; however, benzodiazepines may play a role in suppressing postoperative seizures caused by cerebral hypoxemia in this patient population.

Widespread use remains limited and this review examines reasons why children do not yet enjoy such benefits.
There is no integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis that can supply parameter estimates to be programmed into pumps for either plasma or effect-site concentration determination over the broad paediatric age range. The six pharmacokinetic parameter sets available for children out of infancy all differ. Validation studies are few. Estimates in neonates and infants are dependent on maturation and size considerations that have not yet been elucidated. There remains a need for specific neonate-derived algorithms if electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived anaesthesia depth monitors are to be used for neonates or infants. End-tidal breath analysis of propofol offers a useful tool for central compartment monitoring.
Hardware limitations, a lack of integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies and target monitoring issues restrict use.

The objective of this study was to analyse the pharmacodynamic interaction of propofol and sevoflurane on BIS using a surface response model in patients undergoing general anaesthesia with i.v. induction and inhalation maintenance.
We performed a prospective study in 24 patients undergoing general anaesthesia with propofol induction and sevoflurane maintenance. Anaesthetic depth was measured with a BIS VISTA Bilateral monitor. Propofol biophase concentration was determined using a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model, and sevoflurane end-tidal concentration was measured continuously. The response surface model described by Minto and colleagues was used to analyse the interaction. Statistical analysis was performed with Excel 2002 and SPSS v11.0.
The mean value of U(50)(theta) was 0.956 (sd 0.029) in the overall estimated data, and remained within the predefined range for all ratios of the drugs, fulfilling the criterion of additivity. The median of the weighted residuals between the actual BIS value and the BIS value predicted by the model was -5.926%.

Subjects comprised 11 patients scheduled to undergo heart surgery under extracorporeal circulation. Anesthesia was maintained by intravenous administration of propofol combined with remifentanil, using a bispectral index (BIS) monitor to keep an identical BIS value (target BIS value, 40-45). Raw EEG signals were collected through the BIS monitor. Approximate entropy, bicoherence and power spectrum were analyzed before and after CPB, in addition to other EEG parameters.
In the late hypothermic CPB period, both 95% spectral edge frequency and approximate entropy decreased, notwithstanding a lack of significant difference in BIS index. Bicoherence growths in delta-theta and alpha areas decreased simultaneously.
In the late CPB period, although BIS value is unchanged, EEG often expresses a slow EEG rhythm accompanied by disproportional de-synchronous characteristics.
CPB caused the EEG de-synchronous features, which are not quantified by the BIS algorithm. It has the possibility to increase the vulnerability of nociceptive perception.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20382560/

We undertook this study to verify the prognostic value of clinical and electrophysiological variables in the TH setting.
A total of 111 consecutive comatose survivors of CA treated with TH were prospectively studied over a 3-year period. Neurological examination, electroencephalography (EEG), and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were performed immediately after TH, at normothermia and off sedation. Neurological recovery was assessed at 3 to 6 months, using Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC).
Three clinical variables, assessed within 72 hours after CA, showed higher false-positive mortality predictions as compared with the AAN guidelines: incomplete brainstem reflexes recovery (4% vs 0%), myoclonus (7% vs 0%), and absent motor response to pain (24% vs 0%). Furthermore, unreactive EEG background was incompatible with good long-term neurological recovery (CPC 1-2) and strongly associated with in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio for death, 15.4; 95% confidence interval, 3.3-71.9). The presence of at least 2 independent predictors out of 4 (incomplete brainstem reflexes, myoclonus, unreactive EEG, and absent cortical SSEP) accurately predicted poor long-term neurological recovery (positive predictive value = 1.00); EEG reactivity significantly improved the prognostication.
Our data show that TH may modify outcome prediction after CA, implying that some clinical features should be interpreted with more caution in this setting as compared with the AAN guidelines. EEG background reactivity is useful in determining the prognosis after CA treated with TH.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20373341/

In this proof-of-concept study, general anesthesia with etomidate was used to improve effectiveness of MEG-recordings.
MEG-recordings of six patients with focal epilepsy were performed before and after application of etomidate. Spike frequency and localization accuracy of MEG with general anesthesia were compared with spontaneous MEG.
After application of etomidate, an increase in spike frequency occurred in all patients, and movement artifacts were prevented. In one patient, spikes could only be detected by invasive EEG but not by MEG. The results were in accordance with spontaneous MEG or presurgical hypotheses about localizations of neocortical foci in three patients. Dipole localizations were distributed over fronto-temporal areas in three patients with ipsilateral temporo-mesial focus hypotheses.
Etomidate ameliorated spike yield and stopped movement artifacts during MEG recordings in patients with focal epilepsy. Localization results were especially accurate in patients with neocortical epilepsy.
These results could facilitate larger studies on the usefulness and safety of general anesthesia with etomidate that record and localize epileptic activity in patients with focal epilepsy by MEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20363182/

Subsequently, to validate the findings of this case, processed EEG was recorded during 2 other cases in which care was withdrawn without the use of hypnotic or anesthetic drugs. We found that changes in processed EEG immediately after withdrawal of care were not only reproducible, but can happen in the absence of changes in major electromyographic or electrocardiographic artifact. It is well documented that processed EEG is prone to artifacts. However, in the setting of DCD, these changes in processed EEG deserve some consideration. If these changes are not due to artifact, dosing of hypnotic or anesthetic drugs might be warranted.

The indications for cEEG, as well as when and how to treat NCS, remain unclear. We aimed to describe the current practice of cEEG in critically ill patients to define areas of uncertainty that could aid in designing future research.
We conducted an international survey of neurologists focused on cEEG utilization and NCS management.
Three-hundred and thirty physicians completed the survey. 83% use cEEG at least once per month and 86% manage NCS at least five times per year. The use of cEEG in patients with altered mental status was common (69%), with higher use if the patient had a prior convulsion (89%) or abnormal eye movements (85%). Most respondents would continue cEEG for 24 h. If NCS or NCSE is identified, the most common anticonvulsants administered were phenytoin/fosphenytoin, lorazepam, or levetiracetam, with slightly more use of levetiracetam for NCS than NCSE.
Continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG) is commonly employed in critically ill patients to detect NCS and NCSE. However, there is substantial variability in current practice related to cEEG indications and duration and to management of NCS and NCSE. The fact that such variability exists in the management of this common clinical problem suggests that further prospective study is needed.

We developed methods of EEG analysis to quantify episodic EEG patterns--namely sleep spindle-like ('10 Hz-score') and burst-suppression-like fluctuations in high frequencies ('high frequency variation index')--and used traditional power spectral quantification of non-episodic delta waves. We studied 30 healthy adult patients undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia with propofol, fentanyl (1.0, 2.5 or 4.0 microg/kg, n=10 for each group), muscle relaxant and sevoflurane. Prefrontal EEG data were recorded during the operation and analysed for changes in episodic patterns before and after noxious stimuli (intubation and incision). Before noxious stimuli, the EEG patterns varied markedly between patients and were not strongly correlated to calculated effect-site concentrations of fentanyl, propofol or sevoflurane. Noxious stimuli reduced the 10 Hz-score from 0.25 to 0.20 (P = 0.01) after intubation and from 0.33 to 0.27 (P = 0.01) after incision; and high frequency variation index from 2.8 to 2.0 (P=0.02) after incision--the classical arousal pattern. The nociception-induced reduction in spindles was greater in the low-dose fentanyl group (P = 0.01). There was less tachycardia in the high-dose fentanyl group (P = 0.002). It is possible to quantify such episodic EEG patterns during general anaesthesia and in this study noxious stimulation tended to reduce the prevalence of these patterns.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20191785/

This is a time when subjects, if awakened, may report little or no conscious content. We hypothesized that a similar breakdown of cortical effective connectivity may underlie loss of consciousness (LOC) induced by pharmacologic agents. Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing EEG responses to TMS during wakefulness and LOC induced by the benzodiazepine midazolam. Unlike spontaneous sleep states, a subject's level of vigilance can be monitored repeatedly during pharmacological LOC. We found that, unlike during wakefulness, wherein TMS triggered responses in multiple cortical areas lasting for >300 ms, during midazolam-induced LOC, TMS-evoked activity was local and of shorter duration. Furthermore, a measure of the propagation of evoked cortical currents (significant current scattering, SCS) could reliably discriminate between consciousness and LOC. These results resemble those observed in early NREM sleep and suggest that a breakdown of cortical effective connectivity may be a common feature of conditions characterized by LOC. Moreover, these results suggest that it might be possible to use TMS-EEG to assess consciousness during anesthesia and in pathological conditions, such as coma, vegetative state, and minimally conscious state.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20133802/

During out of office hours and weekends, cEEG monitoring is not always available. The Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor can be used to assess the hypnotic component of general anesthesia. We conducted a study to evaluate the feasibility of using the BIS monitoring to assess the burst suppression (BS) pattern during propofol anesthesia in RSE.
Ten adult patients with RSE admitted to the ICU were monitored simultaneously with cEEG and BIS monitoring. We compared the BIS and suppression ratio (SR) values with the EEG burst suppression pattern when the depth of anesthesia was titrated to the BS level monitoring by cEEG.
We found an excellent correlation between the cEEG burst rate per minute and the BIS (r² =-0.9; p< 0.001) and SR (r² = -0.88; p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of BIS score of 30 to detect BS in electroencephalography were 99% and 98%, respectively. The BIS monitor was not able to recognize regional epileptic activity and epileptic bursts during the BS pattern.
The cEEG can be considered as the primary monitoring technique in the assessment of the depth of anesthesia in the treatment of RSE. If cEEG is not available, the BIS monitor can be used to guide the level of anesthesia, targeting BS in patients with RSE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20132290/

Seventy consecutive carotid endarterectomies under regional anaesthesia were divided into two surgical groups: patients with and patients without neurological deficits. Patients' neurological status was evaluated and neurological deficits were compared with BIS values. Measurements were made at different surgical stages: baseline, after sedation, at the beginning of surgery, at preclamping, at the 3 min clamping test, during shunt insertion, at declamping, 15 min after declamping and at the end of surgery. We performed intergroup and intragroup comparisons of BIS values. A decrease in BIS of at least 10 associated with neurological deficits was taken as the cut-off point for the classification of patients with logistic regression models (crude and adjusted for potential confounders).

The results were compared to an equivalent number of consecutive EEGs performed without CH over the same time period (non-CH-EEGs). The clinical impact of the CH-EEG findings was evaluated by evaluating resulting clinical decisions made in the medical record. Chi-squared analysis was performed for discontinuous data, Student's t-test for continuous data.

To provide quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the effect of dexmedetomidine sedation on the EEG of children.
Children with intractable epilepsy admitted for surgery undergo 5 days of continuous EEG monitoring as well as nuclear medicine imaging studies with dexmedetomidine for sedation. Continuous EEG monitoring of each child during both natural sleep and dexmedetomidine-induced sedation provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine on the EEG of children.
Sixteen children undergoing dexmedetomidine sedation for nuclear medicine studies and simultaneous continuous EEG monitoring were studied. EEG segments during sedation were compared to samples of naturally occurring stage II sleep from the same child. Standard visual EEG analysis, quantification of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and total RMS power, number and location of spike foci, and frequency of spike activity were compared.
The EEG during dexmedetomidine sedation resembled stage II sleep. During sedation, statistically significant increases in power of 16% for theta (P = 0.01), 21% for alpha (P = 0.03), and 40% for beta (P < 0.01) were observed, but not for delta (P = 0.63) or total EEG power (P = 0.61). Spike frequency increased by 47% during sedation but no new spike foci or seizures were observed.

However, the response is small and must be extracted from high levels of background noise. A key consideration in using the MLR for clinical monitoring is whether data quality is sufficient to detect small changes. The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of the MLR recorded during anaesthesia, as a rigorous analysis of data quality is lacking in many studies. MLR recordings from patients sedated in intensive care after cardiac surgery were compared to recordings from a reference group of young volunteers with normal hearing. Data quality was measured with the F(sp) parameter. A bootstrap analysis was used to measure statistical response presence and to detect within-subject changes during clinical anaesthesia. Noise levels were high in the normative group probably due to myogenic and EEG activity. With 5 Hz click stimulation, MLR presence in the normative group was below 30%. Response presence improved using stimulation paradigms with chirps or maximum length sequences and reached 100% with a combination of maximum length sequences and chirps. F(sp) values generally improved during anaesthesia as noise levels reduced and MLR presence was 100% for MLS click stimulation. Changes in the MLR amplitude with propofol infusion rate were small. Some within-subject changes in MLR amplitude were detected using the bootstrap analysis, but 100% detection was not possible.

19949325,Awareness in cardiac anesthesia.,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2010,Serfontein L,"Cardiac surgery represents a sub-group of patients at significantly increased risk of intraoperative awareness. Relatively few recent publications have targeted the topic of awareness in this group. The aim of this review is to identify areas of awareness research that may equally be extrapolated to cardiac anesthesia in the attempt to increase understanding of the nature and significance of this scenario and how to reduce it.
The formation of both implicit and explicit memory during anesthesia may be the result of fluctuations in hypnotic state. Owing to the low incidence of awareness, prospective studies produce inadequate patient numbers to clearly identify risks, causes and sequelae of intraoperative awareness. A recent analysis of case reports has identified two main risk factors for intraoperative awareness. Awareness research increasingly focuses on refining processed electroencephalography (EEG) monitors and establishing their effectiveness in reducing awareness, but with conflicting results.
Identification of high-risk patients, the use of balanced anesthesia techniques and increased vigilance on the part of the anesthetist will go a long way in preventing intraoperative awareness. There is evidence that using processed EEG monitors reduces the incidence of awareness. However, understanding their limitations and interpatient variability in dose-response curves, and interpreting the data in relation to the specific drugs and techniques used is paramount.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19949325/

RE and SE compared favorably with BIS and their correlations were strong (r(2) = 0.6, r(2) = 0.55, respectively). The mean bias of RE and BIS was -1.8, but limits of agreement were high (+20.5/-24.1). RE and SE tended to be lower than the BIS values in the CPB subgroups. The detection of BSR was similar with RE and SE and the BIS. A strong correlation existed between BIS and f-EMG (r(2) = 0.62) in contrast to RE (r(2) = 0.45) and SE (r(2) =0.39).

Clinical events related to respiratory depression were noted during the procedure, including the addition of or increase in the flow rate of supplemental oxygen, the use of a bag-valve mask apparatus, airway repositioning, or stimulation to induce breathing. After the procedure, patients were asked if they experienced pain during the procedure or had recall of the procedure.
A total of 150 patients were enrolled; 146 underwent sedation and were included in the analysis. Seventy-four patients received propofol, and 71 received propofol with alfentanil. No clinically significant complications were noted. Subclinical respiratory depression was seen in 24/74 patients in the propofol group and 30/71 patients in the propofol/alfentanil group (effect size = 9.8%, 95% CI = -5.8% to 25.5%). Clinical signs of respiratory depression included an increase in supplemental oxygen use in 25 of the 74 propofol patients and 31 of the 71 propofol/alfentanil patients (effect size 9.9%, 95% CI = -5.9% to 25.7%), the use of bag-valve mask apparatus in seven patients in the propofol group and 12 in the propofol/alfentanil group (effect size = 5.6%, 95% CI = -3.5% to 18.4%), airway repositioning in 13 propofol patients and 20 propofol/alfentanil patients (effect size = 10.6%, 95% CI = -3.0% to 24.2%), and stimulation to induce breathing in 11 propofol patients and 20 propofol/alfentanil patients (effect size = 13.3%, 95% CI = 0.1% to 26.5%). The total time of the procedure was longer for the alfentanil/propofol group (median = 11 minutes, range = 5-22 minutes) than for the propofol group (median = 9 minutes, range = 1 to 43 minutes; effect size = 1.93 minutes, 95% CI = 0.73 to 2.58, p = 0.02). Pain during the procedure was reported by 10 of the 74 patients in the propofol group and 7 of the 71 patients in the propofol/alfentanil group (effect size = 4.5%, 95% CI = -6.8% to 14.1%). Recall of some part of the procedure was reported by 12 patients in the propofol group and 9 in the propofol/alfentanil group (effect size = 3.5%, 95% CI = -7.9% to 15.0%). All procedures were successfully completed.
The use of supplemental alfentanil with propofol for procedural sedation did not result in a difference in reported pain or recall immediately after the procedure. There was an increase in the proportion of patients who required stimulation to induce respiration during the procedure in patients who received propofol with supplemental alfentanil. The addition of supplemental opioid to procedural sedation with propofol does not appear beneficial.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19845550/

To date, the technique most commonly used for insular stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is the orthogonal-transopercular electrode approach with the Talairach methodology. We propose another technique utilizing MRI with transinsular parasagittal electrodes and a posterior entry point. This avoids passing through the opercula and sylvian vessels running over the insular surface.
Nine patients, whose seizures implicated the insula, underwent brain surgery. Under general anesthesia with a Leksell frame, 3D-T(1) SPGR MRI with gadolinium enhancement was achieved. Surgical planning was performed using the StealthStation with an entry point in the parieto-occipital junction setting the target for the first contact of the lead at the most anterior part of the insula. The trajectory was manipulated in order to have at least 4 contacts per electrode track within the insular cortex. All patients had a postoperative MRI to verify the exact position of each contact.
Insular seizures were recorded in all patients. There was neither intracranial bleeding nor infection. In all of the cases, except 1, the seizures recorded were found to be propagations of the primary epileptic zone located in the temporal lobe, either in the mesial structures or the superior temporal gyrus. Eight patients were operated, 7 with an antero-mesial temporal lobectomy and 1 with dysplasia of the superior temporal gyrus. No insular resections were performed.
We report a novel technique for insular SEEG with parasagittal electrodes, parallel to the insular cortex, with an entry point at the parieto-occipital junction. This technique is based entirely on use of MRI, and avoids passing through the opercula and sylvian vessels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19844136/

We report a case series of seven patients who were neurologically intact before the decision to withdraw care due to extensive systemic critical illness. As part of our end-of-life care protocol, bispectral index (BIS) monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) or SEDline (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) monitoring devices are placed on each patient to ensure adequate comfort. Both monitoring systems use an integer-based system (BIS or PSI, respectively) to reflect the level of consciousness/effect of anesthesia. In each case, loss of blood pressure, as monitored by indwelling arterial line, was followed by a decline is BIS/PSI activity followed by a transient spike in BIS/PSI activity that approached levels normally associated with consciousness. This spike in electroencephalogram (EEG) activity had short duration and the activity then declined to a level of activity associated with burst suppression. In one case of a patient who had a SEDLine device, we were able to capture and analyze the raw EEG signal, and confirm that the EEG waveform was not artifact, and in fact a high frequency waveform was present during the spike activity. We speculate that this level of BIS/SEDline activity is related to the cellular loss of membrane polarization due to hypoxemia. We further speculate that since this increase in electrical activity occurred when there was no discernable blood pressure, patients who suffer ""near death"" experiences may be recalling the aggregate memory of the synaptic activity associated with this terminal but potentially reversible hypoxemia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19803731/
19773649,Depth of anesthesia.,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2009,"Kent CD, Domino KB","The present review article provides a summary of the recent literature evaluating the technology for monitoring depth of anesthesia and patient outcomes associated with its use.
The tentative and controversial findings of a 2006 study suggesting a correlation of mortality with lower intraoperative bispectral index scores were reproduced in a more recent study, but the correlation could be accounted for by controlling for patient comorbidities, particularly malignancy. In a large trial involving patients at high risk for awareness, general anesthesia with volatile agents guided by bispectral index monitoring was associated with a low incidence of awareness, but no more so than the use of alarms for limits on volatile agent concentration. Studies comparing both emerging and more established brain function monitors suggest that, in spite of their different algorithms for processing and filtering electromyographic signal, many monitors are affected by the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Recent evidence is consistent with previous studies that describe a nonlinear model for the dose-response of EEG parameters to increasing concentration of anesthetic agents with a dosing plateau response over a clinically relevant dose range.
The goal of precisely dosed general anesthesia guided by brain monitoring remains elusive.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19773649/

Le journal canadien des sciences neurologiques,2009,Young GB,"Continuous EEG monitoring (CEEG) in the ICU is increasingly recognized as valuable means of monitoring cerebral function, otherwise inaccessible in the comatose patient. The principal applications are: monitoring for seizures and ischemia, guiding therapy for seizures and ischemia (especially vasospasm), adjusting levels of sedation for paralyzed or delirious patients, charting trends in brain function and prognosis. Continuous EEG monitoring is faced with numerous challenges: electrode failures (better electrodes are needed to replace standard EEG electrodes), documentation in the absence of a technologist, artifacts peculiar to ICU, prompt interpretation and review of large amounts of data, resource allocation and establishing the technology as being useful in improving outcomes and shortening ICU and hospital length of stay.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19760913/
19757102,Guidelines for intraoperative neuromonitoring using raw (analog or digital waveforms) and quantitative electroencephalography: a position statement by the American Society of Neurophysiological Monitoring.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2009,"Isley MR, Edmonds HL, Stecker M, ","Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the oldest and most commonly utilized modalities for intraoperative neuromonitoring. Historically, interest in the EEG patterns associated with anesthesia is as old as the discovery of the EEG itself. The evolution of its intraoperative use was also expanded to include monitoring for assessing cortical perfusion and oxygenation during a variety of vascular, cardiac, and neurosurgical procedures. Furthermore, a number of quantitative or computer-processed algorithms have also been developed to aid in its visual representation and interpretation. The primary clinical outcomes for which modern EEG technology has made significant intraoperative contributions include: (1) recognizing and/or preventing perioperative ischemic insults, and (2) monitoring of brain function for anesthetic drug administration in order to determine depth of anesthesia (and level of consciousness), including the tailoring of drug levels to achieve a predefined neural effect (e.g., burst suppression). While the accelerated development of microprocessor technologies has fostered an extraordinarily rapid growth in the use of intraoperative EEG, there is still no universal adoption of a monitoring technique(s) or of criteria for its neural end-point(s) by anesthesiologists, surgeons, neurologists, and neurophysiologists. One of the most important limitations to routine intraoperative use of EEG may be the lack of standardization of methods, alarm criteria, and recommendations related to its application. Lastly, refinements in technology and signal processing can be expected to advance the usefulness of the intraoperative EEG for both anesthetic and surgical management of patients.
This paper is the position statement of the American Society of Neurophysiological Monitoring. It is the practice guidelines for the intraoperative use of raw (analog and digital) and quantitative EEG.
The following recommendations are based on trends in the current scientific and clinical literature and meetings, guidelines published by other organizations, expert opinion, and public review by the members of the American Society of Neurophysiological Monitoring. This document may not include all possible methodologies and interpretative criteria, nor do the authors and their sponsor intentionally exclude any new alternatives.
The use of the techniques reviewed in these guidelines may reduce perioperative neurological morbidity and mortality.

We assessed the frequency, interindividual variability and clinical impact of high BIS values during clinically deep sedation.
Prospective observational study in two university-affiliated intensive care units.
Sixty-two mechanically ventilated patients requiring intravenous sedation and analgesia for >or=24 h.
Paired measurements of BIS and sedation measured on the adaptation to intensive care environment (ATICE) score were obtained every 3 h until awakening. A paired measurement with BIS >60 at deep sedation (ATICE Awakeness <or=2) was defined as discordant. Patients were considered discordant if their individual ratio of number of discordant measurements to number of total measurements during deep sedation was above the median discordance ratio of the overall cohort. At least one discordant assessment was observed in 52 patients (83.9%). Median individual discordance ratio was 32% (14.3-50.0%). Time from awakening to first T-piece trial [16 h (4-34) vs. 46 h (9-109), p = 0.01] and to extubation [35 h (23-89) vs. 88 h (46-152 h), p = 0.05] were significantly shorter in discordant compared to concordant patients. BIS-ATICE discordance was independently associated with successful extubation within 48 h after awakening (OR 6.7, CI 95% 1.8-25.0, p = 0.005). The rate of ICU recall was not different in BIS-ATICE discordant and concordant patients.

Still unanswered questions include whether midazolam-induced sigma-augmentation also involves the medial temporal region, which plays a role in memory encoding. Taking advantage of rare and unique opportunities to monitor neuronal activities using intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) recording, we determined how intravenous administration of midazolam elicited spectral frequency changes in the human cerebral cortex, including the medial temporal region. We studied three children with focal epilepsy who underwent subdural electrode placement and extraoperative ECoG recording for subsequent resection of the seizure focus; an intravenous bolus of midazolam was given to abort an ongoing simple partial seizure or to provide sedation prior to induction of general anesthesia. 'Midazolam-induced ECoG frequency alteration' in sites distant from the seizure focus was sequentially animated on their individual three-dimensional MR images. The common ECoG changes induced by midazolam included gradual augmentation of sigma-oscillations (12-16 Hz) in the widespread non-epileptic regions, including the medial temporal region. The spatial and temporal alteration of ECoG spectral frequency pattern can be appreciated via animation movies. Midazolam-induced sigma-augmentation was observed in the medial temporal region in our relatively small cohort of human subjects. In-vivo animation of ECoG spectral measures provided a unique situation to study the effect of midazolam on neuronal processing in the deep brain regions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19733366/
19729288,Adapted variable precision rough set approach for EEG analysis.,Artificial intelligence in medicine,2009,"Ningler M, Stockmanns G, Schneider G, Kochs HD, Kochs E","Rough set theory (RST) provides powerful methods for reduction of attributes and creation of decision rules, which have successfully been applied in numerous medical applications. The variable precision rough set model (VPRS model), an extension of the original rough set approach, tolerates some degree of misclassification of the training data. The basic idea of the VPRS model is to change the class information of those objects whose class information cannot be induced without contradiction from the available attributes. Thereafter, original methods of RST are applied. An approach of this model is presented that allows uncertain objects to change class information during the process of attribute reduction and rule generation. This method is referred to as variable precision rough set approach with flexible classification of uncertain objects (VPRS(FC) approach) and needs only slight modifications of the original VPRS model.
To compare the VPRS model and VPRS(FC) approach both methods are applied to a clinical data set based on electroencephalogram of awake and anesthetized patients. For comparison, a second data set obtained from the UCI machine learning repository is used. It describes the shape of different vehicle types. Further well known feature selection methods were applied to both data sets to compare their results with the results provided by rough set based approaches.
The VPRS(FC) approach requires higher computational effort, but is able to achieve better reduction of attributes for noisy or inconsistent data and provides smaller rule sets.
The presented approach is a useful method for substantial attribute reduction in noisy and inconsistent data sets.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19729288/

In our pilot study, we evaluated EEG spectral power during spontaneous drops in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in deeply sedated and mechanically ventilated patients with severe stroke. We aimed to identify parameters that may be used for continuous monitoring even in patients with a burst-suppression baseline EEG pattern.
Twenty ventilated and sedated patients with severe hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke underwent continuous EEG monitoring with synchronous CPP recording.
EEG monitoring duration was 83.9 hours on average per patient. Spectral power of EEG during drops of CPP was compared with epochs during normal CPP under the same levels of sedation. We found a significant decrease in faster EEG activity (3.5-20.7 Hz) during phases of low CPP (unaffected hemisphere P < 0.01, affected hemisphere P < 0.01, both P < 0.01).
Despite considerable changes in baseline activity due to deep sedation and severe brain injury, we found evidence for disturbed neuronal function during drops in CPP. Thus, continuous EEG monitoring may add clinically relevant information on neuronal function in the setting of multimodality brain monitoring.

The EEG parameters Bispectral index (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA, version XP) and Narcotrend index (MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany, version 4.0) were used as measures of the pharmacodynamic effect.
With IRB approval and informed consent we analyzed the data of three studies including 61 adult patients scheduled for radical prostatectomies. At least 45 min after induction of general anesthesia, end-tidal concentrations of desflurane, sevoflurane or isoflurane were varied between 0.5 and 2 MAC. We transferred the end-tidal concentrations into age-related MAC values. The relationship between MAC effect compartment concentrations and EEG was modeled with a variation of the classical fractional sigmoid E(max) model with two linked sigmoidal curves. All parameters were calculated as a population fit by NONMEM V (GloboMax, Hanover, USA) by minimizing log likelihood.
The k(e0) values of the population fit derived from BIS data were 0.54 min(-1) for desflurane, 0.24 min(-1) for sevoflurane and 0.16 min(-1) for isoflurane, from the Narcotrend index 0.43 min(-1) for desflurane, 0.26 min(-1) for sevoflurane and 0.18 min(-1) for isoflurane. The change between the first and the second sigmoidal curve was positioned at nearly the same Narcotrend- and BIS index values between 41 and 44.

Many of these monitors are based upon electroencephalography (EEG) collected from large adult reference populations and not pediatric populations (Anesthesiology, 86, 1997, 836; Journal of Anaesthesia, 92, 2004, 393; Anesthesiology, 99, 2003, 34). We hypothesized that EEG patterns in children would be different from those previously reported in adults and that they would show anesthetic-specific characteristics.
This prospective observational study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and informed written consent was obtained. Patients were randomized to receive maintenance anesthesia with isoflurane or sevoflurane. EEG data collection included at least 10 min at steady-state maintenance anesthesia. The EEG was recorded continuously through emergence until after extubation. A mixed model procedure was performed on global and regional power by pooled data analysis and by analyzing each anesthetic group separately. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.
Thirty-seven children completed the study (ages 22 days-3.6 years). Isoflurane and sevoflurane had different effects on global and regional EEG power during emergence from anesthesia, and frontal predominance patterns were significantly different between these two anesthetic agents.
The principal finding of the present study was that there are anesthetic-specific and concentration-dependent EEG effects in children.

This study aimed at investigating the relationship between changes in BIS values during natural sleep and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) variations, as measured by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Data were obtained from six young, healthy, right-handed, male volunteers (20-30 years old) using the H2(15)O infusion method. PET scans were performed both during waking and various stages of sleep. BIS values were monitored continuously and recorded during each PET scan. Positive correlations were detected between BIS and rCBF values in dorsolateral prefontal, parietal, anterior and posterior cingulate, precuneal, mesiofrontal, mesiotemporal and insular cortices. These areas belong to a frontoparietal network known to be related to awareness of self conscious sensory perception, attention and memory. BIS values also positively correlated with activity in brainstem and thalami, both structures known to be involved in arousal and wakefulness. These results show that BIS changes associated with physiological sleep depth co-vary with the activity of specific cortical and subcortical areas. The latter are known to modulate arousal, which in turn allows sustained thalamo-cortical enhancement of activity in a specific frontoparietal network known to be related to the content of consciousness.

One limitation of this study design is that MAC-based protocols are not sensitive to the use of intravenous agents, while EEG-based protocols are. Our objective was to develop a MAC alert that incorporates intravenous agents.
We developed an electronic algorithm and alerting system that calculates a total age-adjusted MAC value based on inhalational agents, but also incorporates intravenous agents. We retrospectively applied the algorithm to adult general anesthesia cases over a 1 year period to assess the frequency of alert triggers, using thresholds of <0.8, <0.7, <0.6, <0.5 and <0.4 age-adjusted MAC. We also electronically analyzed 12 cases of intraoperative awareness that occurred over a 4-year period for the frequency of alert triggers using the same thresholds. Finally, we calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios based on these analyses.
Over a 1-year period we identified 15,091 cases without self-reported awareness that were valid for analysis. At all age-adjusted MAC thresholds, the incidence of triggered alerts was higher in the awareness cases. The threshold of<0.8 age-adjusted MAC was associated with the highest negative likelihood ratio; the<0.5 age-adjusted MAC was associated with the highest positive likelihood ratio.
Our novel electronic alerting system incorporates both age-adjusted MAC and intravenous anesthesia, and triggers with a higher frequency in cases of awareness. These data suggest the potential for our system to alert clinicians to insufficient anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19669412/

Depth of anesthesia is a theoretical construct to conceptualize anesthetic effects on the central nervous system as discrete or continuous phases or states. Clinical signs for assessing anesthetic depth are currently being supplemented by brain monitors. Their use may help to prevent insufficient anesthesia, which can lead to intraoperative awareness with recall, as well as anesthetic overdose, which may be associated with adverse events. Commercial and open-source brain monitoring indices are computed from frequency, entropy, or information theoretic analysis of the spontaneous or evoked EEG. These techniques are undergoing refinement to determine the best method for titrating anesthetics. Future depth-of-anesthesia monitors will benefit from current work aimed at correlating anesthetic effects to alterations in specific neural circuits.
Current processed EEG monitors are limited by their calibration range and the interpatient variability in their dose-response curves. The next generation of depth-of-anesthesia monitors will require a greater understanding of the transformations of cortical and subcortical activity into EEG signals, the effects of anesthetics at a systems level, and the neural correlates of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19652597/

All currently available monitors need varying time periods to calculate a new index when reacting to changes in anaesthetic depth. The exact time delay for calculation of new index values is unknown. In a previous study, we used simulated EEG signals and found considerable time lags for the cerebral state index (Danmeter, Odense, Denmark), the bispectral index (Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Newton, MA, USA), and the Narcotrend index (MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the time delays observed with simulated EEG signals also applied to real EEG data.
We used perioperatively recorded EEG data from a database corresponding to the awake state, general anaesthesia, and suppression of cortical activity, respectively. After a switch from one state of consciousness to another, the time necessary for all indices to adjust the index value to the underlying input signal was measured.
We found time delays for all indices between 24 (7) and 122 (23) s before the new state was indicated. In accordance with our previous results, these time delays were not constant and depended on the particular starting and target index value. Results were different for decreasing and increasing values.
Our results may show a limitation of the value of electronic EEG indices in prevention of awareness with recall. Furthermore, due to different time delays for ascending and descending values, the results of pharmacodynamic studies may be influenced by this phenomenon.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19648154/

Our aim was to assess the impact of melatonin on the sleep EEG recording in comparison with chloral hydrate. Three hundred and forty eight patients (aged 1 month to 6 years) that were uncooperative with the EEG setup or referred for sleep EEG were enrolled in the study. Patients, partially sleep-deprived the night before, were randomly divided in two groups of melatonin and chloral hydrate on an alternative day basis, 174 patients in each group. Sleep onset latency in the chloral hydrate and melatonin groups was similar (Mann-Whitney test, P=0.113). However, sleep duration and drowsiness time were significantly shorter in the group of melatonin compared to the group of chloral hydrate (Mann-Whitney test, P<0.0001 and P<0.0001 respectively). More patients in the melatonin group (20 versus six patients in the chloral hydrate group) required a second dose of sedative for sleep induction (chi square test, P value=0.004). Seizure activities appeared in the electroencephalograms of 53% and 46% of patients in the melatonin and chloral hydrate groups respectively that were significantly higher in the melatonin group (chi square test, P=0.005). Few adverse effects occurred in both groups (Fisher's exact test, P=0.64). The shorter sleep duration and drowsiness period were the two advantages of melatonin over chloral hydrate.

As with any monitor, the processed numerical output is often misleading and has to be interpreted within a clinical context. For the safe clinical use of these monitors, a clear mental picture of the expected raw electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns, as well as a knowledge of the common EEG artifacts, is absolutely necessary. This has provided the motivation to write this tutorial. We describe, and give examples of, the typical EEG features of adequate general anesthesia, effects of noxious stimulation, and adjunctive drugs. Artifacts are commonly encountered and may be classified as arising from outside the head, from the head but outside the brain (commonly frontal electromyogram), or from within the brain (atypical or pathologic). We include real examples of clinical problem-solving processes. In particular, it is important to realize that an artifactually high qEEG index is relatively common and may result in dangerous anesthetic drug overdose. The anesthesiologist must be certain that the qEEG number is consistent with the apparent state of the patient, the doses of various anesthetic drugs, and the degree of surgical stimulation, and that the qEEG number is consistent with the appearance of the raw EEG signal. Any discrepancy must be a stimulus for the immediate critical examination of the patient's state using all the available information rather than reactive therapy to ""treat"" a number.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19608830/

The curriculum goal is to increase familiarity with EEG use and interpretation with 20 EEG interpretations with a clinical neurophysiologist during this rotation. We aimed to determine whether the EEG curriculum goals could be achieved with fewer EEG interpretations.
Each anesthesiology resident who participated interpreted 20 EEGs throughout the rotation. Using a 25-question evaluation tool, anesthesiology residents were assessed before interpreting any EEGs with a clinical neurophysiologist and reassessed after 10, 15, and 20 EEG interpretations. Each 25-item evaluation tool was developed to assess the impact of this EEG curriculum to gain experience with EEG monitoring and anesthetic effects using EEG tracings, and clinical EEG interpretation.
Eight residents completed the study. Mean scores improved from 8.00 +/- 2.51 at baseline to 15.12 +/- 3.00 (P < 0.001), 15.88 +/- 3.18 (P < 0.001), and 18.12 +/- 3.23 (P < 0.001) after 10, 15, and 20 EEG interpretations.

Although the efficacy of CEA in preventing stroke in selected patients has been clearly demonstrated, concern has been expressed about the role of CEA in people over 80 years old.
An analysis was conducted on a prospectively compiled computerized database of all primary CEAs performed at our institution from 1990 to 2007. Descriptive demographic data, risk factors, surgical details, perioperative strokes and deaths, and other complications were recorded. All patients underwent postoperative duplex ultrasound scanning and clinical follow-up at one, six, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier life-tables. Long-term relative survival after CEA was assessed against age- and gender-matched controls.
In all, 1769 CEAs were performed in 1562 patients, 193 of them (207 CEAs; group I) were > or = 80 years old and 1371 were younger (1562 CEAs; group II). All CEA procedures were performed with patients under deep general anesthesia with continuous perioperative EEG monitoring for selective shunting. No strokes or deaths occurred in group I, whereas there were 11 perioperative strokes and three deaths in group II (1%). A complete follow-up (median, 5.2 years) was obtained in 185 elderly patients: no late occlusions or restenoses were detected, while the seven-year freedom from stroke and death were 96.6% and 52.4%, respectively. The relative seven-year survival rate was 99.8%.
CEA in elderly patients proved safe and effective, with an excellent long-term durability. The long-term relative survival after CEA in elderly patients was better than in an age-and gender-matched population, so the likelihood of living long enough to benefit from CEA is not jeopardized by being very elderly.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19576719/

We analyzed the components of EEG that decrease the signal-to-noise ratio of somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) recordings during propofol anesthesia.
Patient EEGs were recorded with a high sampling frequency during deep anesthesia, when EEGs were in burst suppression. EEGs were segmented visually into bursts, spindles, suppressions, and artifacts. Tibial somatosensory evoked potentials (tSEPs) were averaged offline separately for burst, suppression, and spindle segments using a signal bandwidth of 30-200 Hz. Averages achieved with 2, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, and 256 responses were compared both visually, and by calculating the signal-to-noise ratios.
During bursts and spindles, the noise levels were similar and significantly higher than during suppressions. Four to eight times more responses had to be averaged during bursts and spindles than during suppressions in order to achieve a similar response quality. Averaging selectively during suppressions can therefore yield reliable tSEPs in approximately one-fifth of the time required during bursts.
The major source of EEG noise in tSEP recordings is the mixed frequency activity of the slow waves of bursts that occur during propofol anesthesia. Spindles also have frequency components that increase noise levels, but these are less important, as the number of spindles is fewer. The fastest way to obtain reliable tSEPs is by averaging selectively during suppressions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19565340/

In adults, independent of age, adequate and safe depth of anaesthesia for surgery is usually assumed when these indices are between 40 and 60. Since the EEG is changing with increasing age, we investigated the impact of advanced age on BIS, SE, and RE indices during induction.
BIS and SE/RE indices were recorded continuously in elderly (> or =65 yr) and young (< or =40 yr) surgical patients who received propofol until loss of consciousness (LOC) using stepwise increasing effect-site concentrations. LOC was defined as an observer assessment of alertness/sedation score <2, corresponding to the absence of response to mild prodding or shaking.
We analysed 35 elderly [average age, 78 yr (range, 67-96)] and 34 young [35 (19-40)] patients. At LOC, all indices were significantly higher in elderly compared with young patients: BIS(LOC), median 70 (range, 58-91) vs 58 (40-70); SE(LOC), 71 (31-88) vs 55.5 (23-79); and RE(LOC), 79 (35-96) vs 59 (25-80) (P<0.001 for all comparisons). With all three monitors, only a minority of elderly patients lost consciousness within a 40-60 index range: two (5.7%) with BIS and RE each, and seven (20%) with SE. In young patients, the respective numbers were 20 (58.8%) for BIS, 13 (38.2%) for SE, and nine (26.5%) for RE.

Lowering the brain temperature of patients with traumatic brain injuries achieves considerable improvements. When the human brain is cooled down to 30°C, it switches to a sub functional regime where it can live longer with less oxygen, glucose and other supplies. Fluctuations in brain temperature cause changes in brain parameters which can be measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) and transcranial Doppler (TCD). It is very important to understand the temperature dependencies of brain's electrical activity and blood flow and their interrelations considering the good clinical results achieved by lowering the brain temperature of neurologically injured patients. Since protecting the patient's brain is of primary importance in many fields including cardiology, neurology, traumatology and anesthesia it can be clearly seen that this subject is very important.

The growing interest in depth of anesthesia monitoring resulted in an intensified technological progress. Innovations on both hardware and mathematical algorithms were introduced for improving the extraction of data. Because of the abundance of monitors now commercially available, it becomes increasingly important to develop a standardized reproducible methodology for comparing depth of anesthesia monitors.

Training and testing the ANN have been used previous anaesthesia amount, total power/normal power and total power/previous. When Elman Resilient BP and feed-forward network are compared, it is observed that resilient back propagation algorithm has generated values which are quite close to the applied anesthesia amount compared to gdx which is an adaptive learning algorithm.

It was obtained from the algorithm based on the analysis of a large number of EEGs from volunteers and patients undergoing sedation and general anesthesia with different anesthetic agents. The use of BIS to monitor the depth of anesthesia reduces the incidence of intraoperative awakening and recall, among other benefits. The objective of this review was to present clinical situations in which the BIS gives false results, either elevated or decreased, due to conditions related to the patient or anesthetic actions unforeseen when the algorithm was elaborated.
The bispectral index can be altered and influenced in different clinical situations in which abnormal EEG patterns are present; the effects of different anesthetics and other drugs not included when the algorithm was elaborated; interference from electrical equipment; as well as peculiarities of the monitor.
Although the BIS algorithm underwent several changes since its first version, the anesthesiologist should be aware of situations that cause false BIS readings to avoid complications, may it be secondary to anesthetic overdose or underdosing, which might cause intraoperative awakening and recall.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19374221/

Children with cerebral palsy (CP) also benefit from the use of midazolam, but its effects on this group of patients, who present several particularities, including changes at the site of action of midazolam, are still unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of midazolam, when used as pre-anesthetic medication, on the bispectral index (EEG-BIS) of patients with cerebral palsy.
Two groups of patients were evaluated: one group with the diagnosis of CP and the other without central and peripheral nervous system disorders.

In the present study, we sought a combined EEG/AEP indicator that allows both separation of consciousness from unconsciousness and discrimination among different levels of sedation and hypnosis over a wider range of anesthesia.
Fifteen unpremedicated volunteers received mono-anesthesia with sevoflurane or propofol in a randomized crossover design in two consecutive sessions. Loss of consciousness (LOC) and EEG burst suppression (BSP) defined end-points from the upper and lower range of general anesthesia. In addition to those two extremes, the difference between anesthetic concentration at BSP and LOC was divided into three equal intervals, resulting in two intermediate levels which divided the concentration from LOC (minimum) to BSP (maximum) into three equal steps. This data set was used to test whether a previously described combined EEG/AEP indicator ""detector of consciousness"" can also discriminate among degrees of anesthetic effects from the awake state to BSP. Furthermore, a new improved combined EEG/AEP indicator was developed on the basis of the data from the current study, and subsequently this new indicator was tested for its ability to separate consciousness from unconsciousness with the patient data set.
The former ""detector of consciousness"" showed a prediction probability (P(K)) of 0.77 to separate different levels of anesthesia from the current study, whereas for the new combined EEG/AEP indicator, P(K) was 0.94. The new indicator was further applied to the previous study and achieved a P(K) of 0.89.
These results show that with the new indicator presented here, a combination of EEG and AEP parameters can be used to differentiate degrees of anesthetic effects over a wide range of hypnosis, from the conscious state to deep anesthesia (i.e., BSP).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19372330/

A new electroencephalographic (EEG) monitor, the EEGo, processes a raw EEG signal using time-delay analysis to display a reproducible signal transition from deep anesthesia through the excitement state to the awake state. We hypothesized that the EEGo monitor would be superior to the bispectral (BIS) monitor, not only in aiding emergence but also in detecting sudden changes in levels of hypnosis.
Twenty-one patients undergoing neurosurgery were studied (16 MVD, 5 cerebral aneurysm clipping). Each patient had both EEGo and BIS monitoring with only one monitor available for viewing by the anesthesiologist. The anesthetic was titrated based on the available monitor, and the time to emergence was measured. Intraoperative detection of arousal and the timing of burst suppression during propofol administration were also examined.
In the MVD patients, there was no statistical difference in wake-up times between the EEGo and BIS groups. Additionally, there were no episodes of intraoperative awareness and no differences in patient satisfaction. Compared to EEGo waveform output, a decrease in BIS output was delayed in four patients receiving propofol for burst suppression during cerebral aneurysm clipping, indicating enhanced hypnosis. One case of intraoperative arousal, which occurred at a BIS reading of 43 arbitrary BIS units, was detected earlier with the EEGo.
While the EEGo was faster than the BIS at indicating planned changes in levels of hypnosis throughout propofol administration prior to temporary clipping during aneurysm surgery, the EEGo was not superior to the BIS monitor in facilitating a more rapid emergence following neurosurgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19340492/

Twenty-four patients (ASA II or III, age 25-62 years, BMI 35.5-61.7) were randomly allocated to receive propofol target-controlled infusion based on a weight adjustment formula (group adjusted) or without adjustment [group total body weight (TBW)]. Anaesthesia was induced by a propofol-targeted concentration of 6 microg ml that was subsequently adapted to maintain stable bispectral index values ranging between 40 and 50. Arterial blood samples were collected before the start of the infusion and every 15 min thereafter to determine the predictive performances.
There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to performance errors, divergence and wobble. Results are presented as median (interquartiles). Median performance error and median absolute performance error were -31.7 (-35.9, -19.4) and 31.7% (20.2, 35.9) for group adjusted and -16.3 (-26.3, 2.2) and 20.6% (14.8, 26.9) for group TBW, respectively. Wobble median value was 7.4% (3.8, 8.4) for group adjusted and 8.2% (7.0, 9.6) for group TBW. As for wobble and divergence, no statistically significant differences were found between groups.

Many critically ill patients are given sedatives and paralytics to facilitate aeromedical transport. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is a computer-derived electroencephalography (EEG) analog currently used to monitor the level of awareness of sedated patients. It gives a score of 1-100, with 1 representing no brain function and 100 representing a completely alert patient. Objective. To evaluate whether critically ill patients are adequately sedated during aeromedical transport. Methods. This was a prospective, observational study of a convenience sample of critically ill patients transported by helicopter. All intubated patients who received sedatives and/or paralytics to facilitate transport were eligible for enrollment by the attending clinician. Prior to liftoff, a BIS sensor was applied to the patient's forehead. Minimum, maximum, and mean BIS index scores were recorded every minute during transport. Results. Forty-seven patients (57% male) were enrolled, with a median age of 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 18-81, range 14 to 86 years). The median duration of monitoring was 15.0- minutes (IQR 6.0-26.0, range 2 to 33). The median BIS score was 54.6 (IQR 38.6-67.3, range 28 to 89.5). Only two patients (4.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5% to 14.8%) had at least one BIS score greater than 85, the accepted threshold for recall. Conclusion.

Ten healthy volunteers were sedated in a stepwise manner with doses of either midazolam and remifentanil or dexmedetomidine and remifentanil. One week later the procedure was repeated with the remaining drug combination. The doses were adjusted to achieve three different sedation levels (Ramsay Scores 2, 3 and 4) and controlled by a computer-driven drug-delivery system to maintain stable plasma concentrations of the drugs. At each level of sedation, BIS and Entropy (response entropy and state entropy) values were recorded for 20 minutes. Baseline recordings were obtained before the sedative medications were administered.
Both inter-individual and intra-individual variability increased as the sedation level deepened. Entropy values showed greater variability than BIS(R) values, and the variability was greater during dexmedetomidine/remifentanil sedation than during midazolam/remifentanil sedation.
The large intra-individual and inter-individual variability of BIS and Entropy values in sedated volunteers makes the determination of sedation levels by processed electroencephalogram (EEG) variables impossible. Reports in the literature which draw conclusions based on processed EEG variables obtained from sedated intensive care unit (ICU) patients may be inaccurate due to this variability.

This study draws into question previously reported associations between epileptiform activity and DSLD probably because it examined a purer cohort of children with more severe language difficulties who did not have seizures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19207301/
19193890,Isoflurane-sensitive presynaptic R-type calcium channels contribute to inhibitory synaptic transmission in the rat thalamus.,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2009,"Joksovic PM, Weiergräber M, Lee W, Struck H, Schneider T, Todorovic SM","Because inhibitory synaptic transmission is a major mechanism of general anesthesia, we examined the effects of isoflurane on properties of GABAergic inhibitory currents in the reticular thalamic nucleus (nRT) in brain slices. The evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs) and spontaneous miniature synaptic currents (mIPSCs) of visualized nRT cells in young and adult rats were recorded. Consistent with postsynaptic effects on GABA(A) receptors, isoflurane prolonged the decay-time constants of both eIPSCs and mIPCSs. Surprisingly, isoflurane completely inhibited the amplitude of eIPSCs at clinically relevant concentrations (IC(50) of 240+/-20 microm), increased the paired-pulse ratio, and decreased the frequency of mIPSCs, indicating that presynaptic mechanisms may also contribute to the effects of isoflurane on IPSCs. The overall effect of isoflurane on eIPSCs in nRT cells was a decrease of net charge-transfer across the postsynaptic membrane. The application of 100 microm nickel (Ni(2+)) and the more specific R-type Ca(2+) channel blocker SNX-482 (0.5 microm) decreased eIPSC amplitudes, increased the paired-pulse ratio, and attenuated isoflurane-induced inhibition of eIPSCs. In addition, isoflurane potently blocked currents in recombinant human Ca(V)2.3 (alpha1E) channels with an IC(50) of 206 +/- 22 mum. Importantly, in vivo electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in adult Ca(V)2.3 knock-out mice demonstrated alterations in isoflurane-induced burst-suppression activity. Because the thalamus has a key function in processing sensory information, sleep, and cognition, modulation of its GABAergic tone by presynaptic R-type Ca(2+) channels may contribute to the clinical effects of general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19193890/

The monitors of depth of anesthesia, based on the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), have been progressively introduced into the daily practice to provide additional information about the state of the patient. In this work, the Index of Consciousness (IoC), a recent index which uses the information from EEG spectrum and symbolic dynamics through a fuzzy inference system, is introduced. The bispectral index BIS, a well-established index, is used to validate the IoC. A good correlation is found between both indexes. Furthermore, IoC presents a significantly higher prediction probability Pk of the level of sedation than BIS, and can thus be considered as an interesting measure of the level of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19163975/

It also studies the association between the conventional depth of anesthesia index, BIS (Aspect Medical Systems), and EEG gamma and EMG activity. Data has been collected from 21 adult patients and grouped into young adults (18 - 39 yrs, n=3), middle-aged (40 - 64 yrs, n=10) and the elderly (65+ yrs, n=8). The power of the EEG gamma activity was recorded from Fpz - Mastoid and the power of the EMG was recorded from Fpz - Mastoid and Masseter - Mastoid. It has been found that when considered alone, EEG gamma power is associated with both BIS index and consciousness versus unconsciousness, showing a decrease in power as consciousness is lost. When the effect of EEG gamma power is adjusted for EMG, it is found that generally these associations can be explained by the EMG power alone. There are two exceptions to this. In the young adults group there is a stronger association between BIS index and EEG gamma than there is between BIS index and EMG. In the elderly group, the state of consciousness is equally associated with EEG gamma and EMG recorded from the Masseter, but not with the EMG recorded from Fpz.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19162784/

The EEGs of the frontal, central, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes were measured. Generally, the EEGs increased at large amplitude in the all lobe during electro-acupuncture (EA) stimulation of PC5 and PC6. According to the present experiments, after the EA stimulation of PC5, EEG was verified to change at an extremely large amplitude in the temporal lobe. A comparison of biological active points (BAPs) and non-BAPs in bioimpedance measurement experiments revealed that reactance resistance had low-resistance characteristics and characteristics frequency had frequency characteristics. The ECG heart rate decreased at PC6 and increased at PC5. PC6 therefore may have a certain effect on sedation of the human nervous system. We applied CWT to detect short-time event and the result image representation of the signal has showed us that one can easily find the discontinuity at the time scale representation. The results of the present study verified that the EA stimulation of BAPs (PC5, PC6) affects EEG, human bioimpedance, and ECG heart rate, and such stimulation may be capable of affecting the nervous system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19162749/

In this situation continuous EEG offers a convenient, effective method of monitoring the depth of sedation, using spectral edge frequency (SEF) to quantify EEG activity. The authors report 3 patients with severe Guillain-Barré syndrome managed with sedation aimed at a SEF95 below 4.0 Hz (delta coma), using a subhairline montage with the DATEX bedside EEG module. Two of the patients were easily managed using this system for an average of 16 days, and both were completely amnestic of this period of time with no serious complication. The third one had still some residual muscle activity and SEF was unreliable in this case, so its use was abandoned. Continuous EEG monitoring using SEF is a useful tool to manage sedation in the most severely paralyzed Guillain-Barré syndrome patients. Incorporation of a low-pass filter would be of benefit to remove any residual muscle activity, which confounds the target level of sedation with this method; SEF has theoretical advantages over the bispectral index in this population.

However, there are suggestions that EEG derived anesthesia depth monitors have inferior performance in infants. The aim of this study was to quantify the degree of sedation during spinal anesthesia in infants using another EEG derived measure of anesthesia effect--the Cerebral State Index (CSI).
Twelve infants, <52 weeks postconceptual menstrual age, scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair under spinal anesthesia were enrolled. Patients received a standard anesthetic protocol with a subarachnoid dose of 1 mg x kg(-1) of levobupivacaine 0.5%. No premedication, sedatives, opioids or anticholinergics were administrated during the perioperative period and patients were left undisturbed during the surgical time, without tactile stimulation or loud auditory stimuli. CSI score (0-100) and bust suppression (BS) (0-100%) were continuously recorded during the surgical time and then statistically re-evaluated.
In all patients the CSI fell during the procedure and there were significant levels of BS recorded by the CSI monitor. The BS occurred between 12 and 34 min after spinal anesthesia with the peak being at 30 min and mean onset time being 15 (2.6) min after spinal block. A statistical significant difference was found between the lowest mean CSI as well as the highest BS if compared with their baseline values. A negative correlation was found between CSI and BS.
The degree of burst suppression detected by the CSI in our study supports the hypothesis that infants may have discontinuous patterns of EEG during spinal anesthesia similar to those seen during emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, the limitations in the application of the adult algorithms to infant EEG may lead to an overestimation of the degree of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19143957/

Here, we analyzed the functional organization of brain activities in the conscious and anesthetized states, based on functional segregation and integration. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were obtained from 14 subjects undergoing induction of general anesthesia with propofol. We quantified changes in mean information integration capacity in each band of the EEG. After induction with propofol, mean information integration capacity was reduced most prominently in the gamma band of the EEG (p=.0001). Furthermore, we demonstrate that loss of consciousness is reflected by the breakdown of the spatiotemporal organization of gamma waves. We conclude that induction of general anesthesia with propofol reduces the capacity for information integration in the brain.

Published recordings have been performed with a limited number of channels, and therefore the topographic distributions of these patterns are not known.
Twenty ASA I children aged 4-10 years undergoing routine operations were anaesthetized with 8% sevoflurane in 50%/50% oxygen and nitrous oxide using mask induction with controlled normoventilation. An EEG was recorded with a full 10-20 electrode system including orbitofrontal and ear electrodes, and a recording band of 0.016-70 Hz. Beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) was calculated off-line.
Nineteen out of 20 children developed multifocal spikes and polyspikes with a maximum over the frontal lobes. Four patients developed suppression, which was almost continuous and lasted several minutes, and thereafter a continuous EEG resumed, a few spikes were seen and then a nonepileptiform pattern. In three children a couple of PED waves were seen at the onset of a continuous EEG. HR increased maximally before the onset of spikes. No motor phenomena were seen.
These recordings confirm the epileptogenic property of sevoflurane in mask induction. The spikes and polyspikes had frontal multifocal maxima and may be missed in recordings from frontopolar electrodes used by depth-of-anaesthesia monitors. PED and burst suppression were synchronous over the whole cortex.

The SCA reacts immediately and is not influenced by hemodynamic variability or neuromuscular blockade. The use of SCA for pain and nociceptive assessment is outlined in this review.
When pain was monitored by verbal reporting in postoperative patients, the SCA had a sensitivity of about 90% and specificity up to 74% to identify the pain, better than heart rate and blood pressure. In general anesthetized patients, both the sensitivity and specificity were about 90% to detect responses to noxious stimulation when compared with clinical stress variables. The SCA reflects changes in norepeinephrine levels induced by nociception better than heart rate, blood pressure, and electroencephalograph (EEG) monitors. Unlike EEG monitors, the SCA response is sensitive to experimental noxious stimuli during general anesthesia, and the measured response was attenuated by analgesic medication. This SCA response is significantly associated with genetically modulated pain sensitivity. Moreover, noxious stimuli in artificially ventilated patients and in preterm infants increase the SCA index, and the increase correlates to the clinical discomfort.
The SCA detects nociceptive pain fast and continuously, specific to the individual, with higher sensitivity and specificity than other available objective methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18997532/

As in recent studies attempting to correlate frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements with clinical evaluations of sedative efficacy, there is considerable overlap in numerical EEG values and different clinical levels of sedation. This precludes the use of these monitors for monitoring or titrating sedation in the critically ill. Despite many attempts, no study has yet presented data showing improved outcome with the use of EEG monitors in ICU sedation. Meanwhile, clinical sedation protocols have emerged, improving important endpoints in critically ill patients needing sedation. A major underlying problem in applying EEG monitors in the ICU is that they have been developed for measuring anesthetic depth and the related risk of recall, rather than the acknowledged endpoints of sedation, namely reduction of anxiety and discomfort. Until an 'objective' monitor is developed to measure the degree of such symptoms, physicians should continue treating patients and not numbers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18983711/

We evaluate the effect of TIVA on interictal spikes in children who have intractable epilepsy with or without MRI lesions.
We studied 28 children (3-14 years; mean, 6.6). We intravenously administered propofol (30-60 microg/kg/min) to record MEG with simultaneous EEG. We evaluated MEG spike sources (MEGSSs). We compared spikes on simultaneous EEG under TIVA with those on scalp video-EEG without TIVA.
There was a significant decrease in frequent spikes (10 patients, 36%) on simultaneous EEG under TIVA compared to those (22 patients, 79%) on scalp video-EEG without TIVA (P<0.01). MEGSSs were present in 21 (75%) of 28 patients. Clustered MEGSSs occurred in 15 (83%) of 18 lesional patients but in 3 (30%) of 10 nonlesional patients (P<0.05). MEGSSs were more frequently absent in nonlesional (6 patients, 60%) than lesional (one patient, 5%) patients (P<0.01).

Propofol-based TIVA reduced interictal spikes on simultaneous EEG. TIVA for MEG still had utility in identifying spike sources in a subset of pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy who were uncooperative and surgical candidates. In lesional patients, MEG under TIVA frequently localized the clustered MEGSSs. Neuronal migration disorders were intrinsically epileptogenic and produced clustered MEGSSs under TIVA.

Several methods based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) have been proposed to estimate the depth of anesthesia (DoA); for instance, the Fourier-based time-frequency balanced spectral entropy as implemented in the Datex-Ohmeda M-Entropy Module. In this paper, a novel method based on Hilbert-Huang transform is proposed to calculate a spectral entropy value, called Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy and is applied to EEG recordings during sevoflurane anesthesia. The dose-response relation of Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy during sevoflurane anesthesia is presented.
We analyzed a previously collected set of EEG data, obtained from 14 patients' during the induction of general anesthesia with sevoflurane. The Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy and the Datex-Ohmeda M-Entropy were applied to the EEG recording. State entropy and response entropy based on the Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy and the Datex-Ohmeda M-Entropy were calculated, respectively. The performance of both methods was assessed by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling and prediction probability. To obtain reliable Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy and Datex-Ohmeda M-Entropy values, a combined preprocessor was applied in advance.
In the awake state, the baseline variability (as estimated by the coefficient of variation) of the Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy was less than half the variability of the Datex-Ohmeda M-Entropy (p<0.001). All entropy values decreased similarly with increasing sevoflurane concentration, as shown by the high correlation between the respective methods (p<0.001). However, Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy exhibited greater resistance to noise in the EEG signal; and decreased in a more linear fashion with increasing sevoflurane effect-site concentration, particularly around the point of loss of consciousness. The goodness-of-fit of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model and the prediction probability using the state entropy of Hilbert-Huang spectrum (R2=0.86, P(k)=0.84) was significantly better than that using the one of M-Entropy (R2=0.80, P(k)=0.81, p<0.05); however, the difference between response entropy values was not statistically significant.
The results from this small dataset suggest that the Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy has a slightly stronger ability to track changes in sevoflurane effect-site concentration than M-Entropy with a stronger noise-resistance.
Hilbert-Huang spectral entropy could be incorporated in the design of a new method to estimate the effect of anesthetic drugs on the EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18812265/

Of the background in the practice of ECT, hyperventilation may augment the seizure duration. To elucidate these hypotheses, we performed double-blind randomized controlled trial for 19 patients. They were divided into 2 groups, according to the end-tidal pressure of carbon dioxide (ETCO2): The moderate hyperventilation group with ETCO2 of 30 mm Hg and the normal ventilation group with ETCO2 of 40 mm Hg. ECT was performed under general anesthesia with propofol and suxamethonium. During ECT electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram were recorded. The Global Assessment of Functioning scores were also analyzed before and after 6 sequential ECT. The moderate hyperventilation group showed a significant increase in EEG seizure duration in the first treatment compared with the normal ventilation group (P < 0.05). However, EEG seizure duration in the subsequent treatments and electromyogram seizure duration in all the treatments did not differ between 2 groups. The moderate hyperventilation did not prevent the increase in seizure threshold or shortening of seizure duration. No complications or sever adverse effects were observed after ECT in any of the 6 treatments.

Initially, patients received a single dose of intravenous piritramide 0.1 mg x kg(-1), followed by propofol 2 mg x kg(-1) and, if necessary, additional propofol doses (0.5 mg x kg(-1)) to achieve and maintain a level of deep sedation throughout the procedure. Sedation was assessed by the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS). We investigated the relationship between depth of sedation, and the NI, and the classical EEG parameters (cEEG), total EEG power (Power), spectral edge (SEF) and median frequency, and relative power in the beta, alpha, theta and delta bands. The performance of the NI and cEEG parameters was evaluated by prediction probability (P(K)), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Spearman rank order correlation analysis.
Mean P(K) values for NI (0.88) vs UMSS were higher than for the other cEEG parameters, except for Power (0.82) and SEF(0.81). Spearman correlation analysis revealed superiority of the NI over all cEEG parameters. The area under the curve for the NI was 0.93, which was superior to all other EEG parameters beside Power (0.86) and relative power in alpha (0.82).

Hardware may require customization to enable a variety of recording types (e.g., electroencephalogram, local field potentials, or multi-unit activity) while meeting the stringent and costly requirements of MRI safety and compatibility. Real-time signal processing tools are an enabling technology for studies of learning, attention, sleep, epilepsy, neurofeedback, and neuropharmacology, yet real-time signal processing tools are difficult to develop.

The hardware distribution provides the complete specifications required to build an MRI-compatible electrophysiological data acquisition system, including circuit schematics, print circuit board (PCB) layouts, Gerber files for PCB fabrication and robotic assembly, a bill of materials with part numbers, data sheets, and vendor information, and test procedures. The software facilitates rapid implementation of real-time signal processing algorithms. This system has been used in human EEG/fMRI studies at 3 and 7T examining the auditory system, visual system, sleep physiology, and anesthesia, as well as in intracranial electrophysiological studies of the non-human primate visual system during 3T fMRI, and in human hyperbaric physiology studies at depths of up to 300 feet below sea level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761038/

The inclusion was consecutive and based on the availability of the electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring equipment. Patients were included irrespective of pupil size, pupil reaction, or level of consciousness as long as their first measured cerebral perfusion pressure was > 10 mm Hg. The patients were treated in a protocol-guided manner with an ICP-targeted treatment based on the Lund concept. The patients were continuously sedated with midazolam, fentanyl, propofol, or thiopental, or combinations thereof. Five-lead continuous EEG monitoring was performed with the electrodes at F3, F4, P3, P4, and a midline reference. Sensitivity was set at 100 muV per cm and filter settings 0.5-70 Hz. Amplitude-integrated EEG recording and relative band power trends were displayed. The trends were analyzed offline by trained clinical neurophysiologists.

All patients were induced with sevoflurane 8%, until the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS) scale level 1 was reached, and then was set at a 1% end-tidal sevoflurane concentration. Subsequently, remifentanil and atracurium were administered, the trachea was intubated, and the procedure continued as usual. To assess accuracy, the prediction probability (Pk) was calculated both during induction and during maintenance.
The Pk values [mean (se)] for IoC, BIS, and CSI during induction were 0.90 (0.01), 0.90 (0.01), and 0.88 (0.01), respectively, whereas the corresponding Pk values during maintenance were 0.95 (0.01), 0.94 (0.01), and 0.60 (0.01).
The three indices performed equally well during the induction phase and were able to predict the level of consciousness of the patients satisfactorily. During maintenance, the IoC and the BIS showed good agreement with the clinical signs. The CSI was significantly influenced by the administration of atracurium; therefore, the agreement with the OAAS scale during the maintenance phase was significantly less for CSI than for IoC and BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18723856/
18639412,Cerebral oximetry does not correlate with electroencephalography and somatosensory evoked potentials in determining the need for shunting during carotid endarterectomy.,Journal of vascular surgery,2008,"Friedell ML, Clark JM, Graham DA, Isley MR, Zhang XF","Several reports in the literature have described the value of regional cerebral oximetry (rSO(2)) as a neuromonitoring device during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The use of rSO(2) is enticing because it is simpler and less expensive than other neuromonitoring modalities. This study was performed to compare the efficacy of rSO(2) with electroencephalography (EEG) and median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) in determining when to place a shunt during CEA.
From October 2000 to June 2006, 323 CEAs were performed under general anesthesia by six surgeons. Shunting was done selectively on the basis of EEG and SSEP monitoring under the auspices of an intraoperative neurophysiologist. All patients were retrospectively reviewed to see if significant discrepancies existed between EEG/SSEP and rSO(2).
Twenty-four patients (7.4%) showed significant discrepancies. Sixteen patients showed no significant EEG/SSEP changes, but profound changes occurred in rSO(2), and no shunt was placed. In seven patients there was no change in rSO(2) but a profound change occurred in EEG/SSEP, and shunts were placed. In one patient early in the series, the EEG and SSEP were unchanged but the rSO(2) dropped precipitously, and a shunt was placed. In the 299 patients who showed no discrepancies, 285 were not shunted and 14 required a shunt. Two strokes occurred in the entire series (0.6%), none intraoperatively. Shunts were placed in 23 patients (7%). The sensitivity of rSO(2) compared with EEG/SSEP was 68%, and the specificity was 94%. This gave a positive-predictive value of 47% and a negative-predictive value of 98%.
Relying on rSO(2) alone for selective shunting is potentially dangerous and might have led to intraoperative ischemic strokes in seven patients and the unnecessary use of shunts in at least 16 patients in this series. The use of rSO(2) adds nothing to the information already provided by EEG and SSEP in determining when to place a shunt during CEA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18639412/

Loss of consciousness (LOC) was repetitively induced by bolus injections of propofol in 24 patients undergoing elective surgery in spinal anaesthesia. SSEP and the BIS were recorded during LOC and recovery of consciousness (ROC). The level of consciousness was clinically assessed by the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale. Propofol venous plasma concentrations were measured simultaneously.
At LOC, all SSEPs latency components were prolonged (P<0.001), whereas amplitudes of the components > or = 45 ms were smaller (P=0.008) and the BIS values were lower (P<0.001). None of the EEG variables regained baseline levels during ROC. Regression analyses revealed that the SSEP components (five latencies and five amplitudes) explained 33% of the variance when predicting ROC; the BIS explained 12%. The combination of SSEP and BIS explained 37% of variance in this patient sample. Propofol venous plasma concentration was 1.2 (0.8) microg ml(-1) during LOC and 0.4 (0.5) microg ml(-1) during ROC.
The present results indicate the usefulness of combining variables of the evoked and spontaneous EEG to measure different levels of consciousness, because the SSEP provide additional information beyond the BIS. Inter-individual variability of all the EEG variables limits their predictive potency of ROC after propofol infusion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18587138/
18563068,Inhaled anesthesia: the original closed-loop drug administration paradigm.,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2008,"Gupta DK, Eger EI",We administer anesthetics to obtain therapeutic effects and minimize untoward side effects. Anesthetists can precisely control inhaled anesthetic concentrations by controlling end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentrations. This degree of control eliminates the need for closed-loop inhaled anesthetic systems. The low solubility of modern inhaled anesthetics adds to the stability and control of the anesthetic state; the effective inhaled concentration varies little during maintenance of anesthesia unless altered by the anesthetist. A less precise closed-loop system applies a processed electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess depth of anesthesia and enable accurate delivery of volatile and intravenous anesthetics to maintain a stable state of anesthesia.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18563068/

In an earlier study, we showed that remifentanil provides superior anesthesia for ECT in terms of providing adequate seizure duration with lower stimulus doses in patients refractory to maximal ECT settings with methohexital.
Patients, refractory to maximal ECT settings with methohexital, received remifentanil as the sole anesthetic agent. Stimulus dose was determined by the dose-titration method. Electroencephalographic seizure duration, motor seizure duration, and dynamic energy in joules (j) were compared between male and female subjects and among patients aged 40 years or younger, older than 40 years but aged 65 years or younger, and older than 65 years.
Seventy-two patients were included in the study. There was no significant difference in remifentanil doses between female and male subjects. There was no significant statistical difference between female and male subjects regarding motor seizure duration, EEG seizure duration, or dynamic energy (P > 0.05). There were significant statistical differences among different groups in terms of motor seizure duration, EEG seizure duration, and dynamic energy (P< 0.05). The younger age group had longer motor and EEG seizure durations and required lower dynamic energy.
There is no significant effect of sex on ECT with remifentanil anesthesia regarding EEG or motor seizure durations or dynamic energy; however, statistically significant differences were observed based upon age. Younger patients had both increased motor and EEG seizure duration compared with older patients who may require higher stimulus doses than younger patients for comparable motor and EEG seizure durations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18562948/

Multi-channel EEG recorded from 12 ASA 1 (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1) patients during low-dose, target effect-site controlled propofol infusion was used for this analysis. The initial target effect-site concentration was 0.5 microg ml(-1) and increased at 4 min intervals in increments of 0.5 to 2 microg ml(-1). EEG parameters were calculated for 2 s epochs in the frequency ranges 0.5-32 and 0.5-47 Hz. All parameters were calculated in the channels: P4-O2, P3-O1, F4-C4, F3-C3, F3-F4, and Fp1-Fp2. Sedation was assessed clinically using the OAA/S (observer's assessment of alertness/sedation) scale.
Relative beta power and spectral entropy increased with increasing propofol effect-site concentration in both the 0.5-47 Hz [F(18, 90) = 3.455, P<0.05 and F(18, 90) = 3.33, P<0.05, respectively] and 0.5-32 Hz frequency range. This effect was significant in each individual channel (P<0.05). No effect was seen of increasing effect-site concentration on relative power in the alpha band. Averaged across all channels, spectral entropy did not outperform relative beta power in either the 0.5-32 Hz [Pk=0.79 vs 0.814 (P>0.05)] or 0.5-47 Hz range [Pk=0.81 vs 0.82 (P>0.05)]. The best performing indicator in any single channel was spectral entropy in the frequency range 0.5-47 Hz in the frontal channel F3-F4 (Pk=0.85).
Relative beta power and spectral entropy when considered over the propofol effect-site range studied here increase in value, and correlate well with clinical assessment of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18550642/

Recently, acute normovolaemic haemodilution (ANH) was shown to be associated with significant impairment of cognitive functions that could alter EEG and consequently BIS monitoring, an EEG derived parameter.
In a randomised clinical study, we assessed the effect of ANH on BIS monitoring before induction and after propofol target controlled infusion (TCI) anaesthesia in 45 unmedicated patients randomly allocated to ANH with oxygen insufflation (oxygen group), ANH with air insufflation (air group), or control group.
With ANH, mean BIS values briefly declined in the oxygen group (82+/-4) and air group (84+/-3) before returning to baseline values. The loss of consciousness time was significantly shorter, with fewer propofol TCI dose requirements, and BIS was significantly higher in the oxygen group (1.3+/-0.5 min, 2.41+/-0.15 microg/ml, 73+/-7) and air group (1.2+/-0.6 min, 2.44+/-0.17 microg/ml, 75+/-5), compared with the control group (1.7+/-0.4 min, 2.75+/-0.17 microg/ml, 61+/-5), respectively. Whereas, there was no significant difference in BIS values between the oxygen group (38+/-7), air group (36+/-5) and control group (40+/-6) at propofol TCI 4 microg/ml anaesthesia maintenance.

Long-duration, multi-site forebrain field recordings were performed in urethane-anaesthetized rats. A spontaneous and rhythmic alternation of brain state between activated and deactivated electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns was observed. Individual states and their transitions resembled the REM/nREM cycle of natural sleep in their EEG components, evolution, and time frame ( approximately 11 minute period). Other physiological variables such as muscular tone, respiration rate, and cardiac frequency also covaried with forebrain state in a manner identical to sleep. The brain mechanisms of state alternations under urethane also closely overlapped those of natural sleep in their sensitivity to cholinergic pharmacological agents and dependence upon activity in the basal forebrain nuclei that are the major source of forebrain acetylcholine. Lastly, stimulation of brainstem regions thought to pace state alternations in sleep transiently disrupted state alternations under urethane.
Our results suggest that urethane promotes a condition of behavioural unconsciousness that closely mimics the full spectrum of natural sleep. The use of urethane anaesthesia as a model system will facilitate mechanistic studies into sleep-like brain states and their alternations. In addition, it could also be exploited as a tool for the discovery of new molecular targets that are designed to promote sleep without compromising state alternations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18414674/

Bispectral (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA, version XP) and Narcotrend (NCT, MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany, Version 4.0) indices were used as an electroencephalographic measure of desflurane drug effect.
With IRB approval and informed consent we investigated 20 adult patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy. At least 45 minutes after induction of general anaesthesia, end-tidal concentrations of desflurane was varied between 3 and 10 vol%. To evaluate the relationship between concentrations and EEG indices, two different pharmacodynamic models were applied: A conventional model based on a single sigmoidal curve, and a novel model based on two sigmoidal curves for BIS and NCT values with and without burst suppression. The parameters of the models were estimated by NONMEM V (GloboMax, Hanover, USA) by minimizing log likelihood. Statistical significance between the two models was calculated by the likelihood ratio test.
The maximum end-tidal desflurane concentration during the two concentrations ramps was 10.0 +/- 1.4 vol%. The mean BIS and NCT values decreased significantly but slightly with increasing end-tidal desflurane concentrations between 4 and 8 vol%. Therefore a two sigmoidal curves PK/PD model including a plateau describes the effects of desflurane on BIS and Narcotrend better than a single sigmoidal curve model. The difference between the log likelihood values of the new PK/PD model with two connected sigmoidal curves and the classical E (max )model with one sigmoidal curve is 634 (P < 0.001) for the BIS monitor and 4089 (P < 0.001) for the NCT.

It is critical to the diagnosis and management of seizure disorders, such as epilepsy, as well as other neurological conditions. The EEG procedure is often not well tolerated by children with developmental disabilities because of anxiety about unfamiliar equipment, difficulty inhibiting motion, and tactile defensiveness. The inability of children with developmental disabilities to tolerate an EEG procedure is especially problematic because the incidence of epilepsy is considerably higher in children with disabilities. This clinical outcome study sought to determine the efficacy of using behavioral intervention to teach children with developmental disorders to cooperate with an EEG procedure.

To realize more appropriate anesthesia, we have developed a hypnosis control system, which administers propofol as an anesthetic drug to regulate the bispectral index (BIS), an electroencephalography (EEG)-derived index reflecting the hypnosis of a patient. This system consists of three functions: 1) a feedback controller using a model-predictive control method, which can adequately accommodate the effects of time delays; 2) a parameter estimation function of individual differences; and 3) a risk control function for preventing undesirable states such as drug overinfusion or intraoperative arousal.

Our goal in this observational study was to map brain regions whose activity is modified by clonidine infusion so as to better understand its loci of action, especially in relation to sedation.
Six ASA I-II right-handed volunteers were recruited. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was monitored continuously. After a baseline H2(15)O activation scan, clonidine infusion was started at a rate ranging from 6 to 10 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1). A sequence of 11 similar scans was then performed at 8 min intervals. Plasma clonidine concentration was measured. Using statistical parametric mapping, we sought linear correlations between normalized regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), an indicator of regional brain activity, and plasma clonidine concentration or spindle EEG activity.
Clonidine induced clinical sedation and EEG patterns (spindles) comparable to early stage nonrapid eye movement sleep. A significant negative linear correlation between clonidine concentration and rCBF or spindle activity was observed in the thalamus, prefrontal, orbital and parietal association cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus.
The EEG patterns and decreases in rCBF of specific brain regions observed during clonidine-induced sedation are similar to those of early stage nonrapid eye movement sleep.

18175101,Anesthetics drug pharmacodynamics.,Handbook of experimental pharmacology,2008,"Bischoff P, Schneider G, Kochs E","Anesthesia cannot be defined in an unambiguous manner. The essential components of general anesthesia are absence of consciousness and pain. This translates into two particular qualities: (1) sedation and hypnosis, i.e., mental blockade and (2) analgesia/antinociception, i.e., sensory blockade. Anesthetic actions on these two subcomponents are difficult to separate. On the one hand, very few anesthetics act exclusively on one of these components. On the other hand, these components are closely related to each other. Unconsciousness prevents (conscious) perception of pain, and nociception may serve as an arousal stimulus and change the level of sedation and hypnosis. The art of anesthesia lies in adequate dosing of drugs to reach both mental and sensory blockade. Drug administration can be based on pharmacokinetic considerations. Pharmacokinetic models allow an estimation of what happens to the administered drug in the body. Models with an effect site compartment may facilitate a tailored administration of anesthetic drugs. Finally, the quantification of pharmacodynamic effects allows a precise titration of drugs. Clinical assessment of mental blockade is often dichotomous, and therefore not very helpful to guide drug administration. Several scoring systems exist, but once consciousness is lost they become less reliable, in particular because reaction to stimuli is assessed, which mixes assessment of mental blockade with assessment of sensory blockade. Clinical assessment of analgesia requires a conscious patient, so antinociception is difficult to measure. Several methods of objective quantification on the basis of electrical brain activity are discussed including EEG and evoked potentials. Despite numerous indexes of the hypnotic component of anesthesia, there is no parameter that unambiguously quantifies the level of mental or sensory blockade.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18175101/

This may have disadvantages when propofol is used to provide total intravenous anaesthesia or especially during long-term sedation. There has been considerable interest in the development of new propofol formulations or propofol prodrugs. GPI 15715 or fospropofol (Aquavan injection; Guilford Pharmaceutical, Baltimore, MD) is the first water-soluble prodrug that has been thoroughly studied in human volunteers and patients. GPI 15751 or fospropofol is cleaved by alkaline phosphatase to phosphate, formaldehyde and propofol. Formaldehyde is rapidly metabolised to formate. Although a formate accumulation is the principal pathomechanism responsible for the toxicity of methanol ingestion, so far there has been no report of toxicity due to the administration of fospropofol or other phosphate ester prodrugs, such as fosphenytoin. Fosphenytoin has been successfully introduced into the market for the treatment of status epilepticus in 1996. The main side-effects were a feeling of paraesthesia after rapid i.v. administration of GPI 15715 or fospropofol, which has also been described for fosphenytoin. The pharmacokinetics of GPI 15715 or fospropofol could be described by a combined pharmacokinetic model with a submodel of two compartments for GPI 15715 and of three compartments for propofol(G). The liberated propofol(G) compared to lipid-formulated propofol showed unexpected pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences. We found a significantly greater V(c), V(dss), significantly shorter alpha- and beta-half-life and a longer MRT (mean residence time) for propofol(G). The pharmacodynamic potency of propofol(G) appears to be higher than propofol when measured by EEG and clinical signs of hypnosis.

Review of literature.
There are no prospective, randomized works comparing the effects of anesthetics in the treatment of RSE. Recently, the use of propofol has increased in the treatment of RSE. Propofol terminates both clinical and electric seizures quickly, but the maintenance of burst-suppression EEG pattern requires repetitive titration of doses. Relapses of seizures have occurred in 19-33% of patients, especially when tapering of dose. The advantages of barbiturates are lower frequency of short-term treatment failures, breakthrough seizures and changes to a different anesthetic agent. On the other hand, prolonged recovery leads to prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care and hospital stay.
The use of propofol, barbiturates or midazolam in the anesthesia of RSE can be justified. When using propofol, the duration of high doses should be limited to 48 hours and the risk of propofol infusion syndrome should be kept in mind. High doses of barbiturates terminate effectively seizures but recovery from anesthesia prolongs ventilator treatment and intensive care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18173905/

In Asperger's syndrome, epileptiform spikes were mostly found in the right hemisphere. No lateralized epileptiform activity was observed in non-Asperger's autistic patients.
MEG epileptiform activity is frequently documented in children with early-onset ASD.
Subclinical epileptiform activity is present especially in the perisylvian regions for many patients with ASD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18164240/

An understanding of the EEG during anesthesia may help explain and predict the performance of EEG-derived depth of anesthesia monitors in children. This study aims to describe the association between age and some basic characteristics of the EEG during nonstandardized anesthesia in children and infants.
Sixty-four children aged 9 days to 12 years were enrolled in this observational physiological study. Anesthesia was given at the discretion of the anesthetist. EEG was recorded from after induction to emergence using a BRM2 brain monitor ''BrainZ Instruments, Auckland, New Zealand'' in parietal and frontal montages. For comparison, 90% spectral edge frequency (SEF-90) and power were determined at three points (equilibrium during anesthesia, when the volatile agent was discontinued and at emergence), and children were divided into three age groups (0-6 months, 6-24 months and 2-12 years).
Fifty-seven children had artifact-free EEG data. From equilibrium to emergence the mean forehead power decreased substantially in children aged 2-12 years (3171-153 microV(2), P < 0.001) and 6-24 months (756-140 microV(2), P < 0.001) but no difference was found in infants aged 0-6 months (93-63 microV(2), P = 0.4). From equilibrium to emergence mean forehead spectral edge frequency increased in children aged 2-12 years (10.8-13.7 Hz, P = 0.01) but no change was found in children aged 6-24 months (12.7-12.7 Hz, P = 0.9) or 0-6 months (9.45-7.26 Hz, P = 0.08). Throughout emergence, infants demonstrated a discontinuous EEG pattern with intermittent bursts separated with low amplitude.
During anesthesia, the EEG in infants is fundamentally different from the EEG in older children. This study supports the need for specific infant-derived algorithms if EEG-derived anesthesia depth monitors are to be used in infants.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18095968/

Current methods are based on spontaneous EEG providing only indirect information on the reactivity of the brain. Measurement of auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) has been shown to have additional potential for evaluation of the level of consciousness. Unfortunately, compact and easy-to-use devices are not commercially available. In this study a portable battery-powered device for clinical auditory ERP measurements was designed, constructed and validated. The device consists of a five-channel data logger and a 16-bit stereo audio stimulator. The signals are digitized with a 22-bit sigma-delta analogue-to-digital converter and stored to a PC Card hard disk. Prior to the in vivo application, the device was validated with extensive technical tests. Importantly, the RMS noise amplitude of the EEG channels was found to be less than 1 mivroV and the delivered auditory stimulus intensity corresponded accurately the settings (mean difference 0.2+/-0.5 dB). In addition to technical tests the device was successfully validated in vivo. To summarize, a novel portable instrument for measurement of auditory event-related potentials in intensive care environment is introduced.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18068851/

Since the traditional methods of assessing DOA which involve monitoring the heart rate, pupil size, sweating etc, may vary from patient to patient depending on the type of surgery and the type of drug administered, modern methods based on electroencephalogram (EEG) are preferred. EEG being a nonlinear signal, it is appropriate to use nonlinear chaotic parameters to identify the anesthetic depth levels. This paper discusses an automated detection method of anesthetic depth levels based on EEG recordings using non-linear chaotic features and neural network classifiers. Three nonlinear parameters, namely, correlation dimension (CD), Lyapunov exponent (LE) and Hurst exponent (HE) are used as features and two neural network models, namely, multi-layer perceptron network (feed forward model) and Elman network (feedback model) are used for classification. The neural network models are trained and tested with single and multiple features derived from chaotic parameters and the performances are evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy. It is found from the experimental results that the Lyapunov exponent feature with Elman network yields an overall accuracy of 99% in detecting the anesthetic depth levels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18041276/

The objective of the present work was to study human electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep spindles during dexmedetomidine sedation and compare them with spindles during normal physiological sleep, to test the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine exerts its effects via normal sleep-promoting pathways.
EEG was continuously recorded from a bipolar frontopolar-laterofrontal derivation with Entropy Module (GE Healthcare) during light and deep dexmedetomidine sedation (target-controlled infusions set at 0.5 and 3.2 ng/ml) in 11 healthy subjects, and during physiological sleep in 10 healthy control subjects. Sleep spindles were visually scored and quantitatively analyzed for density, duration, amplitude (band-pass filtering) and frequency content (matching pursuit approach), and compared between the two groups.
In visual analysis, EEG activity during dexmedetomidine sedation was similar to physiological stage 2 (S2) sleep with slight to moderate amount of slow-wave activity and abundant sleep spindle activity. In quantitative EEG analyses, sleep spindles were similar during dexmedetomidine sedation and normal sleep. No statistically significant differences were found in spindle density, amplitude or frequency content, but the spindles during dexmedetomidine sedation had longer duration (mean 1.11 s, SD 0.14 s) than spindles in normal sleep (mean 0.88 s, SD 0.14 s; P=0.0014).
Analysis of sleep spindles shows that dexmedetomidine produces a state closely resembling physiological S2 sleep in humans, which gives further support to earlier experimental evidence for activation of normal non-rapid eye movement sleep-promoting pathways by this sedative agent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18005372/

The dimension of the anesthesia strange attractor can be thought of as a measure of the degrees of freedom or the ;complexity' of the dynamics at different hypnotic levels.

For the analysis, the patients were divided into subgroups of poor outcome (persistent vegetative state, N=4) and good outcome (regain of consciousness, N=16). WSE for each 5-sec segment of EEG was calculated and also the average of WSE for each hour. Also, similar results were calculated for EEG powers in the bands 16-32 Hz and 1-60 Hz to be used as references. The statistical analysis was made by comparing the medians of the distributions of average WSE of each hour between poor and good outcome groups. The median of WSE of poor outcome group was significantly lower than that of good outcome group. The reference indicators did not show significant differences between the groups.

Such a method might prevent currently used time consuming averaging procedures which require the state of spontaneous sleep, sedation, or narcosis of the newborns when using such systems in universal newborn hearing screening programs. In this study, we present an evaluation of new feature for such novelty detection schemes, namely the synchronization stability of auditory evoked brainstem activity. For this, large-scale correlates of the neural group synchronization at the brainstem for stimulation levels above the hearing threshold are detected as novel event. This novelty detection paradigm allows for the adaptive inclusion of individual measurement conditions using the spontaneous EEG. For the individual patient, at the challenging stimulation level of 30dB(HL) the synchronization stability allowed the discrimination of stimulated from the non-stimulated condition in a fraction of time of conventional devices.

Because of this, several depth of anesthesia monitors have been developed, and are in current use at the operating room (OR). These monitors convert the information supplied by the EEG or derived signals into a simple, easy to understand index. Nowadays, general anesthesia is controlled only by the clinician, which decides what is the best drug combination for the patient, regarding all information given by monitors and sensors in the OR. In this work, we collected data from two study groups with auditory evoked potentials (AEP) monitoring, and Entropy (SE) monitoring. A model was fitted to the signals and the Hill equation parameters adjusted, in both study groups. The objective was to predict hypnosis indices, regarding only the drugs administered to a patient, and capture the initial individual patient characteristics that might influence the drugs interaction in the human body. Hypnotic and analgesic drugs interact in different ways throughout the anaesthesia stages.

We show that slow and fast delta waves (0-2 Hz and 2-4 Hz respectively) and high frequency components of the EEG (8-20 Hz) are correlated with each other and there is a kind of phase locking between them that varies with depth of anesthesia. Our analyses show that maximum amplitudes of high frequency components of the EEG signal are appeared in different phases of slow and fast delta waves when the concentration of Desflurane and Propofol anesthetic agents varies in a patient. There are some slight differences in using slow and fast components of delta waves. For instance, when depth of anesthesia changes, biphasic responses of the EEG have more influences on results of the fast delta wave method. In addition, this method obtains more robust and less noisy results compared with the slow delta wave method. Since phase angle between fast EEG oscillations and delta waves indicates the status of information processing in the brain and it changes in various unconsciousness levels, it may improve the performance of other classic methods of determining depth of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18002200/

The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of burst suppression EEG during propofol anaesthesia using scalp electrodes and depth electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus. Specifically, we describe the electrical fields of the three EEG patterns we have previously described: the sharp wave, the burst and the spindle.
We recorded the EEG of three Parkinson patients during propofol anaesthesia from the scalp electrodes and the depth electrode implanted in the subthalamic nucleus for treating parkinsonism.
(1) The slow waves of bursts recorded from all surface electrodes on scalp or neck with depth electrode reference are positive and have the highest amplitude in frontal electrodes, suggesting synchronous generation in the whole cerebral cortex. (2) The sharp wave and spindles have the highest amplitude at vertex. They are opposite in polarity in vertex and depth electrodes when referred to the neck electrode, suggesting generation in the sensorimotor cortex.
Recording simultaneously EEG from the depth and scalp electrodes shows that bursts and their slow wave oscillations are synchronous in the whole cortex while spindles and sharp waves are produced by the sensorimotor cortex.

Generally, in mean-field models, some sigmoid-shape functions determine firing rates of neural populations according to their mean membrane potentials. In the enhanced model, the sigmoid function corresponding to excitatory population is redefined to be also a function of the slow ionic mechanism. This modification adapts the firing rate of neural populations to slow ionic activities of the brain. When an anesthetic drug is administered, the slow mechanism may induce neural cells to alternate between two levels of activity referred to as up and down states. Basically, the frequency of up-down switching is in the delta band (0-4 Hz) and this is the main reason behind high amplitude, low frequency fluctuations of EEG signals in anesthesia. Our analyses show that the enhanced model may have different working states driven by anesthetic drug concentration. The model is settled in the up state in the waking period, it may switch to up and down states in moderate anesthesia while in deep anesthesia it remains in the down state.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17995030/

This study evaluated a rational selection of EEG variables as measures of arousal during surgical anaesthesia in children.
Sixty children undergoing surgical anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil were enrolled. The performance of 33 single EEG variables and bispectral index (BIS) was assessed by simultaneous analysis of prediction probability (Pk) of Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Sedation Scores and their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Variables performing best in Pk and SNR analysis were selected as potential measures of arousal. Their performance was investigated in five age groups, 0-1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-8, and 8-13 yr.
Single EEG variables such as relative power from frequency bands 13-20 and 20-26 Hz, SEF95, and approximate entropy performed best with Pk>0.59 and SNR>5.50. The Pk and SNR of BIS were 0.71 and 15.76, respectively. Their performance was significantly better in children aged 1-13 yr than in 0-1 yr.
BIS may provide a measure of arousal during propofol anaesthesia in children, but its accuracy is less in infants younger than 12 months.

Existing EEG monitors use cortical activity as a proxy measure for consciousness. However the state of the cortex at any given moment does not accurately predict the state that it will enter in response to a noxious stimulus, and EEG monitors do not differentiate well between different levels of rousability. Also the literature reveals many instances where the EEG pattern is dissociated from conscious state (e.g. an awake-looking EEG, but an unresponsive patient; or a slow-wave EEG in an awake patient).

30 intubated, mechanically ventilated patients without primary neurological diagnoses or drug overdose receiving continuous sedation.
Monitoring of EEG and fEMG activity via forehead electrodes for up to 72h and assessments of conscious level using a modified Ramsay Sedation Scale.
475 trained observer assessments were made and compared with concurrent Entropy numbers. Median State (SE) and Response (RE) Entropy values decreased as Ramsay score increased, but wide variation occurred, especially in Ramsay 4-6 categories. Discrimination between different sedation scores [mean (SEM) P(K) value: RE 0.713 (0.019); SE 0.710 (0.019)] and between lighter (Ramsay 1-3) vs.deeper (Ramsay 4-6) sedation ranges was inadequate [P(K): RE 0.750 (0.025); SE 0.748 (0.025)]. fEMG power decreased with increasing Ramsay score but was often significant even at Ramsay 4-6 states. Frequent ""on-off"" effects occurred for both RE and SE, which were associated with fEMG activity. Values switched from low to high values even in deeply sedated patients. High Entropy values during deeper sedation were strongly associated with simultaneous high relative fEMG powers.
Entropy of the frontal EEG does not discriminate sedation state adequately for clinical use in ICU patients. Facial EMG is a major confounder in clinical sedation ranges.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17898996/

It is based on a visual EEG scoring system, which was developed by Loomis and modified by Kugler, to yield a visual expert classification (VEC) scheme for differentiation of six levels of sedation (A-F), which are subdivided into 16 substages. We designed the present study to test whether results of the automated classification of one-channel NCT input reflect those from VEC of five-channel EEG.
Twelve healthy male volunteers received propofol using two different infusion regimens in a randomized, crossover design with concomitant NCT monitoring and VEC. Scoring results of NCT were compared with those of VEC.
During the infusion period, score differences of more than three substages were observed in 14 of 24 (= 58%) propofol administrations (4%-7% of total data). Often, the NCT indicated lighter sedation than VEC, which revealed more delta activity from nonfrontal leads. During recovery, NCT reported deeper sedation than VEC in 6 of 24 (= 25%) propofol administrations. Discordant trends (periods of at least five subsequent epochs with monotonic, but opposite trends for both NCT and VEC) were noted in 9 of 24 propofol administrations (37%). Furthermore, NCT had several periods when no staging information was displayed, varying from a few seconds to 10 min.
As the algorithm of NCT is proprietary and not accessible to the public, reasons for the observed differences between NCT and VEC cannot be analyzed and explanations must remain speculative.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17898377/

The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that the intraoperative level of anaesthetic depth differs if decision-making is guided by Narcotrend monitoring or not.
Forty-eight patients undergoing elective surgery were randomized to receive a Narcotrend-controlled propofol/remifentanil anaesthetic regimen or standard clinical practice. In the EEG group, anaesthesia was adjusted to achieve a Narcotrend level of D2-E0, which is recommended for moderate to deep anaesthetic depth for surgery. EEG values were recorded continuously every 20 s in both groups. Depending on data distribution, group comparisons of the EEG parameters, propofol plasma concentration, and recovery characteristics were performed by analysis of variance for repeated measurements or non-parametric statistics.
About 62 (sd 29)% of the Narcotrend values were within the target level in the EEG group during maintenance of anaesthesia; this was true for 64 (26)% of the data in the non-EEG group. The variance of the Narcotrend data was significantly lower in the EEG group compared with the non-EEG group [median: 0.4 (range: 3.5) vs 0.6 (2.5); P = 0.048]. There was no difference in propofol or remifentanil dosage, propofol plasma concentrations, and time for extubation. Ten minutes after extubation, visual analogue scores for nausea indicated a lower incidence in the Narcotrend group [7 (15) vs 24 (34); P = 0.005].
Guidance of anaesthesia with the Narcotrend-monitor leads to fewer deviations from a defined target than clinical assessment of anaesthetic depth only. This results in lower scores of nausea in the immediate period after anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17704091/

Our aim has been to evaluate sedation of intubated surgical critically ill patients by means of the Ramsay sedation score, the Bispectral index and ENTROPY, and to analyse the correlation between these variables.
Sedation was evaluated every 15 min for a 1 h period in 50 non-paralysed postoperative critically ill, intubated patients, enrolled over a 6 month period. A 5 min steady-state period was allowed before each assessment. Both the Bispectral index and the Entropy parameters Response Entropy (RE) and State Entropy (SE), were collected before assessing the Ramsay scale.
Mean values for SE, RE and BIS were 53 +/- 27, 60 +/- 30, and 62 +/- 24 respectively. The median value for the Ramsay was 6 (range 1-6). Significant correlation was found between the four variables (SE-BIS: r = 0.79, p < 0.001; RE-BIS: r = 0.80, p < 0.001; SE-Ramsay: rho = -0.71, p < 0.001, RE-Ramsay: rho = -0.72, p < 0.001; BIS-Ramsay: rho = -0.78, p < 0.001; RE-SE: r = 0.98, p < 0.001).

E, Statistical, nonlinear, and soft matter physics",2007,"Steyn-Ross ML, Steyn-Ross DA, Wilson MT, Sleigh JW","One of the grand puzzles in neuroscience is establishing the link between cognition and the disparate patterns of spontaneous and task-induced brain activity that can be measured clinically using a wide range of detection modalities such as scalp electrodes and imaging tomography. High-level brain function is not a single-neuron property, yet emerges as a cooperative phenomenon of multiply-interacting populations of neurons. Therefore a fruitful modeling approach is to picture the cerebral cortex as a continuum characterized by parameters that have been averaged over a small volume of cortical tissue. Such mean-field cortical models have been used to investigate gross patterns of brain behavior such as anesthesia, the cycles of natural sleep, memory and erasure in slow-wave sleep, and epilepsy. There is persuasive and accumulating evidence that direct gap-junction connections between inhibitory neurons promote synchronous oscillatory behavior both locally and across distances of some centimeters, but, to date, continuum models have ignored gap-junction connectivity. In this paper we employ simple mean-field arguments to derive an expression for D2, the diffusive coupling strength arising from gap-junction connections between inhibitory neurons. Using recent neurophysiological measurements reported by Fukuda [J. Neurosci. 26, 3434 (2006)], we estimate an upper limit of D2 approximately 0.6cm2. We apply a linear stability analysis to a standard mean-field cortical model, augmented with gap-junction diffusion, and find this value for the diffusive coupling strength to be close to the critical value required to destabilize the homogeneous steady state. Computer simulations demonstrate that larger values of D2 cause the noise-driven model cortex to spontaneously crystalize into random mazelike Turing structures: centimeter-scale spatial patterns in which regions of high-firing activity are intermixed with regions of low-firing activity. These structures are consistent with the spatial variations in brain activity patterns detected with the BOLD (blood oxygen-level-dependent) signal detected with magnetic resonance imaging, and may provide a natural substrate for synchronous gamma-band rhythms observed across separated EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17677503/

Unconsciousness involved the cortical brain but suppression of movement in response to noxious stimuli was mediated through subcortical structures.
Twenty-five patients with Parkinson disease, previously implanted with a deep-brain stimulation electrode, were enrolled during the implantation of the definitive pulse generator. During induction of anesthesia with propofol (n = 13) or sevoflurane (n = 12) alone, cortical (EEG) and subcortical (ESCoG) electrogenesis were obtained, respectively, from a frontal montage (F3-C3) and through the deep-brain electrode (p0-p3). In EEG and ESCoG spectral analysis, spectral edge (90%) frequency, median power frequency, and nonlinear analysis dimensional activation calculations were determined.
Sevoflurane and propofol decreased EEG and ESCoG activity in a dose-related fashion. EEG values decreased dramatically at loss of consciousness, whereas there was little change in ESCoG values. Quantitative parameters derived from EEG but not from ESCoG were able to predict consciousness versus unconsciousness. Conversely, quantitative parameters derived from ESCoG but not from EEG were able to predict movement in response to laryngoscopy.
These data suggest that in humans, unconsciousness mainly involves the cortical brain, but that suppression of movement in response to noxious stimuli is mediated through the effect of anesthetic agents on subcortical structures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17667563/

Comparison of performance with the BIS and spectral entropy.,British journal of anaesthesia,2007,"Barnard JP, Bennett C, Voss LJ, Sleigh JW","Unlike the other physiological waveforms monitored in anaesthesia, the EEG lacks a regularly repeating pattern, implying that it would be very difficult for an anaesthetist to obtain any useful information from the raw EEG. There are, however, clear changes in the EEG caused by GABA-ergic anaesthetic agents. The anaesthetized EEG still looks like a random waveform, but clearly a different random waveform from that seen when conscious.
The aim of this study was to assess how 40 anaesthetists would perform at interpreting intra-operative EEGs compared with two processed EEG (pEEG) monitors, BIS and entropy, after a short educational presentation. Short segments of EEGs were used from the pre-induction phase, the intra-operative phase with adequate surgical anaesthesia, and the transition phase between these two states.
While anaesthetists' performance varied widely, most could reliably differentiate an anaesthetized from a conscious EEG. Further, both humans (41% wrong) and machines (30% wrong) made mistakes. Unlike the anaesthetists, the pEEG monitors did not make a major error (i.e. producing a number in the conscious range (>85) when analysing an anaesthetized EEG or the converse error).
A brief PowerPoint presentation enables anaesthetists to recognize the effects on the EEG of GABA-ergic anaesthetic agents. In the clinical context, it remains likely that the combination of a pEEG monitor that clearly presents the EEG and a clinician who has a good, basic understanding of, and a willingness to look at, the raw EEG will result in more accurate interpretation of the intra-operative EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17652076/

Most EEG-fMRI studies in epilepsy have been performed in adults. Childhood epilepsies, however, differ from those in adults due to interactions between epileptogenic and developmental processes. The purpose of this study was to investigate EEG-fMRI in children with lesional epilepsies.
Thirteen children with symptomatic epilepsy underwent a 20-min EEG-fMRI acquisition at 3 T under sedation-induced sleep. Statistical analysis was performed using the timing of spikes as events, modelled with hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) that peaked at 3, 5, 7, and 9 s after the spike.
Each spike type was analyzed separately, resulting in 25 studies. In 84% of the studies, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses were localized in the lesion or brain area presumably generating spikes. Activation (positive BOLD) corresponding with the lesion was seen in 20% and deactivation (negative BOLD) in 52% of the studies. In the area of spike generation, activation was found in 48% of studies and deactivation in 36%.
Despite the necessarily short recording times (20 min), good results could be obtained from the EEG-fMRI recordings, performed in sedated children using a high field scanner and individual HRFs. In contrast to studies in adults, deactivations in the lesion and the irritative zone were more common than activations. The impact of age, sleep, and sedation on the BOLD response might explain these findings, but future studies in children should not disregard the importance of deactivations in relation to the epileptogenic network.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17645544/

The purpose of this study was to evaluate autonomic effects of anesthesia in patients with brain tumors compared to neurosurgical controls.
Two groups were evaluated: group 1 = 10 neurosurgical patients undergoing spinal cord surgery, group 2 = 10 patients with intracranial tumors. After placement of electrocardiogram and Response Entropy electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes, 10 min baseline measures were made. Heart periods were transformed into a percentage index and heart rate entropy determined as a measure of variance of autonomic activity. Tone was evaluated as the balance between accelerator and inhibitory activity. Tone-entropy was measured during propofol anesthetic induction and the first 60 min of desflurane anesthesia before the start of surgery.
Blood pressure and heart rate were similar between the groups. Starting at awake levels, vagal heart tone was observed. Anesthesia decreased vagal dominance to near zero in both groups. Heart rate entropy and EEG activity decreased during anesthesia with no significant difference between the groups. Desflurane concentrations required to maintain anesthesia were significantly lower in patients in brain tumors.
Tone-entropy analysis of heart rate indicates anesthetic related depression of autonomic activity with no difference between groups. Normal titration of desflurane concentrations to maintain adequate blood pressure produced desflurane requirements that were lower in patients with brain tumors, while autonomic and EEG activity were similar.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17641979/

Melatonin, inducing natural sleep without the risks of sedation, has been successfully used to induce sleep prior to EEG investigations. 250 children (142 male, 108 female) with suspected hearing loss underwent ABR (auditory brainstem responses) tests in melatonin-induced sleep. Click-induced and notched-noise ABR tests were performed. Click tests were successfully performed in 216 of 249 children or 86.7% (123 male, 93 female), notched-noise tests in 115 of 155 children or 74.2%. Failure rates showed an age dependence increasing from 4% in children <1 year to 25%>3 years, but no gender difference. In conclusion, melatonin-induced sleep is a good alternative to sedation, especially in children younger than 3 years. This method is widely accepted by parents and permits earlier diagnosis of hearing impairment in a routine clinical setting. The number of children undergoing general anaesthesia for ABR investigation was reduced from over 60 per year in 2000-2002 to 12 in 2005, which means >80% less general anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17607596/

Long-term survival and stroke-free survival after CEA may guide decisions concerning this procedure for asymptomatic patients, but this outcome has only been considered in few reports outside the large randomized trial setting. This study analyzed long-term survival and stroke-free survival after CEA and the impact of risk factors in a consecutive series of asymptomatic patients, including those with medical comorbidities and particular anatomical features believed to increase the perioperative morbidity and mortality of CEA.
For over 10 years, data were prospectively collected for all patients who underwent CEA for asymptomatic severe carotid disease at our institution. All CEAs performed by the same surgeon involved eversion technique, with patients under deep general anesthesia and continuous perioperative electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring for selective shunting. All patients had neurological follow-up and duplex ultrasound at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. A complete follow-up (mean, 6.1 years; range, 0.1 to 10.6 years) was obtained in 348 patients (93%) with an overall 365 CEAs (93%). Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier life tables.
Among 374 patients undergoing 391 CEAs, there were no perioperative deaths or strokes. There were 17 (4.8%) late deaths, mainly cardiac-related (70%), and 2 (0.5%) non-fatal strokes. At 5 and 10 years, survival was 96.3% and 85.7%, and stroke-free survival was 95.6% and 84.8%, respectively. At multivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus (P = .002) and cardiac disease (P = .005) were independent predictors of a shorter long-term survival.
Eversion CEA proved safe and effective in a series of patients with asymptomatic severe carotid disease representing the typical population of daily clinical practice.

Epileptiform discharges were counted for each 15-minute epoch during the study. Two of the 5 patients had a discrete spike focus in each hemisphere. Thus, we analyzed the activity of 7 distinct foci. Epileptiform activity did not decrease in any individual focus during dexmedetomidine infusion. Although dexmedetomidine did not have a statistically significant effect on interictal epileptiform activity for the group as a whole, the activity of 4 foci increased during dexmedetomidine infusion.

It combines auditory evoked potentials and passive EEG parameters into a single index. This study aimed to assess the AAI-1.6 as a predictor of level of anesthesia in infants and children.
Four infants aged less than 1 year, and five older children aged between 2 and 11 years were enrolled. They all had uniform sevoflurane anesthesia for cardiac catheterization. The AAI-1.6 and bispectral index (BIS) were recorded after achieving equilibrium at 1.5%, 2% and 2.5% sevoflurane, and immediately prior to awakening. The prediction coefficient (Pk) for BIS and AAI-1.6 was calculated and compared within each age group.
The Pk for the AAI-1.6 was low in both 0-1 and 2-11 years age groups. In the 2-12 years group, the Pk for BIS was significantly higher than the Pk for the AAI-1.6 (Pk for BIS: 0.89, Pk for AAI-1.6: 0.53, P < 0.01).

Allopregnanolone decreased SEV more in women than in men, and increased subjective ratings of 'sedation'. The results in women on OC are similar to earlier results in women without OC. Subjective ratings of 'contentedness' decreased in men but increased in women. Serum levels of allopregnanolone were more highly increased in men compared to women.

Heart rate variability and frontal electromyography (EMG), which are related to subcortical functions, may be more closely related than surface electroencephalography (EEG) to movement responses to noxious stimulation.
Eighty-two patients scheduled for uterine dilatation and curettage were randomized to receive at the first intra-operative movement either a supplemental alfentanil bolus, 0.5 mg intravenously, or a supplemental propofol bolus, 0.7 mg/kg intravenously. The incidences of recurring movement during the procedure were compared between the two groups.

The incidences of recurring movement were 73% and 38% in the alfentanil and propofol groups, respectively [difference, 35%; 95% confidence interval, 9-56%; P= 0.014 between the groups). The Anemon index, heart rate, EMG and surface EEG variables displayed mainly reactive associations with movement responses.
During uterine curettage under propofol-alfentanil-nitrous oxide anaesthesia, a propofol bolus of 0.7 mg/kg was more effective in preventing the recurrence of movement responses than an alfentanil bolus of 0.5 mg.

We sought to establish the prevalence of prolonged cerebral seizures in a representative sample from routine clinical practice in Edinburgh and do so at the first treatment, when the risk is greatest.
Two-channel EEG monitoring was conducted at the first treatment in a new course given to 100 individual consecutive patients.
The titration had to be curtailed for anesthetic reasons in 2 patients, and no cerebral seizure was induced. Electroencephalogram measurement of seizure duration was practicable in only 95 of the remaining patients. Two cerebral seizures longer than 120 seconds were detected. One seizure ended spontaneously after 158 seconds and was associated with a generalized convulsion lasting 77 seconds. One was medically terminated after 180 seconds and was associated with a generalized convulsion lasting 122 seconds; this patient had an encephalopathy during the index illness.
The prevalence of prolonged seizures in our routine clinical practice was 1% to 2%, depending on the definition of prolonged cerebral seizure activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17435565/
17433920,Epidemiology and outcomes of status epilepticus in the elderly.,International review of neurobiology,2007,Towne AR,"Status epilepticus (SE) is a serious condition of prolonged or repetitive seizures. The annual incidence (86/100,000) of SE in the elderly who are aged 60 and greater is almost twice that of the general population and is even higher in those who are 70 years and older. Either acute or remote symptomatic stroke causes approximately 60% of SE seen in the elderly. SE is associated with a high mortality in the elderly (38%), with a rate approaching 50% in patients older than 80 years of age. Etiology is a strong determinant of mortality in the elderly: mortality approaches 100% in patients with anoxia and 30% in patients with either metabolic disorders, hemorrhages, tumors, or systemic infections. Mortality is almost three times higher in SE associated with acute ischemic stroke than in stroke alone, indicating synergistic effects. Duration of SE is also a factor in mortality. Treatment should be initiated for any convulsive seizure that lasts at least 10 min or is repetitive. An electroencephalogram (EEG) should be promptly obtained so that a diagnosis can be made without delay. Because older patients have a greater likelihood of nondiagnostic findings on routine EEGs, prolonged EEG recordings and inpatient video-EEG monitoring significantly increase the rate of establishing a definitive diagnosis. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus in the elderly is especially difficult to diagnose and should be evaluated with an EEG. Treatment of SE is complicated by altered pharmacokinetics in the elderly. Initial treatments, usually the administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine, have overall success rates of 55% for overt convulsive SE and 14.9% for subtle SE. For refractory SE, little is gained by using additional standard drugs, and general anesthesia with continuous EEG monitoring is recommended.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17433920/
17425814,Monitoring with EEG entropy decreases propofol requirement and maintains cardiovascular stability during induction of anaesthesia in elderly patients.,European journal of anaesthesiology,2007,"Riad W, Schreiber M, Saeed AB","Electroencephalographic entropy is used to measure the degree of brain hypnosis and anaesthesia depth. Two parameters are displayed in the monitor, state entropy (SE) and response entropy (RE). Ageing leads to reduction in liver mass as well as hepatic blood flow, which decreases clearance of propofol and increases the risk of cardiovascular adverse effects. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effect of electroencephalographic entropy on propofol requirement and haemodynamic parameters during induction of anaesthesia in elderly patients.
We studied 72 elderly patients. Standard monitoring was performed for all patients together with entropy monitor. Patients were allocated randomly either to the control group, which were given the recommended induction dose of propofol, or to the entropy group which was induced with propofol based on entropy reading where the end-point was SE 50 and SE-RE difference less than 10. Propofol induction doses and haemodynamic changes were recorded. Anaesthesia was maintained using sevoflurane and O2 air mixture.
After induction of anaesthesia, the systolic, diastolic, mean arterial pressure, RE and SE were significantly lower in the control group (P value < 0.05). Total dose of propofol and the dose kg-1 were significantly reduced by 37.1% and 31.8%, respectively, in the entropy group (P value < 0.01).
The use of electroencephalographic entropy during induction of anaesthesia in elderly patients reduces propofol requirements and maintains cardiovascular stability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17425814/

This was a randomized, prospective study of adults undergoing procedural sedation (PS) with propofol for fracture or dislocation reduction in the ED between July 2003 and March 2004. Patients were randomized to a target sedation level of moderate or deep, using American Society of Anesthesiologists' definitions. Doses, vital signs, nasal end tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)), pulse oximetry, and bispectral EEG analysis (BIS) scores were recorded. Respiratory depression was defined as a change in ETCO(2) >10, an oxygen saturation of <90% at any time, or an absent ETCO(2) waveform at any time. After the procedure, patients were asked if they perceived any pain or had any recall of the procedure. Physicians were asked to rate the difficulty of completing the reduction using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Respiratory depression rates were compared with chi-square tests, BIS and VAS scores were compared with t tests. Seventy-five patients were enrolled, 39 randomized to the target of moderate PS and 36 to the target of deep PS. No significant complications were noted. There were 25/36 (69%) of the patients assigned to the deep sedation target group who actually achieved a deep level of sedation and 21/39 (54%) of the patients assigned to the moderate sedation target group who actually achieved a moderate level of sedation (p = 0.40). Respiratory depression was seen in 19/39 (49%) patients with the moderate PS target and 18/36 (50%) with the deep PS target (p = 0.91). The mean minimum recorded BIS score was 67.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 62.2-73.3) for the moderate PS target group and 59.2 (95% CI 55.1-64.2) for the deep PS target group (p = 0.03). There were 12/39 (31%) in the moderate PS target group and 4/36 (11%) in the deep PS target group who reported pain with or recall of the procedure (p = 0.04). The mean physician VAS for procedural difficulty was 34.0 (95% CI 23.7-44.3) for the moderate PS group and 28.8 (95% CI 18.4-39.2) for the deep PS group (p = 0.46). In this study, the assignment of a pre-procedural target sedation level of moderate or deep PS did not influence the level of sedation achieved, the rate of respiratory depression, the occurrence of complications, the time to return of baseline mental status, or the success of the procedure. It does not seem that the assignment of a pre-procedural target sedation level is an effective means of changing the outcome of ED PS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17394986/

Spindle oscillations are known to be related to the sedative actions of the reticular thalamic nucleus with links to thalamocortical neurons. This study was designed to examine the effect of ketamine on the spindle oscillations to understand the simultaneous sedative effect and EEG activation that occurs with ketamine, by comparing the EEG in emergence.
Anesthesia was induced with propofol using a target-controlled infusion (TCI) system (3.5 microg/ml). Seventeen patients, scheduled for non-cranial surgery under general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia, were randomly divided into two groups: (i) anesthesia was maintained with TCI-propofol alone (n= 8) and (ii) anesthesia was maintained with TCI-propofol and intravenously administered ketamine (n= 9). The EEG was continuously monitored and EEG indices and power spectra were determined.
Propofol alone caused the alpha-peaks of the power spectra to occur at an average frequency of 10.4 +/- 0.9 Hz; the addition of ketamine shifted the peaks to higher frequencies of 15.1 +/- 1.4 Hz (P < 0.05). On the other hand, when the EEG was activated by discontinuation of propofol, the corresponding alpha-peaks disappeared.
Ketamine increased the frequencies of alpha-spindle waves induced by propofol, but did not block their formations. The phenomena have the possibility to underlie the cooperative effect between propofol and ketamine concerning sedation and anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17378787/

The cerebral state index (CSI) monitor will accept regular ECG electrodes with snap connectors. The purpose of this study was to determine if generic ECG electrodes could replace the more expensive proprietary EEG electrodes for the CSI monitor.
Two identical cerebral state monitors were used simultaneously during sevoflurane anaesthesia for knee arthroscopy in 14 ASA I-II patients. One monitor used proprietary (Danmeter) EEG electrodes and the other used ECG electrodes (3M Red Dot Diagnostic ECG Electrodes). Paired CSI values were recorded every other minute. Anaesthetic depth was titrated clinically. Sedation depth was scored according to the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAAS) scale.
The agreement between the two measures was found to be high, mean difference--0.23, and the overall repeatability mean bias was 6.6 and 153/163 pairs (94%) were located within the 95% limits of agreement. No major difference was noted in impedance, noise, or artifacts. A large overlap in CSI was noted for each level of the OAAS scale; patients with CSI values as low as 40-50 responded whereas patients not responding to surgical stimulation had CSI values as high as 75. The direct cost of disposables decreased from 4euro to 0.50euro per patient by using ordinary ECG electrodes.
Switching from proprietary EEG electrodes to ordinary generic ECG electrodes maintains the same accuracy at about a 10th of the cost when measuring CSI during day surgery with sevoflurane anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17371776/

This set of EEG parameters is validated by an artificial neural network.
The purpose of this study is to arrive at a set of EEG parameters that 'best' distinguish between awake and anaesthetized states of human patients for halothane anaesthesia.
A total of 21 EEG parameters were evaluated for 40 patients. Stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) pruned them to a set of five parameters. They were fed to a 5-3-1 artificial neural network (ANN) for classification into awake and anaesthetized state. To confirm the results, variance analysis was applied to the set of 21 parameters. Five parameters were finalized after validation by the ANN.
The classification accuracy of the ANN with SDA parameters was found to be 96%. With variance analysis parameters, it returned an accuracy of 100%.
The set of five EEG parameters - approximate entropy, average frequency, Lempel Ziv (LZ) complexity, delta power and beta power forms the best set to distinguish between awake and anaesthetized state of human patients.

This study explores the synchrony between multiple cortical surface sites as brain injury patients emerge from coma.
Scalp electrode EEG recordings were collected and analyzed from 13 traumatic brain injury patients during their stay in a neurosurgical intensive care unit. Neuronal synchrony was calculated between various electrode pairs during comatose and conscious periods defined by the GCS. Frequency bands from 1 to 30 Hz were evaluated in each patient.
As patients emerged from coma at GCS 3 to GCS scores > or =8, synchrony values from all electrode pairs revealed a global decrease in synchrony at higher GCS scores. No significant effects were detected relative to the amount of sedation given, but at higher GCS scores significantly increased neuronal synchrony was observed between occipital lobes and right parietal and temporal lobe sites. Synchrony was decreased between frontal-occipital, frontal-parietal, and parietal-occipital electrodes.
In frequencies from 1 to 30 Hz, synchrony between right parietal and temporal lobes, as well as bilateral occipital lobes, tends to be increased as patients emerge from comatose states. However, synchrony between most intrahemispheric cortical sites is decreased at higher GCS scores in most of the above frequency bands. Thus, brain injury patients demonstrate both increased and decreased cortical surface synchrony between different lobes during emergence from coma.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17350400/
17342965,Depth of anesthesia monitoring.,Anesthesiology clinics,2006,Bowdle TA,"Depth-of-anesthesia monitoring with EEG or EEG combined with mLAER is becoming widely used in anesthesia practice. Evidence shows that this monitoring improves outcome by reducing the incidence of intra-operative awareness while reducing the average amount of anesthesia that is administered, resulting in faster wake-up and recovery, and perhaps reduced nausea and vomiting. As with any monitoring device, there are limitations in the use of the monitors and the anesthesiologist must be able to interpret the data accordingly. The limitations include the following. The currently available monitoring algorithms do not account for all anesthetic drugs, including ketamine, nitrous oxide and halothane. EMG and other high-frequency electrical artifacts are common and interfere with EEG interpretation. Data processing time produces a lag in the computation of the depth-of-anesthesia monitoring index. Frequently the EEG effects of anesthetic drugs are not good predictors of movement in response to a surgical stimulus because the main site of action for anesthetic drugs to prevent movement is the spinal cord. The use of depth-of-anesthesia monitoring in children is not as well understood as in adults. Several monitoring devices are commercially available. The BIS monitor is the most thoroughly studied and most widely used, but the amount of information about other monitors is growing. In the future, depth-of-anesthesia monitoring will probably help in further refining and better understanding the process of administering anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17342965/

However, evidences also suggest that BBB failure may be an etiological factor contributing to the development of seizures.
We monitored the onset of seizures in patients undergoing osmotic disruption of BBB (BBBD) followed by intraarterial chemotherapy (IAC) to treat primary brain lymphomas. Procedures were performed under barbiturate anesthesia. The effect of osmotic BBBD was also evaluated in naive pigs.
Focal motor seizures occurred immediately after BBBD in 25% of procedures and originated contralateral to the hemisphere of BBBD. No seizures were observed when BBB was not breached and only IAC was administered. The only predictors of seizures were positive indices of BBBD, namely elevation of serum S100beta levels and computed tomography (CT) scans. In a porcine model of BBBD, identical procedures generated an identical result, and sudden behavioral and electrographic (EEG) seizures correlated with successful BBB disruption. The contribution of tumor or chemotherapy to acute seizures was therefore excluded.
This is the first study to correlate extent of acute BBB openings and development of seizures in humans and in a large animal model of BBB opening. Acute vascular failure is sufficient to cause seizures in the absence of CNS pathologies or chemotherapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17319915/

Thirty-three patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy under propofol TIVA were prospectively and randomly allocated to receive either remifentanil (bolus of 1.0 microg/kg, followed by continuous infusion from 0.25 to 0.05 microg/kg/min) [n = 18] or alfentanil (bolus of 10 microg/kg, followed by continuous infusion from 2.0 to 0.5 microg/kg/min) [n = 15]. EEG activity was monitored to achieve the desired depth of anaesthesia, and intravenous propofol was titrated to keep the SFx at 70-80%. The remifentanil and alfentanil groups were compared in relation to the plasma propofol concentration required for an adequate level of hypnosis during maintenance of anaesthesia, Pearson correlation coefficient for the relationship between the plasma propofol concentration and SFx values, recovery parameters, and recall of events during anaesthesia.
The study groups were comparable with regard to demographic characteristics, type and duration of surgery, and time to resumption of spontaneous ventilation. No evidence of explicit recall was noted. The mean plasma propofol concentration required for an adequate level of hypnosis during maintenance of anaesthesia was significantly higher in the alfentanil group (3.20 microg/mL) compared with the remifentanil group (2.17 microg/L) [p < 0.05]. In both groups, the Pearson correlation coefficient test showed a linear correlation between SFx values and propofol concentration in the studied propofol concentration range. The mean time to orientation for name and place was significantly shorter (p < 0.05), the mean propofol concentration at orientation for name and place and at the resumption of spontaneous ventilation timepoints was significantly lower (both p < 0.01), and the mean SFx value at resumption of spontaneous ventilation timepoint was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the remifentanil group.
As SFx is linearly related to plasma propofol concentration, this index may be used to measure anaesthetic effect during propofol anaesthesia. The results of this clinical trial are consistent with a previous computer-simulated opioid-propofol model with regard to intraoperative and recovery variables, although the recovery occurred at different propofol concentration and SFx values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17284097/

Continuous EEG and SP monitoring was measured prospectively in 314 consecutive patients undergoing CEA between April 1, 2003, and July 30, 2006, under CBA. Indications for CEA were asymptomatic 70% to 99% internal carotid artery stenosis in 242 (77.1%), transient ischemic attacks (including transient monocular blindness) in 45 (14.3%), and prior stroke in 27 (8.6%). Mean common carotid artery pressure before clamping, mean SP after carotid clamping, and intraarterial pressure were continuously monitored in all patients. An indwelling shunt was placed when neurologic events (contralateral motor weakness, aphasia, loss of consciousness, or seizures) occurred, regardless of SP or EEG changes.
Shunt placement was necessary because of neurologic changes in 10% (32/314) of all CEAs performed under CBA. Only 3 patients (1.4%) of 216 required shunt placement if SP was 50 mm Hg or more, vs 29 (29.6%) of 98 if SP was less than 50 mm Hg (P < .00001; sensitivity, 29.8%; specificity, 98.6%). In patients with SP of 40 mm Hg or more, 7 (2.6%) of 270 required shunt placement, vs 25 (56.8%) of 44 if SP was less than 40 mm Hg (P < .00001; sensitivity, 56.8%; specificity, 97.4%). Ischemic EEG changes were observed in 19 (59.4%) of 32 patients (false-negative rate, 40.6%) requiring shunt placement under CBA. Three patients had false-positive EEG results and did not require shunt placement (false-positive rate, 1.0%). The perioperative stroke/death rate was 4 (1.2%) in 314.

A direct comparison of the processed EEG variables Bispectral Index (BIS, version 3.4) and Narcotrend Index (NI, version 2.0AF) was to be achieved by simultaneous recording. The ability of these parameters to differentiate between various clinical states was evaluated by using the prediction probability (P(k)). Age-related effects on the BIS and NI were analyzed by dividing the children into three age groups: 0-6, 7-18 and 19-60 months.
The preanesthesia, conscious children were differentiated from anesthetized patients by the BIS and NI with no overlap (P(k) = 1.0). In the awake period the BIS was superior to the NI (P(k) to differentiate 'end of anesthesia' from 'awakening' was 0.97 vs 0.73 respectively; P = 0.002). Patients aged 7-18 months showed higher BIS and NI values in the course of anesthesia than the younger and older children (P = 0.001). On awakening, children aged 0-6 months showed the lowest mean BIS (n.s.) and NI (P = 0.006) values.

We performed a teletherapeutic propofol infusion during total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol in 11 patients undergoing general surgery. The teletherapeutic system consisted of a computer at the patient site in Munich and a computer at the control site in Erlangen, which were connected via the internet through a virtual private network. The patient's EEG signal was sent to the control site computer, where the median frequency (MEF) of the EEG power spectrum was calculated. The propofol infusion, determined by a model-based adaptive feedback algorithm to maintain a MEF of 1.5 to 2 Hz, was sent to the patient site computer connected to the infusion pump. The quality of the control was assessed by the performance error defined as the percentage deviation of the measured MEF from the set point and the necessity of interventions by the anaesthetist at the patient site.
During closed-loop administration of propofol [83 (52) min] the median performance error of the system was - 4.6 (4.4)% and the median absolute performance error was 18.8 (5.7)%. From a total number of 10 905 transmitted EEG epochs, there were five epochs with transmission errors, without further consequences for drug control.

The study involved a pilot group of 10 patients undergoing routine carotid endarterectomy with shunt insertion under total intravenous anesthesia, and a study group of 26 additional patients. In all patients, rates of propofol and remifentanil providing a steady-state level of hypnosis (BIS: 40-60) were maintained constant throughout a recording period ranging from 3 minutes before CXC to shunt insertion. BIS was recorded throughout this period and the internal carotid backflow observed at the time of shunt insertion was graded as good, moderate, or poor. In addition, A-Line Autoregressive Index (AAI) and processed electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters were recorded in patients of the study group. All parameters were averaged over 1 minute before CXC, at CXC, 1, 2, and 3 minutes after CXC, and at shunt insertion. Statistical analysis was performed using chi2, Friedman, and Spearman correlation tests. For technical reasons, reliable AAI, BIS monitor-derived, and other processed EEG data were obtained in 24, 25, and 18 patients of the study group, respectively. During the first 3 minutes after CXC, BIS increased over 60 [68.8 (6.1)] in 47%, decreased below 40 [34.9 (4.4)] in 25%, and remained in the 40 to 60 range in 28% of all recruited patients. A BIS increase was more frequently observed in patients with moderate or poor than in those with good internal carotid backflow (78, 67, and 29%, respectively). It was significantly correlated to an increase in AAI and EEG amplitude, a decrease in EEG suppression ratio, and a shorter time between induction of anesthesia and CXC. A BIS decrease was significantly correlated to an increase in suppression ratio and a longer time between induction and CXC. In conclusion, during CXC under a constant level of intravenous anesthesia, BIS may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged. The paradoxical BIS increase could be related to borderline ischemia, a change in brain anesthetic agent concentration, or a change in the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance associated with a CXC-elicited painful stimulation. Caution should be used when interpreting BIS value during CXC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17198101/

Anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol and remifentanil. Before incision, the propofol concentration was set to maintain BIS < 60. From incision to emergence, the anesthesiologist was denied access to BIS or Finapres. Anesthesia adjustment was titrated at the discretion of the anesthesiologist according to conventional signs only: brachial BP, EKG, eyelash reflex, movement. Occurrences of movement and eye signs (divergence of eyeballs, tears, corneal reflex, eyelash reflex) were observed. The CARDEAN algorithm was written retrospectively and tested vs. BIS.
11 movements occurred in 8 patients. CARDEAN > 60 predicted movement in 30% of the cases, 15 to 274 s before movement (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 95%; relative operating curve ROC = 0.98; prediction probability pk = 0.98). BIS > 60 predicted movement in 19% of cases (sensitivity: 64%; specificity: 94%, ROC: 0.85, pk: 0.85).
Retrospectively, a cardiovascular index predicted unexpected intraoperative movements. Prospective validation is needed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17186401/

This receptor may provide a novel target in the field of anesthesia.
We examined the hypnotic, electroencephalographic (EEG), and antinociceptive effects of two IV administered nonpeptide ORL1 agonists, (Ro 65-6570 and Org 26383), using LRR in mice and rats, percent EEG burst suppression in rats, and formalin paw test in mice.
In mice, Ro 65-6570 and Org 26383 produced LRR (hypnotic dose 0.6 and 3.7 micromol/kg for Ro 65-6570 and Org 26383, respectively). Naloxone had no significant effect on sleep times produced by both compounds. In rats, Ro 65-6570 (0.6-2.4 micromol/kg) and Org 26383 (4-8 micromol/kg) produced LRR and burst suppression activity in the EEG. Both sleep times and burst suppression activity were significantly reduced with a selective ORL1 antagonist. In mice, dose-dependent inhibition of formalin-induced nociceptive behaviors occurred (Phase 1 ED50 0.4 and 1.8 micromol/kg and Phase 2 ED50 0.4 and 4.2 micromol/kg for Ro 65-6570 and Org 26383, respectively).
These results show that Ro 65-6570 and Org 26383 (probably via the ORL1 receptor) behave as IV hypnotics and analgesics in mice and rats, and that the hypnotic and antinociceptive doses are similar.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17179266/

Most of these monitors calculate a numerical index reflecting the hypnotic component of anesthesia. Most of the underlying algorithms are proprietary. Therefore, a quality check or comparison of different indices is very complex.
Because there is limited information about the algorithms used for index calculation of the different monitors, a reliable comparison or test of the monitors is possible only if the same set of EEG data are presented to each monitor.
Parallel EEG monitoring during surgery is limited to two or three monitors because the space for electrode placement on the head is limited. This problem can be solved by using the EEG player to play back recorded EEG data to different monitors.
The output of the player corresponds to the original EEG signal. A comparison of different indices based on identical EEGs is therefore possible. The index reproducibility can also be checked, if the same signal is presented to different monitors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17179258/

The influence of anesthetic drugs on seizure ""adequacy"" or on treatment success has not been systematically investigated.
A bispectral EEG index score (BIS) was used to identify the depth of anesthesia during ECT. Our study included 22 major depressive episode (MDE) patients expanding to 219 ECTs (05/05-01/06) with no limitations of concurrent medication.
Fourteen out of the 22 patients showed full remission. Individual number of ECT sessions needed to reach full remission correlated negatively with mean pre-ECT BIS values (p=0.001). Additionally, using a repeated measurement regression analysis significant correlations were found for pre-ECT BIS versus motor response time, seizure concordance, ictal coherence and peak heart rate.
The results of our study suggest BIS-levels as a predictor of faster ECT response. Controlling BIS-levels before stimulation may have an additional effect on treatment success.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17124640/

This review discusses the basic principles behind these devices. The foundations of anesthesia monitoring rest on the observations of Guedel with ether that the depth of anesthesia relates to the cortical, brainstem and spinal effects of the anesthetic agents. Anesthesiologists strive to have a patient who is immobile, is unconscious, is hemodynamically stable and who has no intraoperative awareness or recall. These anesthetic management principles apply today, despite the absence of ether from the available anesthetic medications. The use of the EEG as a supplement to the usual monitoring techniques rests on the observation that anesthetic medications all alter the synaptic function which produces the EEG. Frontal EEG can be viewed as a surrogate for the drug effects on the entire central nervous system (CNS). Using mathematical processing techniques, commercial EEG devices create an index usually between 0 and 100 to characterize this drug effect. Critical aspects of memory formation occur in the frontal lobes making EEG monitoring in this area a possible method to assess risk of recall. Integration of processed EEG monitoring into anesthetic management is evolving and its ability to characterize all of the anesthetic effects on the CNS (in particular awareness and recall) and improve decision making is under study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17103250/

Maintaining an optimal level of sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU) is difficult because of a lack of appropriate monitoring methods to guide drug dosing. Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, has recently been introduced for the sedation of ICU patients. This study investigated the utility of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based spectral entropy monitoring (with M-ENTROPY, GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) for the assessment of dexmedetomidine-induced sedation.
Eleven healthy, non-smoking men, aged 23.9 +/- 2.5 years (mean +/- standard deviation), were recruited. Spectral entropy was recorded before and during low (0.5 ng/ml) and high (5 ng/ml) plasma concentrations of dexmedetomidine. At the end of the infusion, subjects were awakened by verbal command and light shaking.
Spectral entropy decreased from 84 +/- 5 to 66 +/- 16 (P= 0.029) during low dexmedetomidine levels and from 84 +/- 5 to 20 +/- 12 (P < 0.001) during high dexmedetomidine levels. Transitions during loss and regaining of consciousness were analysed separately. Entropy decreased from 76 +/- 8 before to 43 +/- 10 (P < 0.001) after loss of consciousness, and increased from 14 +/- 4 to 63 +/- 13 (P < 0.001) on regaining of consciousness. These changes were consistent across all subjects. Prediction probability and sensitivity values indicated a high predictive performance of the method.

Electrophysiologic monitoring may offer an approach to solving this problem. Since electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to different sedation regimens vary, we assessed electrophysiologic responses to two sedative drug regimens in 10 healthy volunteers. Dexmedetomidine/remifentanil (dex/remi group) and midazolam/remifentanil (mida/remi group) were infused 7 days apart. Each combination of medications was given at stepwise intervals to reach Ramsay scores (RS) 2, 3, and 4. Resting EEG, bispectral index (BIS), and the N100 amplitudes of long-latency auditory-evoked potentials (ERP) were recorded at each level of sedation. During dex/remi, resting EEG was characterized by a recurrent high-power low-frequency pattern which became more pronounced at deeper levels of sedation. BIS Index decreased uniformly in only the dex/remi group (from 94 +/- 3 at baseline to 58 +/- 14 at RS 4) compared to the mida/remi group (from 94 +/- 2 to 76 +/- 10; P = 0.029 between groups). The ERP amplitudes decreased from 5.3 +/- 1.3 at baseline to 0.4 +/- 1.1 at RS 4 (P = 0.003) in only the mida/remi group. We conclude that ERPs in volunteers sedated with dex/remi, in contrast to mida/remi, indicate a cortical response to acoustic stimuli, even when sedation reaches deeper levels. Consequently, ERP can monitor sedation with midazolam but not with dexmedetomidine. The reverse is true for BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17056949/

We prospectively assessed the occurrence of seizure-like phenomena and the effects of intravenous propofol on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in 25 children with epilepsy (mean (SD) age: 101 (49) months) and 25 children with learning difficulties (mean (SD) age: 52 (40) months) undergoing elective sedation for MRI studies of the brain. No child demonstrated seizure-like phenomena of epileptic origin during and after propofol sedation. Immediately after stopping propofol, characteristic EEG changes in the epilepsy group consisted of increased beta wave activity (23/25 children), and suppression of pre-existing theta rhythms (11/16 children). In addition, 16 of 18 children with epilepsy and documented EEG seizure activity demonstrated suppression of spike-wave patterns after propofol sedation. In all 25 children with learning difficulties an increase in beta wave activity was seen. Suppression of theta rhythms occurred in 11 of 12 children at the end of the MRI study. In no child of either group was a primary occurrence or an increase in spike-wave patterns seen following propofol administration. The occurrence of beta wave activity (children with learning difficulties and epilepsy group) and suppression of spike-wave patterns (epilepsy group) were transient, and disappeared after 4 h. This study demonstrates characteristic, time-dependent EEG patterns induced by propofol in children with epilepsy and learning difficulties. Our data support the concept of propofol being a sedative-hypnotic agent with anticonvulsant properties as shown by depression of spike-wave patterns in children with epilepsy and by the absence of seizure-like phenomena of epileptic origin.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17042840/

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, the electroencephalographic (EEG) and subjective response to a sub-psychotomimetic intravenous dose of the NMDA antagonist ketamine was examined in 20 regular smokers and 20 non-smokers pretreated with placebo or nicotine gum. Although nicotine increased EEG arousal, ketamine produced electrocerebral signs of brain activation (decreased slow wave power) and sedation (decreased fast wave power and frequency), which were not affected by nicotine pretreatment and were evident only in non-smokers. Ketamine increased a number of self-report indices of subjective arousal, some of which were attenuated and potentiated by nicotine in smokers and non-smokers, respectively. These findings suggest that long-term (evidenced by smoker vs. non-smoker comparisons) and short-term (acute) nicotine exposure may alter NMDA receptor-mediated arousal and mood systems in a way that promotes nicotine dependence in smokers, and addresses neurobiological deficiencies in smokers with schizophrenia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17023037/

On the basis of the r scale, the unresponsiveness to the verbal command (LVC) is forecasted. EEG recordings are taken from a 16-patient study population undergoing propofol anesthetic induction. EEG was filtered into consecutive 4-Hz passbands up to 28 Hz. Of these time-series, the amplitude envelopes were extracted and used as input features to the first and the second-order polynomial multiple linear regression models. The values r epsilon [0.4, 1] were predicted with the R2 value of 0.775 with a cross validation. The LVC times were forecasted with the median error of 5%-7% or equivalently 10-13 s. In contrast, using the median of the measured LVC times of the training population as a forecast, the corresponding error was 12% or 26 s. The results suggest an acceptable correlation between the r scale and the EEG spectrum in the studied range. Moreover, the r values of an individual can be predicted using a population model.

Previous studies investigated the variables from spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG), acoustic (AEP), or somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). But, by monitoring them separately, the available information from simultaneous gathering could be missed. We investigated whether the combination of simultaneous information from EEG, AEP, and SSEP shows a more discriminant power to differentiate between anesthesia states than from information derived from each measurement alone. Therefore, we assessed changes of 30 EEG, 21 SSEP, and 29 AEP variables recorded from 59 patients during four clinical states of general anesthesia: ""awake,"" ""light anesthesia,"" ""surgical anesthesia,"" and ""deep surgical anesthesia."" The single and combined discriminant powers of EEG, AEP, and SSEP variables as predictors of these states were investigated by discriminant analysis. EEG variables showed a higher discriminant power than AEP or SSEP variables: 85%, 46%, and 32% correctly classified cases, respectively. The frequency of correctly classified cases increased to 90% and 91% with information from EEG + AEP and EEG + AEP + SSEP, respectively. Thus, future anesthesia monitoring should consider combined information simultaneously distributed on different electrophysiological measurements, rather than single variables or their combination from EEG or AEP or SSEP.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17000800/

In the present study we evaluated the relationship between EEG bicoherence and sevoflurane concentration. Sixteen ASA physical status I-II patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were enrolled in the study. Anesthesia was induced with 5% sevoflurane and maintained with sevoflurane and oxygen (50%). Just before surgery, IV fentanyl (2 microg/kg) was given and then continuously infused (2 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)). Using software we developed, EEG bicoherence, BIS, and 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) were recorded at end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations of 0.5%, 0.8%, 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.3%. Under light anesthesia, EEG bicoherence values were low. With increasing sevoflurane concentrations, 2 peaks of bicoherence emerged along the diagonal line (f1 = f2). Both the first (at around 4 Hz) and second (at around 10 Hz) grew higher (37.7% +/- 7.5% and 35.1% +/- 9.0%, respectively) as the sevoflurane concentration increased to 1.4%. However, the first peak leveled off whereas the second tended to decrease slightly with further increases in sevoflurane concentration. The BIS value decreased as the sevoflurane concentration increased and leveled off at 1.4% and higher concentrations of sevoflurane. The SEF 95 also decreased as the sevoflurane concentration increased up to 2.3%. Thus the distribution pattern of the two bicoherence peaks is likely to be better than BIS of the anesthetic effect of sevoflurane during surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16931674/

Successful epilepsy surgery depends on unambiguous focus identification and requires a comprehensive presurgical workup, including several neuroimaging techniques [magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)]. These may be difficult to apply in younger or developmentally delayed children or both, requiring sedation, and hence, a significant workforce. Modern electric source imaging (ESI) provides accurate epileptic source-localization information in most patients, with minimal patient discomfort or need for cooperation. The purpose of the present study was to determine the usefulness of ESI in pediatric EEG recordings performed with routine electrode arrays.
Preoperative EEGs recorded from 19 to 29 scalp electrodes were reviewed, and interictal epileptiform activity was analyzed by using a linear source-imaging procedure (depth-weighted minimum norm) in combination with statistical parametric mapping.
In 27 (90%) of 30 patients, the ESI correctly localized the epileptogenic region. These numbers compare favorably with the results from other imaging techniques in the same patients (PET, 82%; ictal SPECT, 70%). In extratemporal epilepsy, ESI was correct in all cases, and in temporal lobe epilepsy, in 10 of 13 cases. In two temporal lobe patients showing less-accurate ESI results, 128-electrode data could be analyzed, and in both cases, the 128-electrode ESI was correct.
ESI with standard clinical EEG recordings provides excellent localizing information in pediatric patients, in particular in extratemporal lobe epilepsy. The lower yield in temporal lobe epilepsy seems to be due to undersampling of basal temporal areas with routine scalp recordings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16822244/

We compared Response Entropy (RE) and BIS during anesthesia for laparoscopic gastric banding with RE targeted to 45.
Forty patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric banding were randomly assigned to receive either fentanyl or dexmedetomidine infusion, with desflurane concentration adjusted to maintain RE at 45. During anesthesia the average RE and BIS was determined in each patient and the RE-BIS difference plotted as a function of RE every 10 seconds. Fifteen of 40 patients showed activation of RE above 60 during surgery. In these patients RE, BIS and the electromyogram (EMG) were evaluated for the period 10 minutes before and including the peak change in RE.
In fentanyl and dexmedetomidine treated patients the average RE was 44-47 with no statistical difference between anesthesia groups or between RE and BIS. In each patient there was a linear relationship between the RE-BIS difference and RE during anesthesia. RE and BIS were similar at a level of 41-44 and RE showed a greater range at higher and lower values compared to BIS. When RE activation was identified during surgery in 15 patients, it was associated with an increase in BIS and EMG.
Within the range of 41-44, RE and BIS are equal but the gain of RE is 0.5 greater than BIS with deeper or lighter anesthesia. This is not likely due to increased smoothing with BIS. Identifying periods of RE activation show that BIS, EMG and RE increase together.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16819583/

These EEG data were compared with EEG recordings from 6 matching subjects anesthetized with propofol.
The entropy values decreased from the baseline SE 85 (3) and RE 96 (3) to SE 55 (18) and RE 72 (17) during S-ketamine anesthesia but both inter- and intra-individual variation of entropy indices was wide and their specificity to indicate unconsciousness was poor. Propofol induced more pronounced increase in delta power (P<0.02) than S-ketamine, whereas anesthetic S-ketamine induced more high frequency EEG activity in the gamma band (P<0.001). Relative power of 20-70 Hz EEG activity was associated with high SE (P=0.02) and RE (P=0.03) values during S-ketamine anesthesia.

Levels of sedation were assessed using the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (MOAAS). EEG-measurements were performed during wakefulness, deep propofol sedation (MOAAS 2-3, mean BIS=68), and a recovery period. Between deep sedation and recovery period, the infusion rate of propofol was increased to achieve unconsciousness (MOAAS 0-1, mean BIS=35); EEG measurements of recovery period were performed after subjects regained consciousness.
During deep sedation, the physical MMN was markedly reduced, but still significant. No ERAN was observed in this level. A clear P3a was elicited during deep sedation by those deviants, which were task-relevant during the awake state. As soon as subjects regained consciousness during the recovery period, a normal MMN was elicited. By contrast, the P3a was absent in the recovery period, and the P3b was markedly reduced.
Results indicate that the auditory sensory memory (as indexed by the physical MMN) is still active, although strongly reduced, during deep sedation (MOAAS 2-3). The presence of the P3a indicates that attention-related processes are still operating during this level. Processes of syntactic analysis appear to be abolished during deep sedation. After propofol-induced anesthesia, the auditory sensory memory appears to operate normal as soon as subjects regain consciousness, whereas the attention-related processes indexed by P3a and P3b are markedly impaired.
Results inform about effects of sedative drugs on auditory and attention-related mechanisms.

Recently, devices that estimate depth of consciousness have been introduced in an attempt to better titrate anesthesia, however the effect of N(2)O on these monitors is unclear.
General anesthesia was induced and titrated to maintain normal blood pressure and pulse in healthy adults. Data were collected in three 10 minute intervals (Sevo, Sevo + N(2)O, Sevo). In Phase A, sevoflurane concentration was held constant during the N(2)O trial in 60 subjects monitored with either BIS, PSI, or Entropy. In Phase B, sevoflurane concentration was reduced as N(2)O was added, maintaining a constant overall ""MAC"" in 20 subjects monitored concurrently with BIS and Entropy. Sample size for both phases was designed to detect a 10 unit change in measure of processed EEG with alpha = .05 and statistical power = .80.
In Phase A, supplementing sevoflurane with > 65% N(2)O increased MAC from 1.3 +/- 0.05 to 2.2 +/- 0.10, but did not significantly alter BIS nor PSI (p-value for differential MAC is < 0.05). Entropy, however, dropped significantly, with a change in state entropy (SE) from 31.1 +/- 7.3 to 18.9 +/- 3.7 and a corresponding rise when N(2)O was discontinued.

Dose of propofol, quality of burst suppression EEG, hemodynamics and the course of intensive care were recorded. Clinical and electrophysiological seizures terminated quickly, but maintaining burst suppression EEG pattern required incremental doses of propofol.

16779619,A depth of anaesthesia index from linear regression of EEG parameters.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2006,"Kumar A, Anand S","The field of Anaesthesia has recently witnessed numerous advances both in the drug administration and monitoring of anaesthetic state. This development has further boosted the efforts and interest of researchers in the automation of clinical Anaesthesia. The success in this direction is possible only when assessment of the depth of hypnotic component of anaesthesia is achieved accurately. This paper describes a technique to arrive at a reliable Depth of Hypnosis (DoH) index using electroencephalographic (EEG) parameters.
EEG data from nine patients was recorded and processed to obtain a total of 21 EEG parameters. They were reduced to a set of best five parameters after applying graphical variance analysis which evaluates their power to discriminate between awake and unresponsive states. These five parameters were normalized with respect to awake state and used in a first order equation to give DoH index.
The value of computed DoH index varied from 0.37 to 0.58 for different patients during anesthetized state (awake value 1). For a single patient, the maximum variation in the index was observed as +/- 5% for different epochs at constant dose.
A combination of irregularity of EEG waveform in time-domain and band powers in frequency domain best describes the difference between awake and anesthetized states. To characterize these states, a set of optimum EEG parameters exists. These parameters must be normalized to reduce interpatient variability. The calculated graded index may be used to assist the anaesthetist in the operating theatre.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16779619/

The present study describes our experiences from implying continuous EEG monitoring as a routine method. We also present EEG patterns observed on patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Seventy TBI patients requiring neurointensive care were included. Digital EEG was recorded continuously. Five minutes every hour were analysed off-line.
Twenty-three patients (33%) developed seizures, 74+/-47 h after trauma. The seizures were brief, responding to phenytoin, or persistent, requiring propofol or barbiturate sedation. Six out of eight patients with persistent seizures had intracerebral contusions. Eighteen patients (26%) displayed focal high frequency activity that proceeded to seizures in eight cases. Twelve patients (17%) developed recurrent paroxysmal delta activity. The patients in the seizure group were significantly older (62+/-12 vs. 28+/-17 years) and more often exposed to low energy trauma (87% vs 22%) compared to the paroxysmal delta pattern group.
TBI implies high risk for development of epileptiform activity, with a time lag between trauma and seizure onset. TBI patients also displayed other EEG pattern that should be investigated further in order to obtain a better understanding of posttraumatic mechanisms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16774627/

The pleomorphic EEG patterns reflect this wide variety of clinical types. The different electroclinical types of status epilepticus share EEG characteristics including rhythmic activity, epileptiform discharges, and often a waxing and waning evolution. Gray zones of interpretation exist in the form of runs of epileptiform periodic discharges, typically of lower frequency, and lesser temporal variability. In diagnosing SE, clinical correlation and response to parenteral anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are of particular importance. Accurate diagnosis of electroclinical SE type is essential, because it determines prognosis and dictates the intensity of therapeutic management. Some patients with benign forms of SE may benefit from nonparenteral treatment, and be followed up clinically and by spot EEGs.

16749571,The bispectral index system in pediatrics--is it related to the end-tidal concentration of inhalation anesthetics?,Middle East journal of anaesthesiology,2006,Samarkandi AH,"BACKGROUND AND GOAL OF STUDY: Bispectral Index (BIS) has been used in adults to measure depth of anesthesia using various protocols. Though less investigated in children, there is growing evidence that bispectral index seems adequately calibrated for monitoring the depth of isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia in pediatric patients. A range of BIS scores (40-60) has been seen to be an indicator for an acceptable level of hypnosis and anesthesia. Davidson and Czarnecki have reported that, at an end-tidal concentration of 1 MAC, the BIS for halothane was significantly greater than isoflurane (56.5 +/- 8.1 vs. 35.9 +/- 8.5). The explanation given is the fact that the volume concentration of the MAC value is inversely related to the BIS value. Accordingly, it is expected that the BIS value at 1 MAC of desflurane must be less than halothane and isoflurane.
This is a clinical cross-over, prospective, randomized double blinded study. 90 pediatric patients scheduled for below umbilical surgery, under general and caudal analgesia, were allocated into 4 study groups. The BIS values at a relatively equipotent doses of the previously mentioned agents were compared with each other in the same group and between other groups.
At a relatively equipotent doses, the mean BIS value for halothane {60.4 +/- 5.6} was significantly higher than isoflurane {45.5 +/- 9.2} and desflurane {38.5 +/- 9.2} P<0.001). Equivalent end-tidal doses of different inhalational anesthetics do not necessarily have the same effects on cortical and sub-cortical functions and consequently on EEG.
The use of a relatively equipotent end-tidal concentration of different inhalational agents may result in different BIS values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16749571/

Response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE) are multifactor, dimensionless parameters of a new technology of EEG monitoring, and we investigated them for the first time in acupuncture research within this study. Both parameters have been alleged to reflect changes in the clinical state of sedation. Two different acupuncture schemes were tested in a randomized crossover trial with nine healthy volunteers (mean age +/- sd, 28.8 +/- 3.6 yr; 25-36 yr). Applying and stimulating acupuncture needles or performing laserneedle acupuncture at special sedation points decreased RE and SE significantly (P < or = 0.01; paired t-test) compared with the reference interval before acupuncture. In contrast, acupuncture of points for increasing ""Qi-energy"" did not decrease parameters of entropy.

Clinical anaesthesiology,2006,"Tonner PH, Paris A, Scholz J","Sedation and analgesia are important components of care for critically ill patients. Avoiding over-as well as undersedation is of utmost importance as both states carry considerable risks and may influence outcome. The management of sedation has changed dramatically over the past two decades from providing a dosage level by which the patient was kept in a deep stage of anaesthesia to a current dosing strategy allowing the administration of drugs in line with individual need, resulting in most cases in a slightly sedated, cooperative patient. The importance of monitoring the level of sedation and analgesia has only recently been realised. Most importantly, regularly determining the appropriate level of sedation and analgesia as well as monitoring the desired level of sedation will help to minimise the adverse effects of sedation. Clinical sedation scales are, however, subjective, and most lack proper validation. Thus, an objective measure of sedation, such as the use of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters is desirable. Processed EEG algorithms such as the bispectral index were initially introduced into clinical practice as a tool to assess the depth of anaesthesia objectively in the operating room. However, patients under general anaesthesia differ from those in an intensive care unit. Accordingly, most results from studies evaluating the performance of processed EEG parameters in critically ill patients have not been satisfactory. At present, monitoring sedation with processed EEG parameters cannot generally be recommended.

Little is known of excitatory effects taking place in the central nervous system during this procedure. Because acute withdrawal is accompanied by N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)-receptor activation we tested whether the administration of the nonspecific N-methyl-d-aspartic acid antagonist S(+)-ketamine results in a reduction of hyperactivity in the central nervous system. Thirty-one patients with a long history of opioid abuse were acutely withdrawn with naltrexone during propofol/clonidine anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. Electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra as well as median nerve-evoked somatosensory potentials (SSEP) were determined at the following times: evening before detoxification (control), steady-state propofol/clonidine-anesthesia, 30 min after naltrexone administration, and 5 min and 60 min after additional S(+)-ketamine (1.5 mg/kg). Compared to steady-state anesthesia, naltrexone induced a decrease by 270% in the low delta (0.5-3 Hz) and an increase by 110% in the fast beta (13-30 Hz) domain of the EEG with only minor changes in the theta-(3-7 Hz) and alpha-(7-13 Hz) band. Simultaneously, mean amplitude of the late N(100) peak of the SSEP increased from 3.3 muV to 10.5 muV. The changes could be attenuated by the additional administration of S(+)-ketamine, 5 min and 60 min after injection. Cardiovascular changes were not a reliable index for monitoring acute withdrawal symptoms and determining termination of rapid opioid detoxification.

16618305,Use of BIS monitor in a child with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis.,Paediatric anaesthesia,2006,"Brandes IF, Stuth EA","We describe a case of a 14-year-old boy with congenital insensitivity to pain and anhidrosis (CIPA) who underwent tarsal tunnel release for tarsal tunnel syndrome. Because of abnormal pain perception, the patient's response to normally painful surgical stimuli is severely impaired and not adequately reflected in a corresponding rise in blood pressure or heart rate. This lack of autonomic feedback to pain stimuli may make it more difficult to assess whether anesthetic depth is adequate to prevent intraoperative awareness and thus to safely conduct anesthesia, especially if muscle paralysis is required for surgical indications. We describe for the first time the use of processed EEG monitoring with a BIS A-2000 monitor to gauge anesthetic depth in a patient with CIPA. Initial forehead bispectral index (BIS) values prior to induction were normal (98) and then ranged between 23 and 79 during the whole surgical procedure. Propofol and lidocaine were used for induction and deep extubation; isoflurane was used as the sole anesthetic for maintenance with concentrations ranging from 0.21% to 0.92% to maintain a target BIS of 40-60. Volatile anesthetic requirements remained low throughout the procedure and no narcotics were necessary during surgery. The BIS monitor served as an adequate tool to help avoid excessive use of volatile anesthetic while assuring a processed EEG consistent with unconsciousness and amnesia. After the patient had recovered and was oriented to place and time in the recovery room, he was asked whether he remembered anything about the surgery and the presence of a breathing tube in his mouth.

16618290,Measuring anesthesia in children using the EEG.,Paediatric anaesthesia,2006,Davidson AJ,"Advances in electroencephalogram (EEG) processing have produced new interest in measuring anesthesia using the EEG. There are a number of EEG-based anesthesia 'depth' monitors now available and their use in pediatric anesthesia is increasing. Although these monitors have been extensively studied in adults, there are relatively few studies examining their validity or use in children. To some extent we must rely on adult data. However, extrapolation of data from adults to children requires an in depth understanding of the physiology behind the data. The first question is what is being measured. What is anesthesia? A model of anesthesia has several components with arousal as a core component. Arousal can be linked to clinical observations, and correlates with anatomical and physiological studies. The EEG has characteristics that fairly consistently change with arousal during anesthesia, but the relationship between arousal and the EEG is imprecise and drug dependent. This relationship is the basis for using the EEG to measure anesthesia and provides only an indirect measure of consciousness and memory formation. A good understanding of how the EEG is related to anesthesia is essential when interpreting the EEG during anesthesia, and especially when extending the use of the EEG to measure anesthesia in children. Physiological studies in adults and children indicate that EEG-derived anesthesia depth monitors can provide an imprecise and drug-dependent measure of arousal. Although the outputs from these monitors do not closely represent any true physiological entity, they can be used as guides for anesthesia and in so doing have improved outcomes in adults. In older children the physiology, anatomy and clinical observations indicate the performance of the monitors may be similar to that in adults, although the clinical relevance of outcomes may be different. In infants their use cannot yet be supported in theory or in practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16618290/

During the anesthetic agent driven transition to unresponsiveness, nonstationary changes such as signal amplitude variations appear in electroencephalography. In this paper, it is studied whether the application of the approximate entropy (ApEn) method to electroencephalographic (EEG) signal produces a monotonic response curve during the transition from awareness to unresponsiveness. Data from fourteen patients, undergoing propofol anesthetic induction were studied. To optimize the ApEn performance, different parameter choices were carefully evaluated. It was assumed with our protocol, that the level of anesthesia changes monotonically with the elapsed induction time. The monotonicity of the ApEn change was assessed with the prediction probability statistic (PK). The monotonicity of the ApEn time-series depends on the parameters employed in the algorithm and the varying signal amplitude. Depending on the parameter values, the median PK value ranged from 0.886 to 0.527. Thus, a good directionality and concordance was observed, but the nonstationarity of the signal affected the results. In conclusion, EEG-based ApEn measure shows a nonlinear response during propofol induction. With a judicious choice of parameters, a monotonic response is confirmed using PK statistic.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16602573/
16602568,Quantifying cortical activity during general anesthesia using wavelet analysis.,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2006,"Zikov T, Bibian S, Dumont GA, Huzmezan M, Ries CR","This paper reports on a novel method for quantifying the cortical activity of a patient during general anesthesia as a surrogate measure of the patient's level of consciousness. The proposed technique is based on the analysis of a single-channel (frontal) electroencephalogram (EEG) signal using stationary wavelet transform (SWT). The wavelet coefficients calculated from the EEG are pooled into a statistical representation, which is then compared to two well-defined states: the awake state with normal EEG activity, and the isoelectric state with maximal cortical depression. The resulting index, referred to as the wavelet-based anesthetic value for central nervous system monitoring (WAV(CNS)), quantifies the depth of consciousness between these two extremes. To validate the proposed technique, we present a clinical study which explores the advantages of the WAV(CNS) in comparison with the BIS monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, MA), currently a reference in consciousness monitoring. Results show that the WAV(CNS) and BIS are well correlated (r = 0.969) during periods of steady-state despite fundamental algorithmic differences. However, in terms of dynamic behavior, the WAV(CNS) offers faster tracking of transitory changes at induction and emergence, with an average lead of 15-30 s. Furthermore, and conversely to the BIS, the WAV(CNS) regains its preinduction baseline value when patients are responding to verbal command after emergence from anesthesia. We conclude that the proposed analysis technique is an attractive alternative to BIS monitoring. In addition, we show that the WAV(CNS) dynamics can be modeled as a linear time invariant transfer function. This index is, therefore, well suited for use as a feedback sensor in advisory systems, closed-loop control schemes, and for the identification of the pharmacodynamic models of anesthetic drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16602568/

Thirty-one patients of the World Federation of Neurosurgeons grades 1 and 2, undergoing embolization of cerebral artery aneurysms following acute subarachnoid haemorrhage, were recruited to have both BIS and entropy monitoring during general anaesthesia. BIS and entropy indices were matched to clinical indicators of anaesthetic depth. Anaesthetists were blinded to the anaesthetic depth monitoring indices. Analysis of data from monitoring devices allowed calculation of prediction probability (P(K)) constants, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to be performed.
BIS and entropy [response entropy (RE), state entropy (SE)] performed well in their ability to show concordance with clinically observed anaesthetic depth. P(K) values were generally high (BIS 0.966-0.784, RE 0.934-0.663, SE 0.857-0.701) for both forms of monitoring. ROC curve analysis shows a high sensitivity and specificity for all monitoring indices when used to detect the presence or absence of eyelash reflex. Area under curve for BIS, RE and SE to detect the absence or presence of eyelash reflex was 0.932, 0.888 and 0.887, respectively. RE provides earlier warning of return of eyelash reflex than BIS.

Advances in ophthalmology,2005,Niemeyer G,"ERG components of negative polarity in the light-adapted and in the dark-adapted inner retina are reviewed from a clinical perspective and include consideration of experimental research. Field potentials are inherently complex including summating contributions from specialized neurons as well as from glial elements. This property applies to the PERG, PhNR and to the STR. Experimental research can contribute to identifying the sites/cells of origins i.e. by determining depth profiles and by pharmacological manipulation. Intraretinal microelectrode-studies and pharmacological dissection of light-evoked responses have elucidated the origin of field potentials from the retinal pigment epithelium to the retinal ganglion cells. Thresholds for dark-adapted response components have been compared. Attenuation of the STR by anesthesia was found in cats in vivo when compared to threshold intensities used in isolated eye preparations in vitro, suggestive of depression of inner retinal activity by anesthetics. Evidence has been presented for antidromically elicited retinal responses of negative polarity that resemble the STR and summate with the light-evoked retinal response. This observation supports the notion that negative field potentials and components as recorded in the vitreous and at the cornea receive contributions from retinal ganglion cells.

The EEG was recorded from eight bipolar electrode derivations and Z-transformed relative to age expected normative data for relative power in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Tracheal intubation resulted in classical cortical arousal, as indicated by acceleration of the EEG frequencies. Significant effects were seen in all frequency bands, most pronounced in the alpha frequency band, with the largest increase bilaterally in the fronto-temporal regions (F-values: Delta - 9.592, P < 0.001; theta - 1.691, P < 0.001; alpha - 18.439, P < 0.001; beta - 4.504, P < 0.001). Changes in alpha and delta power during induction of anesthesia were correlated with the dose of etomidate (P < 0.05). Changes in alpha after tracheal intubation were correlated at the parietooccipital brain regions to the dose of sufentanil (P < 0.05). Individual titration of the dose of etomidate and sufentanil, as during routine clinical practice, is not sufficient to block the strong noxious stimulation of tracheal intubation and results in cortical arousal. The clinical impact of this cortical wake-up phenomenon is undetermined.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16492836/

the Dual Channel Brain Activity, ABM2 (DATEX) was used to continuously monitor frontal EMG and electrical cerebral activities (i.e. frequency and amplitude) of both hemispheres in 20 adult female patients undergoing balanced anesthesia in Maharaj Chiang Mai Hospital. The eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive 1.0 MAC, 1.2MAC, 1.4MAC or 1.6MAC of a mixture of sevoflurane and 66.67% nitrous oxide in oxygen during anesthesia. The anesthesia was induced with 5 mg/kg thiopental and supplemented with 1-1.5 microgram per kilogram of fentanyl. The standard dose of pancuronium or atracurium was given during maintenance.
After induction with 5 mg/kg thiopental, the mean (95% confidence interval) of frontal EMG significantly decreased from 2.66 (1.63,4.29) to 1.41 (0.2,1.61). When eyelash reflex was absent, the mean (95%CI) frequency and amplitude of the right frontal EEG was 3.89 (3.29, 4.497) Hz, 39.58 (32.11, 47.05) microvolt and left frontal EEG was 3.84 (3.43, 4.25) Hz, 33.55 (28.59, 38.61) microvolt. The findings were consistent with the raw EEG shown on the monitor, i.e. a progressive decrease in the frequency and an increase in the amplitude. During maintenance with the inhaled anesthetics, there was a statistically significant decrease in frequency of right frontal in those who had received the inhaled anesthetic concentration to reach 1.4 and 1.65 MAC (p < 0.05) (repeated measure ANOVA). At the steady state of end tidal concentration of the sevoflurane there was consistency in decreasing frequencies and increasing amplitudes of both hemispheres of the groups with higher MAC values (p < 0.05) (Table 3). However, the authors failed to demonstrate the relationships between EEG changes and other clinical responses.

We analysed the effect of a remifentanil bolus on the bispectral index of the electroencephalogram (bispectral index) under total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil.
ASA I-III patients were included in this study. All patients received a 2 microg k g-1 remifentanil bolus in a period free from stimuli. Bispectral index and haemodynamic data were collected from an A-2000XP bispectral index monitor (every second) and an AS/3 Datex monitor (every 5 s). Bispectral index data were analysed using the area under the curve. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were averaged at each 30-s period and analysed using analysis of variance.
A total of 240 bispectral index values were obtained per patient. The area under the curve between 90 and 120 s after the bolus was significantly lower than the basal area under the curve (average of all areas before the bolus, P < 0.05). Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly reduced from 96.4 +/- 19.9 mmHg at the time of the bolus to 74.2 +/- 16.6 mmHg 120 s after, and from 70 +/- 16.4 bpm at the time of the bolus to 61 +/- 13.6 bpm after (P < 0.001), respectively.
There was a significant reduction in the areas under the curve between 90-120 s following the bolus. Heart rate and blood pressure also showed significant reductions. Thus, remifentanil bolus given under total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil decreases bispectral index, an effect independent of intubation and surgical stimuli.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16469208/

Level of sedation was determined both clinically using the Ramsay and the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scales and with 2 EEG measures (the Bispectral Index version XP [BIS XP] or the Patient State Analyzer [PSA 4000]). Correlation between these 2 measures of sedation were tested using nonparametric statistical tests.
The BIS XP monitor was used in 26 patients, and the PSA 4000 monitor was used in 24 patients. The Ramsay and Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scores correlated with each other (r = -0.96; P < .001) and with both the BIS XP (r = -0.89 and r = 0.91, respectively; P < .001) and the PSA 4000 (r = -0.80 and r = 0.80, respectively; P < .001) values.

Its widespread use makes it the most-studied and the best-known among same intended devices. Its algorithm processes low-frequency EEG oscillations in order to provide the Bispectral index. A BIS index ranging from 40 to 60 has been established as the proper for surgical performance. The BIS monitor permits a closer approach to the hypnotic component of anaesthesia beyond clinical signs and may reduce the probability of intraoperative awareness; therefore, it has become a recommended monitoring tool in routine practice. The SNAP monitor (Nicolet Biomedical, Madison WI, USA) is also intended for monitoring the hypnotic effect of anaesthetics, which is in turn displayed as an index ranging from 100 to 0, with 100 meaning a fully awake state and 0 meaning no brain activity. The algorithm of the SNAP monitor is featured by its additional processing of ultra-high EEG frequencies, which seem to be involved in the formation of consciousness. The use of these frequencies would theoretically improve responsiveness during increased brain activity. We studied its behaviour patterns and capability to monitor the hypnotic effect induced by sevoflurane-nitrous oxide by comparison with the BIS index. Seventy patients ASA I-III were induced with propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium, and maintained with sevoflurane-N(2)O. BIS and SNAP indices were simultaneously recorded before induction, after intubation, after incision, at the following 10, 30 and 50 minutes, awakening and extubation time points, together with heart rate and blood pressure. The Pearson correlation was R(2) = 0.68 (p < .05). The Bland and Altman test showed a bias of 14.3 for SNAP index values with respect to BIS index values. We concluded that the SNAP index correlates with variations in the hypnotic effect induced by sevoflurane-nitrous oxide anaesthesia when compared with the BIS index. In this context, a SNAP index ranging from 58 to 70 would be equivalent to the BIS index range 40 to 60 and, therefore, the accurate for surgical performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16437288/

The objective was to determine the degree of agreement between the two monitors.
Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl (0.1 mg) in 38 patients undergoing general anaesthesia for routine day-surgery. Maintenance anaesthesia (sevoflurane (20/38), desflurane (10/38) or propofol (8/38)) titrated by BIS XP (Aspect Medical, Natwick, MA, USA) and BIS and CSI (cerebral State Monitor, Danmeter; Odense, Denmark) index values were recorded every minute. No patient received muscle relaxation. Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation rating scale was used to assess level of sedation.
Pair-wise recordings (914) of CSI and BIS were collected. The indices showed similar pattern and decreased with increasing level of sedation, however with large ranges for each level of sedation. Median indices were similar during surgery (BIS: 50 (14-89); CSI: 51 (7-88)) and both indices increased (P 20% from BIS-index in 24% of readings, and on rare occasions CSI indices deviated >100% from the BIS reading. When BIS < 40, CSI decreased slower than BIS and with wider spreading.
When used for day-surgery anaesthesia without muscle relaxation, CSI and BIS show similar patterns and numerical values but with the incidence of occasionally large discrepancies between pair-wise readings.

We evaluated the variation of pulse plethysmography amplitude induced by an electrical tetanic stimulus (PPG variation) as a potential measure for analgesia and predictor of haemodynamic responsiveness during general anaesthesia.
Ninety-five patients, ASA I or II, were randomly assigned to five groups [Group 1: bispectral index (BIS) (range) 40-50, effect site remifentanil concentration 1 ng ml(-1);Group 2: BIS 40-50, remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1); Group 3: BIS 40-50, remifentanil 4 ng ml(-1); Group 4: BIS 25-35, remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1); Group 5: BIS 55-65, remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1)]. A 60 mA tetanic stimulus was applied for 5 s on the ulnar nerve. From the digitized pulse oximeter wave recorded on a laptop computer, linear and non-linear parameters of PPG variation during the 60 s period after stimulation were computed. The haemodynamic response to subsequent orotracheal intubation was recorded. The PPG variation was compared between groups and between responders and non-responders to intubation (anova). Variables independently predicting the response were determined by logistic regression.
The probability of a response to tracheal intubation was 0.77, 0.47, 0.05, 0.18 and 0.52 in Groups 1-5, respectively (P<0.03). The PPG variability was significantly higher in responders than in non-responders but it did not improve the prediction of the response to tracheal intubation based on BIS level and effect site remifentanil concentration.

In the present study we sought to derive a PKPD model of the relationship between sevoflurane concentration and spectral entropy of the EEG. We collected spectral entropy data during increasing and decreasing sevoflurane anesthesia from 20 patients. The first cycle consisted of induction and lightening phases with no supplemental medications. An effect-site compartment and inhibitory E(max) model described the relation between sevoflurane concentration and spectral entropy. PKPD parameters were derived from the full cycle and separately from the increasing and decreasing stages. The second anesthetic cycle consisted of a redeepening phase only and included airway manipulation and routinely administered adjunctives. PKPD data obtained from the first cycle were used to predict second cycle entropy changes. There was a consistent relationship between effect-site sevoflurane concentration and spectral entropy (median absolute weighted residual = 11.6%). For complete first-cycle response entropy (mean +/- sd): T1/2 K(eo) = 2.4 +/- 1.5 min, gamma = 5.9 +/- 2.3, EC50 = 1.7 +/- 0.3. We found significant differences between gamma values when the sevoflurane concentration was increasing (61.1 +/- 55.2) compared with the decreasing part of the cycle (5.7 +/- 2.8). Above an effect-site concentration of 3%, spectral entropy of the EEG is unresponsive to further increases in sevoflurane concentration. The effect-compartment inhibitory E(max) model accurately describes the relation between sevoflurane concentration and spectral entropy of the EEG. Spectral entropy decreases with increasing sevoflurane concentrations up to 3%. The steepness of the dose-response curve varies between phases of increasing and decreasing anesthetic concentrations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16368811/

We reviewed retrospectively 102 consecutive CEAs performed in 102 patients with routine EEG monitoring and general anesthesia between March 1998 and October 2002. There were 65 (66%) symptomatic and 37 (34%) asymptomatic individuals. A protocol of induced arterial hypertension against EEG ischemic changes during carotid artery cross clamping was followed. Only patients with EEG changes refractory to induced hypertension went into etomidate-induced burst suppression.
EEG changes were classified as mild, moderate and severe. Twenty patients (19.6%) developed asymmetric EEG changes, of which the great majority were mild and moderate (75%, p< 0.05). Seven patients with moderate (n=3) and severe (n=4) EEG changes needed etomidate cerebral protection. There were no mortalities and only one stroke (0.98%) is reported in the series. The morbidity rate was 6.8% and included transient cranial nerve palsies (n=5) and wound hematoma (n=1).

Owing to repeated and lengthy shortages of amobarbital, causing delays in elective surgery, attempts have been made to find a suitable alternative anesthetic. The authors report their experience using etomidate, a widely used agent for the induction of anesthesia.
Sixteen consecutive patients requiring IAP to evaluate memory or to lateralize speech underwent the procedure using etomidate. Prior to the procedure a catheter was placed in the internal carotid artery and an angiogram was performed. EEG was recorded and read online by an electroencephalographer. An anesthetist injected the drug, administered by bolus followed by an infusion, which was maintained until each speech measure had been sampled and new memory items had been introduced. The infusion was then stopped and testing continued as in a standard IAP.
In all cases (30 hemispheres) contralateral hemiplegia followed injection. EEG slow waves were observed in every injected hemisphere, with some contralateral slowing anteriorly in 18. Global aphasia with preserved attention and cooperation followed dominant-hemisphere injections. These phenomena remained during infusion, and upon its termination returned gradually to baseline over a period of about 4 minutes.
Etomidate is a viable alternative to amobarbital, and its administration by bolus followed by infusion offers an improvement over the traditional intracarotid amobarbital procedure.

Artefact-free epochs of spindle activation were selected from the electroencephalograms of opiate-dependent patients undergoing rapid opiate detoxification. Power spectral analysis and source localization using low-resolution-brain-electromagnetic-tomography (LORETA(Key)) were performed.
Sinusoidal rhythms with waxing and waning amplitudes appeared after propofol-induced narcosis but no direct correlations could be determined between individual dosage and characteristic spindle attributes. The power maximum stood midline over the cortical areas, especially around C(z). We calculated a peak frequency of 14(+/-1.2) Hz. Motor fields, particularly in the frontal, parietal, and various cingulate areas, were found to be the primary sources of spindle oscillations in the cortex.
The frequent occurrence of these localized spindle sources demonstrates the preference for motor fields. Spindle oscillations observed during propofol-induced narcosis were similar in frequency and shape to those observed in natural sleep.
The results lend support to models that postulate a close link between the motor system and the organization of behavior. In addition, spindle rhythms under propofol bore some resemblance to spindle types which occur during sleep.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16326139/

Respiratory-related evoked potentials were described through the averaging of electroencephalogram (EEG) epochs following mid-inspiratory occlusions (C3-CZ; C4-CZ). A total of 21 healthy volunteers (13 male, aged 22-52 yrs) were studied during mouth breathing, before and after topical upper airway anaesthesia (lidocaine). Moreover, 15 subjects were studied during nose breathing with and without anaesthesia. Six subjects were studied whilst inhaling L-menthol. Typical potentials were present in all the subjects, their components featuring normal amplitudes and latencies. The route of breathing and upper airway anaesthesia did not modify the EEG responses to inspiratory occlusions, qualitatively or quantitatively, during mouth or nose breathing. L-menthol had no effect. Upper airway receptors sensitive to topical anaesthesia are unlikely to contribute significantly to mid-inspiratory occlusion-evoked potentials.

The induction of a seizure is a core event in successful ECT. Although propofol is a frequently used anesthetic agent, one of its limitations is a reduction of seizure duration. No such effects have been reported regarding remifentanil, an ultrarapid-acting opioid that is used to induce and maintain anesthesia. The simultaneous administration of propofol and remifentanil may have similar safety and efficacy in terms of induction of anesthesia during ECT as propofol alone and significantly increase seizure duration.
Twenty-one ECT patients (10 men, 11 women, aged 24 to 81 years) were recruited. Muscle paralysis was achieved with succinylcholine (0.5-0.75 mg/kg intravenously [IV]). Unconsciousness was induced by either propofol (1 mg/kg IV) or propofol (0.5 mg/kg IV) + remifentanil (1 microg/kg) in a crossover format. ECT was administered according to established clinical protocols at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel. No changes in ECT current were permitted in the 2 protocols of each patient. Statistical analysis was based on paired t tests.
In all but 2 cases, seizure duration was significantly longer in the remifentanil group than in the control group (motor seizure 53.7 +/- 28.3 seconds vs. 29.5 +/- 10.9 seconds, t = 4.017, P = 0.0007; Electroencephalographic (EEG) seizures 60.8 +/- 25.1 seconds vs. 40.1 +/- 17.0 seconds, t = 3.971, P = 0.001). No significant differences were found in mean recovery time, post-treatment elevation in blood pressure, heart-beat, or oxygen saturation.
During anesthesia, the addition of remifentanil to propofol appears to be as effective as propofol alone with regard to anesthesia efficacy and cardiovascular function while significantly increasing seizure duration.

Due to the possible presence of residual postoperative neuromuscular blockade after surgery, a processed electroencephalograph (EEG) was applied prior to starting sedation. This was markedly abnormal in all three cases, and not in keeping with the residual anesthesia. The patients were immediately transported for a CT scan. In all three cases there was severe neurological injury incompatible with survival and end of life decisions were made. Although the utility of quantitative EEG technology, like the Bispectral index (BIS) or Patient State Analyzer (PSA), is becoming better defined in the operating room, the role in the ICU is less clear. We propose that the ICU use of the PSA 4000 may have affected our decision weighing the risk versus benefit of transporting a fresh postoperative case to the radiology suite, expedited the neurological diagnosis, and may have reduced overall ICU resource utilization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16244845/

This may not be true during recovery from succinylcholine induced paralysis. We evaluated State entropy of the electroencephalogram (EEG, 0.8-32 Hz) and Response entropy, a combined measure of the electromyogram (EMG) and EEG (0.8-47 Hz), during recovery from paralysis with succinylcholine.
Twenty patients were randomized to receive either 0.8% (n = 10) or 1.4% isoflurane (n = 10), with 2 mg/kg succinylcholine administered for paralysis in all patients. State entropy and Response entropy were evaluated using a Datex-Ohmeda Entropy module. Frontal EMG was measured separately by an EEG module. State entropy, Response entropy, and EMG were measured in awake patients, during isoflurane anesthesia and paralysis, and after 100% recovery to train of four stimulation.
Response entropy and State entropy decreased from awake levels in a dose related manner during 0.8% or 1.4% isoflurane and succinylcholine. Recovery from succinylcholine significantly increased Response entropy and EMG in 5 of 10 patients with 0.8% isoflurane and 8 of 10 with 1.4% isoflurane without a change in State entropy.
Although RE and EMG increased during recovery from paralysis with succinylcholine, SE, an indicator of EEG, was not stimulated. EMG activity may not be an indicator of patient arousal after succinylcholine treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16244842/
16242555,Correlation of carotid artery stump pressure and neurologic changes during 474 carotid endarterectomies performed in awake patients.,Journal of vascular surgery,2005,"Calligaro KD, Dougherty MJ","A carotid artery stump pressure (SP) of < 50 mm Hg and abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) changes have been suggested as indications for selective shunting in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) under general anesthesia. We attempted to determine the optimal SP threshold that correlated with neurologic changes in awake patients undergoing CEA using cervical block anesthesia (CBA) and performed a cost comparison with EEG monitoring.
Between July 1, 1995, and December 31, 2004, SP was measured during 474 CEAs performed under CBA by inserting a 19-gauge butterfly needle into the common carotid artery. A saline-filled intravenous bag in the patient's contralateral hand was connected to pressure tubing to generate waveforms with hand squeezing that could be visualized on a monitor. Systemic pressure was maintained approximately 10 mm Hg higher than baseline. Accurate SPs were confirmed by the finding of flatline waveforms after internal carotid artery clamping. Selective shunting was performed when neurologic changes occurred (aphasia, inability to squeeze the contralateral hand, decreased consciousness), regardless of SP. During this same period, 142 patients underwent CEA using GA, and SP was also measured.
Shunting was necessary because of neurologic changes in 7.2% (34/474) of all CEAs performed using CBA: 0.9% (3/335) with SPs > or = 50 mm Hg systolic vs 1.0% (4/402) with SPs > or = 40 mm Hg systolic, and 22% (31/139) with SPs < 50 mm Hg systolic vs 42% (30/72) with SPs < 40 mm Hg systolic. If these 474 CEAs had been performed using GA, shunts would have been used in 29% (139/474) of patients for a SP < 50 mm Hg systolic vs 15% (72/474) for a SP < 40 mm Hg systolic. In patients not shunted, the perioperative stroke/death rate was 1.2% in patients (4/332) with SPs > or = 50 mm Hg vs 1.0% (4/398) with SPs > or = 40 mm Hg. Three of the four strokes occurred > 24 hours postoperatively and were unrelated to lack of shunting and ischemia. There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with SPs > or = 50 mm Hg who underwent CEA using CBA (70%, 335/474) vs GA (67%, 96/142) during this time period. At our hospital, charges for SPe measurement, including anesthesia charges and tubing, were 229 dollars per case vs 3439 dollars per case for EEG monitoring. Use of SP measurements in these 474 patients would have resulted in reduced charges of 1,521,540 dollars compared with EEG monitoring if CEA had been performed under GA.
Using 40 mm Hg systolic as a threshold, the need for shunting (15%) and the false-negative rate (1.0%) for SP in our series were equivalent to the results of EEG monitoring during CEA reported in the literature. However, charges for SP measurements are dramatically lower compared with EEG monitoring. Our results suggest that a carotid artery SP > or = 40 mm Hg systolic may be considered as an equally reliable but more cost-effective method to predict the need for carotid shunting during CEA under GA compared with EEG monitoring, but further investigation is warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16242555/

To evaluate the effects of fluvoxamine on the kinetics and dynamics of single doses of caffeine.
Seven healthy subjects received single 250 mg doses of caffeine (or matching placebo) together with fluvoxamine (four doses of 100 mg over 2 days) or with matching placebo in a double-blind, four-way crossover study. For 24 h after caffeine or placebo administration, plasma caffeine and fluvoxamine concentrations were determined. Psychomotor performance, sedation, and electroencephalographic (EEG) ""beta"" frequency activity were also assessed.
Fluvoxamine significantly reduced apparent oral clearance of caffeine (105 vs. 9.1 mL min(-1), P < 0.01; mean difference: 95.7 mL min(-1), 95% CI: 54.9-135.6), and prolonged its elimination half-life (4.9 vs. 56 h, P < 0.01; mean difference: 51 h, 95% CI: 26-76). Caffeine produced CNS-stimulating effects compared with placebo. However, psychomotor performance, alertness, or EEG effects attributable to caffeine were not augmented by coadministration of fluvoxamine.

As olanzapine and clozapine share many pharmacological properties, we investigated whether EEG slowing during olanzapine treatment was related to therapy outcome and sleepiness in patients with schizophrenia. Participants were age- and gender-matched schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine (n 54), receiving no pharmacological treatment (n 54), or cotreated with olanzapine and some other psychotropic drug (n 38). Their EEG recordings were assessed visually by the same rater blind to clinical data. The EEG scores were categorized using standardized forms. Patients with a poor treatment response did not differ significantly from those with a good response to treatment either in EEG patterns or in frequency of sleepiness. Olanzapine treatment was associated with increased rates of slow (70.4% vs. 22.3%) and sharp waves (22.2% vs. 7.4%), as well as of paroxysmal slow wave discharges (14.8% vs. 1.9%), but did not induce spike- or sharp-slow-wave complexes. Cotreatment with another antipsychotic further increased EEG abnormalities, whereas benzodiazepine administration diminished the olanzapine-induced EEG changes. The results show that olanzapine inducing both slow and sharp waves, as well as paroxysmal discharges, has a strong impact on EEG. However, as no spike- or sharp-slow-wave complexes were observed, the risk of epileptic seizure during olanzapine treatment can be regarded as low, as long as olanzapine is not combined with some other antipsychotic.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16204327/

Clinical assessment scales are not reliable in deeply sedated patients. Parameters obtained from spectral and bispectral analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) records have been combined to create an index (BIS) to monitor anesthesia depth. The role of such parameters in monitoring the depth of the sedation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients has yet to be determined. We designed the present prospective study to redefine and calculate available spectral and bispectral parameters from raw EEG records and estimate their clinical relevance for the diagnosis of under- or oversedation levels in ICU patients. Forty adult patients receiving continuous midazolam and morphine sedation were included. We obtained 167 clinical evaluations of sedation level using Ramsay and COMFORT scales along with an EEG record of 300 s. Six spectral parameters-relative power of 4 frequency bands (beta, alpha, Theta, and delta), 95th percentile of the power spectrum (SEF95), and 50th percentile of the power spectrum (SEF50) and four bispectral parameters, real triple product, bispectrum (Bispectrum), bicoherence, and ratio 10-were calculated. The relevance of each of these parameters and combinations in predicting too light (Ramsay 1 and 2) or deep (Ramsay 5 and 6) sedation levels was assessed. These calculations were performed before and after exclusion of the agitated patients, whose COMFORT 4 score was above 2. The most relevant parameters for predicting levels of deep sedation (Ramsay 5 and 6) were ratio 10 (area under the curve = 0.763; 95% confidence interval, 0.679-0.833) and SEF95 (area under the curve = 0.687; 95% confidence interval, 0.597-0.767). The most relevant parameters for predicting light levels of sedation (Ramsay 1 and 2) were also ratio 10 (area under the curve = 0.829; 95% confidence interval, 0.695-0.917) and SEF95 (area under the curve = 0.798; 95% confidence interval, 0.650-0.898). There is a modest improvement in relevance of their linear combination in predicting sedation level. Results were similar after exclusion of agitated patients. We conclude that various calculated EEG descriptive parameters exhibited large interindividual variability. There was a strong correlation between EEG spectral and bispectral parameters. Bispectral analysis slightly improves the predictive power of simple spectral analysis in distinguishing too light or deep sedation levels in ICU patients.

16186033,Hysterical conversion and brain function.,Progress in brain research,2005,Vuilleumier P,"Hysterical conversion disorders represent ""functional"" or unexplained neurological deficits such as paralysis or somatosensory losses that are not explained by organic lesions in the nervous system, but arise in the context of ""psychogenic"" stress or emotional conflicts. After more than a century of both clinical and theoretical interest, the exact nature of such emotional disorders responsible for hysterical symptoms, and their functional consequences on neural systems in the brain, still remain largely unknown. However, several recent studies have used functional brain imaging techniques (such as EEG, fMRI, PET, or SPECT) in the attempt to identify specific neural correlates associated with hysterical conversion symptoms. This article presents a general overview of these findings and of previous neuropsychologically based accounts of hysteria. Functional neuroimaging has revealed selective decreases in the activity of frontal and subcortical circuits involved in motor control during hysterical paralysis, decreases in somatosensory cortices during hysterical anesthesia, or decreases in visual cortex during hysterical blindness. Such changes are usually not accompanied by any significant changes in elementary stages of sensory or motor processing as measured by evoked potentials, although some changes in later stages of integration (such as P300 responses) have been reported. On the other hand, several neuroimaging results have shown increased activation in limbic regions, such as cingulate or orbitofrontal cortex during conversion symptoms affecting different sensory or motor modalities. Taken together, these data generally do not support previous proposals that hysteria might involve an exclusion of sensorimotor representations from awareness through attentional processes. They rather seem to point to a modulation of such representations by primary affective or stress-related factors, perhaps involving primitive reflexive mechanisms of protection and alertness that are partly independent of conscious control, and mediated by dynamic modulatory interactions between limbic and sensorimotor networks. A better understanding of the neuropsychobiological bases of hysterical conversion disorder might therefore be obtained by future imaging studies that compare different conversion symptoms and employ functional connectivity analyses. This should not only lead to improve clinical management of these patients, but also provide new insights on the brain mechanisms of self-awareness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16186033/
16183678,Performance of entropy and Bispectral Index as measures of anaesthesia effect in children of different ages.,British journal of anaesthesia,2005,"Davidson AJ, Huang GH, Rebmann CS, Ellery C","Entropy and Bispectral Index (BIS) have been promoted as EEG-based anaesthesia depth monitors. The EEG changes with brain maturation, but there are limited published data describing the characteristics of entropy in children, and some data suggest that BIS is less reliable in young children. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of entropy as a measure of anaesthetic effect in different age groups. The performance of entropy was compared with BIS.
Fifty-four children receiving a standard sevoflurane anaesthetic for cardiac catheter studies were enrolled. The entropy and BIS were recorded pre-awakening and at 1.5%, 2% and 2.5% steady-state end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations. For analysis children were divided into four age groups: 0-1 yr, 1-2 yr, 2-4 yr and 4-12 yr.
The pre-awakening values were obtained in 46 children. The median pre-awakening values for entropy and BIS varied significantly across ages with the values being lowest in the 0-1 yr age group (response entropy: 45 vs 84, 87 and 89, P=0.003; state entropy: 36 vs 78, 74 and 77, P=0.009; BIS: 56 vs 78, 76.5 and 72, P=0.02). Values were recorded at all three sevoflurane concentrations in 48 children. Compared with older groups, the 0-1 yr age group had the least significant difference in BIS and entropy when compared among different sevoflurane concentrations. The calculated sevoflurane concentrations to achieve mid-scale values of entropy and BIS were highest in the 1-2 yr age group, lower in the 0-1 yr age group and progressively lower in the 2-4 and 4-12 yr age groups.
For both entropy and BIS the measure of anaesthetic effect was significantly different for children aged <1 yr compared with older children. There was no difference in performance of entropy and BIS. Both should be used cautiously in small children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16183678/

16175141,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in clinical use of scopolamine.,Therapeutic drug monitoring,2005,"Renner UD, Oertel R, Kirch W","The alkaloid L-(-)-scopolamine [L-(-)-hyoscine] competitively inhibits muscarinic receptors for acetylcholine and acts as a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, producing both peripheral antimuscarinic properties and central sedative, antiemetic, and amnestic effects. The parasympatholytic scopolamine, structurally very similar to atropine (racemate of hyoscyamine), is used in conditions requiring decreased parasympathetic activity, primarily for its effect on the eye, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and salivary and bronchial secretion glands, and in special circumstances for a CNS action. Therefore, scopolamine is most suitable for premedication before anesthesia and for antiemetic effects. This alkaloid is the most effective single agent to prevent motion sickness. Scopolamine was the first drug to be made commercially available in a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS-patch) delivering alkaloid. Recently, pharmacokinetic data on scopolamine in different biozlogic matrices were obtained most efficiently using liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) or gas chromatography online coupled to mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters are dependent on the dosage form (oral dose, tablets; parenteral application; IV infusion; SC and IM injection). Scopolamine has a limited bioavailability if orally administered. The maximum drug concentration occurs approximately 0.5 hours after oral administration. Because only 2.6% of nonmetabolized L-(-)-scopolamine is excreted in urine, a first-pass metabolism is suggested to occur after oral administration of scopolamine. Because of its short half-life in plasma and dose-dependent adverse effects (in particular hallucinations and the less serious reactions, eg, vertigo, dry mouth, drowsiness), the clinical use of scopolamine administered orally or parenterally is limited. To minimize the relatively high incidence of side effects, the transdermal dosage form has been developed. The commercially available TTS-patch contains a 1.5-mg drug reservoir and a priming dose (140 microg) to reach the steady-state concentration of scopolamine quickly. The patch releases 0.5 mg alkaloid over a period of 3 days (releasing rate 5 microg/h). Following the transdermal application of scopolamine, the plasma concentrations of the drug indicate major interindividual variations. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of approximately 100 pg/mL (range 11-240 pg/mL) of the alkaloid are reached after about 8 hours and achieve steady state. During a period of 72 hours the plaster releases scopolamine, so constantly high plasma levels (concentration range 56-245 pg/mL) are obtained, followed by a plateau of urinary scopolamine excretion. Although scopolamine has been used in clinical practice for many years, data concerning its metabolism and the renal excretion in man are limited. After incubation with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase, the recovery of scopolamine in human urine increased from 3% to approximately 30% of the drug dose (intravenously administered). According to these results from enzymatic hydrolysis of scopolamine metabolites, the glucuronide conjugation of scopolamine could be the relevant pathway in healthy volunteers. However, scopolamine metabolism in man has not been verified stringently. An elucidation of the chemical structures of the metabolites extracted from human urine is still lacking. Scopolamine has been shown to undergo an oxidative demethylation during incubation with CYP3A (cytochrome P-450 subfamily). To inhibit the CYP3A located in the intestinal mucosa, components of grapefruit juice are very suitable. When scopolamine was administered together with 150 mL grapefruit juice, the alkaloid concentrations continued to increase, resulting in an evident prolongation of tmax (59.5 +/- 25.0 minutes; P < 0.001). The AUC0-24h values of scopolamine were higher during the grapefruit juice period. They reached approximately 142% of the values associated with the control group (P < 0.005). Consequently, the related absolute bioavailabilities (range 6% to 37%) were significantly higher than the corresponding values of the drug orally administered together with water (range 3% to 27%). The effect of the alkaloid on quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) and cognitive performance correlated with pharmacokinetics was shown in studies with healthy volunteers. From pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling techniques, a direct correlation between serum concentrations of scopolamine and changes in total power in alpha-frequency band (EEG) in healthy volunteers was provided. The alkaloid readily crosses the placenta. Therefore, scopolamine should be administered to pregnant women only under observation. The drug is compatible with nursing and is considered to be nonteratogenic. In conclusion, scopolamine is used for premedication in anesthesia and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of scopolamine depend on the dosage form. Effects on different cognitive functions have been extensively documented.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16175141/

Fifty ASA physical status II and III inpatients undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy with a cervical plexus block.
rSo2 was continuously monitored throughout surgery, while an independent neurologist evaluated the occurrence of both clinical and EEG signs of cerebral ischemia induced during carotid cross-clamping.
rSo2 was recorded 1 and 3 minutes after clamping the carotid artery during a 3-minute clamping test. In 5 patients (10%), the carotid clamping test was associated with the occurrence of clinical and EEG signs of cerebral ischemia. All these patients were treated with the placement of a Javid shunt, which completely resolved the symptoms. In no patient was permanent neurological injury reported at hospital discharge. In 4 of these patients, EEG signs of cerebral ischemia were present at both observation times, and in one of them, the duration of cerebral ischemia was less than 2 minutes. The percentage rSo2 reduction from baseline during the carotid clamping test was 17% +/- 4% in patients requiring shunt placement and only 8% +/- 6% in those who did not require it (P = .01). A decrease in rSo2 15% or greater during the carotid clamping test was associated with a 20-fold increase in the odd for developing severe cerebral ischemia (odds ratio, 20; 95% confidence interval, 6.7-59.2) (P = .001); however, this threshold had a 44% sensitivity and 82% specificity, with only 94% negative predictive value.
Continuous rSo2 monitoring is a simple and noninvasive method that correlates with the development of clinical and EEG signs of cerebral ischemia during carotid cross-clamping; however, we could not identify an rSo2 threshold that can be used alone to predict the need for shunt placement because of the low sensitivity and specificity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16171662/
16167223,"Cerebral monitoring in the operating room and the intensive care unit - an introductory for the clinician and a guide for the novice wanting to open a window to the brain. Part II: Sensory-evoked potentials (SSEP, AEP, VEP).",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2005,Freye E,"An evoked potential differs from the EEG mainly in two ways: 1. The EEG is a random, continuous signal, which arises from the ongoing activity of the outer layers of the cortex. An evoked potential is the brain's response to a repetitive stimulus along a specific nerve pathway. 2.EEG signals range from 10-200 milliVolt (mV). Evoked potentials are smaller in amplitude (1-5-20 microVolt requiring precise electrode positioning and special techniques (signal averaging) to extract the specific response from the underlying EEG ""noise"". The technique of signal averaging, as originally described by Dawson in 1954 [69J, has been further developed in computer processing. The technique is now used by applying a stimulus repeatedly--preferably at randomized intervals--and to record the evoked response over the corresponding area of the brain, averaging out mathematically the change over the number of stimuli. Rationale for the use of EPs in the OR and the ICU. Evoked potentials (EPs) serve the following major purposes: 1. Monitoring of the functional integrity of neural structures that may be at risk during, for instance, ECC (extracorporeal circulation) or endarterectomy indicating cerebral hypoxia. 2. Monitoring of the effects of anesthetic agents and other centrally active drugs, which, besides the cortex, affect deeper neuronal structures. 3. Orthopedic cases where the spinal cord is at risk such as Harrington rod insertion and removal. 4. Clamping of the abdominal aortic artery during aneurysmectomy resulting in a potential damage of the lower parts of the spinal cord. 5. Clipping of an intracerebral aneurysm, which may be impeding blood flow to vital cerebral textures. 6. An indicator of cerebral hypoxia when the blood pressure is deliberately lowered. 7. Operation on peripheral nerves and nerve roots to identify early trauma. 8. Monitoring the cerebral function during controlled hypothermia when the EEG becomes flat. 9. Monitoring of the pathophysiological conditions after severe head trauma and the effects of therapy. 10. An intraoperative warning device of unsuspected awareness during light anesthesia when movement is abolished by muscle relaxants and cardiovascular responses are modified by vasoactive drugs. In case of the latter the stimulus is a small electrical potential applied to the skin of the hand. Thereafter, the stimulus travels along the specific nervous pathways inducing (= generating) potential activation at various sites. The generation of potential changes at various sites along the pathway is an index for the integrity of the nerve. Thus, the evoked potential can be considered a neurophysiological response (usually of the cortex) to impulses originating from some externally stimulated sensory nerve. They provide a physiological measure of the functional integrity of the sensory nerve pathway, which can be used as a clinical diagnostic tool as well as for intraoperative monitoring. The evoked potential usually is recorded from the specific cortical area corresponding to the stimulus input. The classification of evoked potentials. Stimulating a sensory nervous pathway induces evoked potentials. If the auditory nerve is stimulated by ""clicks"" from headphones, it is called the auditory evoked potential (AEP). The early part of the AEP waveform (less than 10 msec) is called the Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential (BAEP) since it reflects the passing of the impulse through the brainstem. If a nerve on the arm or the leg is stimulated by a small electrical current applied to the overlying skin, it is called the Somatosensory Evoked Potential (SSEP). If, however, the retina is stimulated by means of flicker light or a sudden change in a checkerboard pattern, the evoked potential thus recorded over the corresponding cortical area is called the Visual Evoked Potential (VEP). Evoked potentials are used both as a diagnostic tool and as a monitoring technique. As diagnostic tests, evoked potentials are useful to evaluate neurologic disorders such as: a) multiple sclerosis, b) acoustic nerve tumors, and c) optic neuritis. As a monitoring modality, evoked potentials are used during all surgical procedures, which might compromise part of the brain or the spinal cord.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16167223/
16167222,Cerebral monitoring in the operating room and the intensive care unit: an introductory for the clinician and a guide for the novice wanting to open a window to the brain. Part I: The electroencephalogram.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2005,"Freye E, Levy JV","While there is an increasing body of knowledge in regard to central nervous system function and/or the mode of action of centrally active agents on neuronal function, little is done to develop new techniques on how to measure such changes. Also, monitoring of the cardiovascular system in the past has made extensive progress especially when it comes to evaluate the failing heart. In contrast monitoring of the central nervous system is only done in rare cases where operative procedures likely impede nervous function integrity. Since in the past decade the aging population undergoing operation has rise considerably, the risk of cerebral malperfusion or minute signs of degradation of the aging central nervous system (CNS) to anesthetics and agents being used in the operation room (OR) or the intensive care unit (ICU), needs continuous monitoring of an organ which presents the highest vulnerability and is likely to deteriorate faster than the cardiovascular system. In spite the rapid improvement in technology regarding the electroencephalogram (EEG) and evoked potential monitoring, physicians still are reluctant to use a technology on a routine base, which will give them insight information into brain function and activity. Such ""windows to the brain"" now not just are reserved to specialists working in the area of neurology and/or psychiatry. More so, cerebral monitoring is getting an integrated part in the overall therapy in patients undergoing operation or who need ventilatory support in the ICU as it effects the well-being and the outcome. The present book therefore, is intended for the practitioners who work with the patient, guide the clinician in his decision making and outlining those situations where cerebral monitoring presents an integrated part in the diagnosis and therapy of patient care. Without going too much into the technical details, representative cases underline the potential use of cerebral monitoring in the underlying clinical situation where either the patient presents borderline perfusion of the CNS, undergoes vascular surgery, or where monitoring of cerebral function in the intensive care in a head trauma patients is an integrated part in therapy. The book therefore is meant for all those clinicians who have to deal with the CNS in a day-to-day situation. This may be the anesthesiologist, the surgeon, the intensive care therapist, the nurse anesthetist as well as all other medical personal involved in intensive care therapy. The aim of the book therefore is to outline the possibilities, the limitations, and the options for therapy when the windows to the brain are opened, how to interpret the data in the light of other physiological parameters and aid the user in the technical details of how to avoid artifacts in recording which may have an impact on final decision making. Therefore, emphasis is placed on the electrode placement, artifact and electrical noise reduction, as well as data interpretation so that cerebral function diagnosis can be made on reliable grounds. The following serves as an introduction to and as a reference guide for Cerebral Monitoring in the OR and the ICU: Gives complete coverage of EEG power spectra analysis. Describes in detail the EEG machines available to be used in the OR and ICU setting. Describes in detail the major features of EEG power spectra and evoked potential measurements, including amplifiers, filter setting and microprocessor algorithm for data reduction. Gives suggestions for assessing and improving signal quality, including noise and artifact rejection, which usually are encountered in the operation room and the intensive care unit, both of which can be considered as electrically contaminated. Gives examples of EEG power spectra and evoked potential monitoring related to different types of anesthesia, in coma, after head trauma, and for the detection of ischemic events. In addition, gives complete coverage of those machines being available for the OR and the ICU, including a list of parameters regarding latency and amplitude in evoked potential As an introductory, recommendations are given for the novice to start cerebral monitoring and guide the beginner in setting up cerebral monitoring in the clinical environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16167222/

A survey form was distributed by mail to 1648 Russian doctors and institutions expected to deal with ECT. A total of 114 replies were received. They indicated that ECT is available to 22.4% of the country's population. In available regions, ECT is given to 1.43% of hospital admissions and 0.54 per 10,000 persons per year. ECT is used in Russian psychiatry, neurology, and addictionology. Outdated ECT instruments are used in more than one third of sites, and EEG and seizure quality are virtually never monitored. Fewer than 20% of ECTs are modified with anesthesia. There is no system or expectation for ECT training or privileging, there is no national organization that aims to advance ECT practice, and ECT research is haphazard. Nevertheless, most respondents are enthusiastic and positive about ECT, and most institutions are eager to adopt modern ECT methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16127303/
16115989,Different conditions that could result in the bispectral index indicating an incorrect hypnotic state.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2005,Dahaba AA,"Since its introduction in 1996, the Bispectral Index (BIS) has gained increasing popularity in daily anesthesia practice. However, numerous reports have been appearing in the literature of paradoxical BIS changes and inaccurate readings. The purpose of this review is to assess the utility of BIS monitoring through examining the various published reports of all BIS values not coinciding with a clinically judged sedative-hypnotic state, whether arising from an underlying pathophysiology of electroencephalographic (EEG) cerebral function or because of shortcomings in the performance and design of the BIS monitor. High electromyographic activity and electric device interference could create subtle artifact signal pollution without their necessarily being displayed as artifacts. This would be misinterpreted by the BIS algorithm as EEG activity and assigned a spuriously increased BIS value. Numerous clinical conditions that have a direct effect on EEG cerebral function could also directly influence the BIS value.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16115989/

Some investigators recently analyzed changes in the BIS during natural sleep in adults and found that the BIS diminished considerably as sleep became deeper. No such studies have been undertaken to investigate changes in the BIS in sleeping children. The aim of this work was to assess the trend of the BIS in the various stages of sleep in a group of children, performing a descriptive analysis on a limited number of cases. We evaluated 15 children with negative clinical findings and a normal electroencephalogram (EEG) as part of their follow-up for prior episodes of epilepsy, recording the BIS and EEG in a waking state, in the various stages of sleep and on reawaking. For each stage, the mean value, the standard deviation, and the range of BIS values were calculated. The results showed that the BIS decreased progressively as sleep became deeper. The correlation between the stage of sleep and the BIS was significant. On reawaking, a slow increase was apparent in the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16115967/
16113760,Time-variant parametric estimation of transient quadratic phase couplings during electroencephalographic burst activity.,Methods of information in medicine,2005,"Schwab K, Eiselt M, Schelenz C, Witte H","Electroencephalographic burst activity characteristic of burst-suppression pattern (BSP) in sedated patients and of burst-interburst pattern (BIP) in the quiet sleep of healthy neonates have similar linear and non-linear signal properties. Strong interrelations between a slow frequency component and rhythmic, spindle-like activities with higher frequencies have been identified in previous studies. Time-varying characteristics of BSP and BIP prevent a definite patternrelated analysis. A continuous estimation of the bispectrum is essential to analyze these patterns. Parametric bispectral approaches provide this opportunity.
The adaptation of an AR model leads to a parametric bispectrum by using the transfer function of the estimated AR filter. Time-variant parametric bispectral approaches require an estimation of AR parameters which consider higher order moments to preserve phase information. Accordingly, a time-variant parametric estimation of the bispectrum was introduced. Data driven simulations were performed to provide optimal parameters. BSP (12 patients) and BIP (6 neonates) were analyzed using this novel approach.
Significant differences in the time course of burst pattern during BSP and burst-like pattern before the onset of BSP could be shown. A rhythmic quadratic phase coupling (period 10 sec) was identified during BIP in all neonates.
Quadratic phase couplings during BSP increases in the time course depending on depth of sedation. The visually detected burst activity in BIP is only the temporarily observable EEG correlate of a hidden neural process. Time-variant bispectral approaches offer the possibility of a better characterization of underlying neural processes leading to improved diagnostic tools used in clinical routine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16113760/

EEG can be used for this purpose, but there is no consensus on the variables to use. Using a database consisting of 149 EEGs recorded from patients during carotid endarterectomy under isoflurane (n=61) or propofol (n=88) anesthesia and who did or did not receive a shunt, the authors investigated which of 16 derivations (common reference, Cz) and 12 parameters (relative and absolute powers and spectral edge frequencies [SEFs]) singly or in combination could best distinguish between the shunt and the nonshunt groups for the two anesthesia regimens. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to select derivation/parameter combinations for three types of trend computation: (1) values of relative powers and SEFs during clamping (C) only, (2) clamp minus preclamp (baseline) differences (C-B), and (3) C-B differences in absolute logarithmic power (DeltalogP). For both anesthesia regimens, C-B computation distinguished best between the shunt and nonshunt groups. For isoflurane anesthesia, SEF parameters were the best, and for propofol anesthesia the relative power parameters. Discriminant analysis, in which additional derivation/parameter combinations were added, increased the discriminative power of the DeltalogP computation but not of the C or C-B computations. For isoflurane anesthesia, SEF 90% was the best single parameter for distinguishing between patients who did and did not need a shunt and the four best derivations were F3-Cz, P4-Cz, C4-Cz, and F7-Cz. For the propofol anesthesia, the relative power (C or C-B computations) of the delta band was the best and the four best derivations were F8-Cz, T4-Cz, C4-Cz, and F4-Cz.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16093896/

EEG was analyzed from sixteen patients, anesthetized with a fixed rate infusion of propofol (30 mg/kg/h). An artifact-purified EEG from electrode Fz referenced to the average of mastoid signals was filtered to consecutive 4 Hz frequency passbands with a filter bank. Signal envelope time-series were computed for all the passbands and studied as a function of the elapsed induction time t and as a function of the relative time r, which is t divided by the time of the LVC.
A frequency band specific biphasic activity pattern progressed from high towards low frequencies systematically and uniformly in the population studied when presented on the relative time scale r, irrespective of individual responses to the dosage.
The grouping of the individual progression patterns on the r scale indicates a strong relation between the EEG spectral behavior and the LVC.

The composite AEP index (AAI) is preferably calculated from the AEP, but in case of low signal quality it is based entirely on the spontaneous EEG. We investigated the impact of auditory input on the AAI in 16 patients with correctly positioned headphones for acoustic stimulation and headphones disconnected from the patient's ears under awake and anesthetized conditions. The AAI and the Narcotrend Index (NI), another EEG-based measure of hypnotic depth, were recorded simultaneously. AAI values under awake and anesthetized conditions were higher with correctly positioned headphones than with headphones disconnected from the patient's ears (P < 0.05) but remained within the range indicating the patient's actual hypnotic state as given by the manufacturer of the monitor. Under awake conditions with correctly positioned headphones we observed frequent fluctuations between AEP-derived and EEG-derived AAI, whereas with headphones disconnected from the patient's ears the AAI calculation was completely EEG based. Acoustic stimulation had no impact on the Narcotrend Index. Although relevant misinterpretations of the patient's hypnotic state as a consequence of a turnover from AEP-derived to EEG-derived AAI values should not occur, an improved harmonization of the two methods of indexing would be desirable.
The AEP Monitor/2 generates an Index (AAITM) indicating the patient's hypnotic state by analyzing either auditory evoked potentials (AEP) or spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. We demonstrate that, though significantly different under AEP-derived or EEG-derived conditions, AAI values remain within the range indicating the patient's actual hypnotic state as given by the manufacturer of the device.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16037158/

Tachycardia is also seen when the concentration of desflurane (D) is abruptly increased. It is not known whether this is associated with epileptiform EEG similar to S. We studied EEG and heart rate (HR) during rapidly increased concentrations of S or D in 31 females during the postintubation period of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and the tracheas were intubated. Patients were randomized to receive either S or D in nitrous oxide-oxygen mixture after intubation, at a small dose first. After 10 min, S or D vaporizer was advanced to the highest reading of the vaporizer (7% for S, 18% for D) for 5 min. HR and EEG were recorded. Epileptiform EEG activity was recorded in eight of 15 patients in group S and in none in group D (P < 0.05). HR increased in both groups. In group S, HR increased gradually and the highest HR value was 84 bpm at 5 min after the increase in sevoflurane concentration. In group D, HR increased to 93 bpm 2 min after the increase in desflurane concentration (no significant difference, S versus D). A rapid increase in the concentration of S frequently induces epileptiform EEG during normoventilation. Tachycardia during increasing concentrations of D is not associated with epileptiform EEG.
A rapid increase in the concentration of sevoflurane induces epileptiform encephalogram (EEG) with tachycardia. A rapid increase in the concentration of desflurane also induces tachycardia but is not associated with epileptiform EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16037151/

A total of 81 variables (31 EEG, 22 SSEP, 28 AEP) were simultaneously recorded in 48 surgical patients during anaesthesia. A total of 307 cases of the 81 variables in stable anaesthetic states were recorded. A factor analysis was performed for this data set.
Sixteen variables were excluded because of multicollinearity. We extracted 13 factors with eigenvalues >1, representing 78.3% of the total variance, from the remaining 65 x 307 matrix. The first three factors represented 12%, 11% and 10% of the total variance. Factor 1 had only significant loadings from EEG variables, factor 2 only significant loadings from AEP variables and factor 3 only significant loadings from SSEP variables.

Patients evaluated for surgery to control a seizure disorder undergo Wada testing, during which one hemisphere is rendered functionally inactive after injecting a short-acting barbiturate. We surmised that the BIS values would reflect these functional changes. Eight epileptic patients were enrolled. A full array of 21 EEG electrodes and 2 BIS XP (Quatro) strips over each frontal region of the scalp were applied. The EEG was continuously recorded. BIS values from each hemisphere were recorded every minute. Angiography was performed by advancing a catheter into each internal carotid artery. Amobarbital or methohexital was injected until the patient developed a hemiparesis. The EEG confirmed a significant lateralized cortical effect of the barbiturate. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze the differences between the BIS values from monitor electrode strips placed on the left (left BIS) and the right (right BIS) sides of the head as well as the differences in the left and right BIS values before and after each injection of the barbiturate. Injection of barbiturate into either the left or right internal carotid artery produced a significant change on the 21-electrode EEG. However, there was no difference between left BIS to right BIS values (P = 0.84). With repeated injections of barbiturates, some patients became sedated.

This open, randomized, explorative study of day surgical patients evaluates the ability of the Cerebral State Monitor (Danmeter AB, Odense, Denmark) of anaesthetic depth to identify loss of response (LOR) using either propofol or N(2)0 for induction.
In this open, randomized study, day surgical patients (n=10 in each group) were studied using the Cerebral State Index Monitor. After baseline measurements, induction to LOR was achieved with either repeated 30-mg boluses of propofol every second minute or with N(2)0 (after premedication 5 min before with 30 mg propofol) increased every other minute in 15% increments (max. 75%). Sedation level was evaluated every other minute using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale.
Baseline values were 91 (82-98) and 94 (82-100) for N(2)0 and propofol patients, respectively. During induction CSI decreased with increasing sedation in patients given propofol (P<0.001) but not in patients given nitrous oxide. Median value at LOR was 56 (40-76) and 95 (87-100) for the propofol and nitrous oxide group of patients, respectively.
The Cerebral State Index(trade mark) behaves as other depth of anaesthesia monitors with a progressive decrease during propofol induction but loss of consciousness with N(2)0 results in no change in CSI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15954953/

E, Statistical, nonlinear, and soft matter physics",2005,"Bojak I, Liley DT","Changes to the electroencephalogram (EEG) observed during general anesthesia are modeled with a physiological mean field theory of electrocortical activity. To this end a parametrization of the postsynaptic impulse response is introduced which takes into account pharmacological effects of anesthetic agents on neuronal ligand-gated ionic channels. Parameter sets for this improved theory are then identified which respect known anatomical constraints and predict mean firing rates and power spectra typically encountered in human subjects. Through parallelized simulations of the eight nonlinear, two-dimensional partial differential equations on a grid representing an entire human cortex, it is demonstrated that linear approximations are sufficient for the prediction of a range of quantitative EEG variables. More than 70,000 plausible parameter sets are finally selected and subjected to a simulated induction with the stereotypical inhaled general anesthetic isoflurane. Thereby 86 parameter sets are identified that exhibit a strong ""biphasic"" rise in total power, a feature often observed in experiments. A sensitivity study suggests that this ""biphasic"" behavior is distinguishable even at low agent concentrations. Finally, our results are briefly compared with previous work by other groups and an outlook on future fits to experimental data is provided.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15903696/

Herein, we present the EEG recordings from these structures in patients with refractory epilepsy (RE).
Three men (ages 41-43 years) were enrolled in a clinical trial for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of MB-MTT in RE. Previous evaluations had demonstrated a low likelihood of successful response to medication or resective surgery. DBS macroelectrodes were bilaterally implanted within the MB-MTT under general anesthesia and their location checked by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We obtained a surface-depth EEG for a 2- to 4-day period, including monitoring of the cardiorespiratory and mnemonic functions.
The background pattern of EEG recorded from MB-MTT was low-amplitude (usually <25 microv for MB and <20 microv for MTT) waves with a variable combination of theta-beta rhythms. In two patients, pseudoperiodic slow spikes were unilaterally recorded with or without clinical signs. For one patient, several focal ictal discharges were recorded in the right MB without scalp EEG changes.
The analysis of our depth EEG revealed that the theta-beta pattern represents the predominant physiologic profile of MB. Paroxysmal epileptiform discharges can be observed in human MB. These data supplement those available from animal observations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15857449/

The estimation of bicoherence allows us to determine whether a given time series represents a linear random process in cases where the bicoherence is trivial, i.e., a mere constant independent of frequency. In this study, we investigated the proportion of EEG epochs with nontrivial bicoherence during surgical anesthesia with propofol and alfentanil as an indicator for the degree of nonlinearity in the EEG. We reanalyzed 90 h of EEG recorded from 20 patients undergoing abdominal surgery using the Hinich procedure, which provides a statistical test for the following hypothesis: the EEG is a linear random process. In approximately 90% of all artifact-free, stationary EEG epochs, the bicoherence was found to be zero or a mere constant. Under these conditions, the EEG can be considered as a linear random process. Our findings suggest that the spectral information in the frequency domain delivered by the EEG monitoring during anesthesia is largely contained in the power spectrum of the signal. This calls into question the benefit of EEG bispectral analysis for monitoring anesthesia effect.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15845687/
15840994,Response entropy increases during painful stimulation.,Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,2005,"Wheeler P, Hoffman WE, Baughman VL, Koenig H","Frontal electromyography (FEMG) may increase during painful stimulation and indicate patient arousal. The Datex-Ohmeda Entropy Module calculates state entropy (SE) of the electroencephalogram (EEG; 0.8-32 Hz) and response entropy (RE) of EEG and FEMG (0.8-47 Hz). We determined whether RE increases above SE (RE--SE), an indication of FEMG, increase during painful stimuli and if this is related to paralysis or level of anesthesia. With the unanesthetized baseline measurement, SE was 89 +/- 2 and RE was 98 +/- 2. During paralysis and anesthesia with either 0.8% (n = 10) or 1.4% (n = 10) isoflurane, SE decreased to 63 +/- 7 and 34 +/- 14, respectively, and the RE--SE difference decreased 90%. Before recovery from paralysis, arterial catheter or head pin placement increased RE--SE above unanesthetized levels in eight patients (five treated with 0.8% and three with 1.4% isoflurane), consistent with an increase in FEMG. The elevated RE--SE difference was related to a significant increase in SE, blood pressure, and heart rate. After recovery from paralysis, tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve increased the RE--SE difference above unanesthetized levels in 8 of 20 patients (6 treated with 0.8% and 2 with 1.4% isoflurane). In these patients, SE increased significantly. The remaining 12 patients did not show an increase in RE--SE during tetanic stimulation and SE did not increase. We conclude that increased RE during painful stimulation was not dependent on recovery from paralysis but was seen more often in patients anesthetized with 0.8% compared with 1.4% isoflurane. This suggests that RE reflects FEMG and may be useful to identify inadequate anesthesia and patient arousal during painful stimuli.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15840994/

All drugs were intravenously infused over 30 minutes. Plasma adinazolam, NDMAD, and alprazolam concentrations, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the beta (12-30 Hz) range, performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and subjective measures of mood and sedation were monitored for 12 to 24 hours. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for adinazolam, NDMAD, and alprazolam, respectively, were as follows: volume of distribution (L), 106, 100, and 77; elimination half-life (hours), 2.9, 2.8, and 14.6; and clearance (mL/min), 444, 321, and 84. More than 80% of the total infused adinazolam dose was converted to systemically appearing NDMAD. All 3 benzodiazepine agonists significantly increased beta EEG activity, with alprazolam showing the strongest agonist activity and adinazolam showing the weakest activity. Alprazolam and NDMAD significantly decreased DSST performance, whereas adinazolam had no effect relative to placebo. Adinazolam, NDMAD, and alprazolam all produced significant observer-rated sedation. Plots of EEG effect versus plasma alprazolam concentration demonstrated counterclockwise hysteresis, consistent with an effect site delay. This was incorporated into a kinetic-dynamic model in which hypothetical effect site concentration was related to pharmacodynamic EEG effect via the sigmoid E(max) model, yielding an effect site equilibration half-life of 4.8 minutes. The exponential effect model described NDMAD pharmacokinetics and EEG pharmacodynamics. The relation of both alprazolam and NDMAD plasma concentrations to DSST performance could be described by a modified exponential model. Pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling was not possible for adinazolam, as the data did not conform to any known concentration-effect model. Collectively, these results indicate that the benzodiazepine-like effects occurring after adinazolam administration are mediated by mainly NDMAD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15831776/

Immediately after intubation remifentanil was reduced to a constant rate of 0.2 microg kg(-1) min(-1) whereas a propofol infusion was now started at 3 mg kg(-1) h(-1) and then adjusted accordingly to achieve a target Narcotrend stages of D(0-2) indicating general anaesthesia. At the end of surgery the propofol and remifentanil infusions were stopped without tapering, the time to unstimulated opening of eyes was determined, and the propofol consumption (given as mg kg(-1) h(-1)) was calculated from the total amount of infused propofol but without the induction bolus, from the actual body weight and the duration of propofol infusion. Furthermore, a linear regression analysis was applied for propofol consumption vs. age.
The ages of the patients studied ranged from 16 to 83 yr old and patients were classified as ASA I-III. Propofol consumption significantly decreased with the patients' age: 30 yr of age or below the propofol consumption was calculated as 5.9 +/- 1.7 mg kg(-1) h(-1), for 31-50 yr as 5.4 +/- 1.8 mg kg(-1) h(-1), for 51-70 yr as 4.5 +/- 1.7 mg kg(-1) h(-1) and above 70 yr as 3.5 +/- 1.4 mg kg(-1) h(-1). Linear regression analysis revealed propofol (mg kg(-1) h(-1)) = 9.136 - (0.0597 x age (yr)); R = 0.53. Concomitantly, the recovery time to opening of eyes increased with the patients' age: < or = 30 yr, 7.4 +/- 3.7 min; 31-50 yr, 9.5 +/- 4.0 min; 51-70 yr, 9.8 +/- 4.1 min; and > or = 71 yr, 14.9 +/- 12.1 min.
We conclude that with Narcotrend guidance, mean propofol consumption and recovery times are age dependent. However, as a result of large inter-individual variability, age per se does not allow a prediction of individual propofol need or recovery time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15816591/

We therefore measured EEG-power spectra in the beta, alpha, Theta, and delta-band in 36 patients undergoing ROD. Measurements were taken before, during steady-state anesthesia and following administration of the antagonist naltrexone. In addition, the non-specific NMDA-antagonist S+ ketamine was given for reduction of CNS-hyperexcitation, while the efficacy of this adjunct was determined using EEG power spectra analysis. Compared to steady-state anesthesia, EEG power spectra were characterized by a marked decrease of power by 251% in the delta (0.5-3 Hz) and an increase by 209% in the beta- (13-30 Hz) domain when withdrawal was induced with naltrexone. Subsequent administration of S+-ketamine induced a reversal of acute abstinence-related EEG power changes: compared to anesthesia with naltrexone on board, power in the EEG increased by 65% in the delta- and decreased by 723% in the beta-band. While sympathetically induced hemodynamic alterations in anesthesia-assisted opioid detoxification can be attenuated by the alpha2-agonist clonidine and sedation, central nervous sensory activation can be attenuated by the administration of S+-ketamine (1.5 mg/kg). Since EEG alterations during acute withdrawal with naltrexone can be controlled by the non-specific NMDA-antagonist S+-ketamine, this latter presents a useful adjunct during ROD management.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15808965/

Previous research comparing the effect of the barbiturate anesthetics methohexital and thiopental on seizure duration has yielded conflicting results. A recent period of unavailability of methohexital in the United States allowed for retrospective comparison of seizure length as well as clinical improvement in treatment using each agent. Retrospective review was made of 837 treatments administered to 97 patients between January 2, 2002, and May 31, 2003, examining anesthetic, seizure duration, and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores of inpatients at hospital admission and discharge. Analysis of variance of treatments 2-5 showed no significant effect for anesthetic on seizure duration. Analysis on a treatment-by-treatment basis revealed a marginally significant trend toward shorter EEG seizures in the thiopental group at the second treatment (50.5 +/- 23.6 s vs. 61.1 +/- 27.9 s; P = 0.07) and fifth treatment (41.7 +/- 16.9 s vs. 51.8 +/- 24.0 s; P = 0.07). A difference approaching statistical significance revealed shorter convulsion length in the thiopental group at treatment 5 (29.0 +/- 12.3 s vs. 34.8 +/- 12.3 s; P = 0.07). Comparison of GAF score improvement at hospital discharge revealed no significant difference (GAF increase 26.4 +/- 9.4 for methohexital-treated patients vs. 24.8 +/- 12.0 for thiopental-treated patients; t = 1.00, df = 82, P > 0.1). Trends approaching significance in treatments 2 and 5 revealed shorter seizures in the thiopental group. However, data on clinical recovery reveals no greater improvement in the methohexital group. Thus, this study calls further into question the premise that choice of barbiturate anesthetic may affect clinical efficacy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15791172/

Hemodynamic stability and lack of respiratory irritation have justified its rapid extension to pediatric inhalation induction. The epileptogenic potential of sevoflurane has been suspected since the first case reports of abnormal movements in children without a history of epilepsy. The objectives of this short review are to: (i) analyze clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) features supporting epileptogenic activity of sevoflurane, (ii) identify factors which may modulate that activity, and (iii) suggest guidelines of clinical practice to limit expression of this epileptiform phenomenon, which has thus far unknown morbidity. The use of sevoflurane may be associated with cortical epileptiform EEG signs, usually without clinical manifestation. No lasting neurological or EEG sequelae have been described thus far, and the potential morbidity of this epileptogenic effect is unknown. The use of sevoflurane in children, with its remarkable cardiovascular profile, should include a number of precautions. Among them, the limitation of the depth of anesthesia is essential. The wide use of cerebral function monitoring (the most simple being the EEG), may permit optimization of sevoflurane dose and avoidance of burst suppression and major epileptiform signs in fragile subjects, notably the very young and the very old.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15787916/

Clinical experience indicates that Narcotrend monitoring (MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany, version 4.0) excludes more EEG epochs because of artefacts than bispectral index monitoring (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA, version XP). Whether this increased exclusion of epochs is justified has not been investigated yet.
Eighteen adult patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were investigated. Induction of anaesthesia was performed with a fentanyl bolus and a propofol infusion. Additionally, following intubation patients received 15 ml bupivacaine 0.5% epidurally. After a waiting period of 45 min depth of anaesthesia was varied two times by increasing and decreasing propofol concentrations. Narcotrend index, BIS values and calculated propofol effect site concentrations were automatically recorded at intervals of 5 s. We tested the hypothesis whether exclusion of artefacts detected by the Narcotrend monitor would possibly improve the prediction probability of the BIS monitor, justifying the necessity of artefact suppression.
Simulated propofol effect site concentrations ranged from 2 microg/ml to 6 microg/ml. The Narcotrend monitor excluded a significantly higher percentage of epochs because of artefact detection (12.6 + 1.0%) than the BIS monitor (0.4 +/- 0.1%). The performance of BIS as an indicator of predicted propofol effect site concentrations did not differ when including (P(K) = 0.86 +/- 0.05) or excluding (P(K) = 0.85 +/- 0.04) the data pairs where Narcotrend monitor but not BIS monitor indicated an artefact. Artefacts were evenly distributed over the investigated range ofpropofol effect site concentrations.
Exclusion of data pairs that were detected as artefacts by Narcotrend but not by BIS did not change the performance of bispectral index as an indicator of propofol effect site concentration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15779840/

Three induction schemes were studied with 10 patients each receiving 2 mg propofol/kg/60s (group 1), 4 mg/kg/120s (group 2), and 4 mg/kg/240s (group 3). The EEG was recorded with the EEG monitor Narcotrend. To analyse the relation between drug effect and EEG parameters, Spearman rank correlation of the different EEG parameters with the calculated propofol effect-site concentration was computed.
In all groups Narcotrend Index showed the highest correlation with the propofol effect-site concentration and the lowest variability of individual correlation values. Furthermore, only the Narcotrend Index showed a monophasic behaviour over the entire time period analysed. In the group of entropy parameters approximate entropy yielded the best results. Among the spectral parameters the burst-compensated 95% spectral edge frequency had the highest correlation with the propofol effect-site concentration. It was markedly higher than for the standard spectral edge frequency. The correlations of median frequency and amplitude entropy with propofol effect-site concentration were the lowest. CONCLUSIONS. Changes in the propofol effect-site concentration during induction of anaesthesia were best described by the multivariate Narcotrend Index compared to conventional spectral EEG parameters and different entropy measures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15779834/

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is believed to be one of the useful forms of monitoring cerebrovascular insufficiency during CEA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring, a processed EEG parameter, for the reliable detection of intraoperative cerebral ischaemia during awake CEA.
We monitored 52 patients continuously with the BIS monitor together with assessment of neurological function (contralateral upper and lower limb strength and the verbal component of the Glasgow Coma Scale for speech) in patients undergoing awake CEA.
Overall mean BIS value in all patients was 96 (SD 2.9). In five patients who showed clinical evidence of cortical ischaemia during carotid cross-clamping, there was no change in the original range of BIS values throughout the procedure (96.7 [3.2]). In one patient BIS values decreased to 38 about 5 min after the incision and recovered within the next 10 min. The mean BIS value in the remaining 46 patients who did not develop clinical signs of ischaemia was 95.4 (2.6). Three cases are presented which demonstrate the inability of the BIS monitor to detect cerebral ischaemia.
Lack of correlation of BIS with the signs of cerebral ischaemia during CEA makes it unreliable for detection of cerebrovascular insufficiency. We conclude that awake neurological testing is the preferred method of monitoring in these patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15778269/

Magnesium is an attractive anti-shivering agent because it is used for treatment of postoperative shivering and provides protection against ischaemic injury in animal models. We tested the hypothesis that magnesium reduces the threshold (triggering core temperature) and gain of shivering without substantial sedation or muscle weakness.
We studied nine healthy male volunteers (18-40 yr) on two randomly assigned treatment days: (1) control and (2) magnesium (80 mg kg(-1) followed by infusion at 2 g h(-1)). Lactated Ringer's solution (4 degrees C) was infused via a central venous catheter over a period of approximately 2 h to decrease tympanic membrane temperature by approximately 1.5 degrees C h(-1). A significant and persistent increase in oxygen consumption identified the threshold. The gain of shivering was determined by the slope of oxygen consumption vs core temperature regression. Sedation was evaluated using a verbal rating score (VRS) from 0 to 10 and bispectral index (BIS) of the EEG. Peripheral muscle strength was evaluated using dynamometry and spirometry. Data were analysed using repeated measures anova; P<0.05 was statistically significant.
Magnesium reduced the shivering threshold (36.3 [SD 0.4] degrees C vs 36.6 [0.3] degrees C, P = 0.040). It did not affect the gain of shivering (control, 437 [289] ml min(-1) degrees C(-1); magnesium, 573 [370] ml min(-1) degrees C(-1); P=0.344). The magnesium bolus did not produce significant sedation or appreciably reduce muscle strength.
Magnesium significantly reduced the shivering threshold. However, in view of the modest absolute reduction, this finding is considered to be clinically unimportant for induction of therapeutic hypothermia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15749735/

VF initially caused a considerable suppression and slowing of the EEG. The recovery of cerebral function was evaluated by recording both EEG and auditory event related potentials (ERPs). Six hours after the episode of VF, when the patient was asleep but arousable to voice command, the N100 component of the auditory ERPs had recovered to the level measured before the operation, whereas the EEG was still very slow for that level of sedation. This may have been due to VF having less effect on the N100 component than on the background EEG.

To assess the nature of this phenomenon, patients in a surgical ICU following ventilatory support and sedation with an opioid/hypnotic/sedative were studied.
Following sufentanil/midazolam (group 1; n =14) or sufentanil/propofol (group 2; n =15) sedation, patients were evaluated for changes in mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate, the activity of the central nervous system (sensory evoked potentials, spectral edge frequency of EEG), and the endogenous opioids plasma concentrations (beta-endorphin, met-enkephalin). Data obtained were correlated with the individual intensities of withdrawal symptoms 6-, 12-, and 24 h following sedation.
Following a mean duration of ventilation of 7.7 days (+/-3.6 SD) in groups 1 and 3.5 (+/-1.7 SD) in group 2, withdrawal intensities peaked within the 6th hour after cessation. Plasma beta-endorphin and met-enkephalin levels were low during sedation, and only the sufentanil/midazolam group demonstrated a postinhibitory overshoot. Withdrawal symptom intensities demonstrated an inverse correlation with beta-endorphin and met-enkephalin levels, a direct linear correlation with amplitude height of the evoked potential, and blood pressure and heart rate changes. Withdrawal intensities did not correlate with EEG power spectral edge frequency.
The endorphinergic system is suppressed when a potent exogenous opioid like sufentanil is given over a long period of time. Following sedation, abstinence symptoms seem to be related to postinhibitory increased endorphin synthesis. This is mostly seen in the combination of sufentanil/midazolam. In addition, an increase in the amplitude of the sensory-evoked potential suggests a postinhibitory excitatory state within the nociceptive system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15714323/
15707344,New anesthesia techniques.,Thoracic surgery clinics,2005,Tung A,"Advances in anesthesia involve refinements in understanding, technique, and technology. These refinements have led to better control of the anesthetic state, effective anesthesia for a wider variety of situations, and the ability to bring sicker patients to the operating room. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the general anesthetic state are unknown, evidence suggests a specific, receptor-based effect. This concept has allowed anesthesiologists to treat anesthetic end points of immobility, lack of awareness, and autonomic control separately. It is likely that anesthesia and naturally occurring sleep interact physiologically. New, processed EEG monitors may allow anesthesiologists to titrate more finely anesthetic dose, with possible benefits in terms of speed of recovery and detection of intraoperative awareness. Since the 1990s, new anesthetic drugs (propofol, desflurane/sevoflurane, cisatracurium) have enhanced greatly control of the anesthetic state. The new intravenous anesthetic agent dexmedetomidine offers sedation with preserved respiration and cognitive function. Although its role has yet to be defined fully, it currently plays a role in ICU sedation and monitored anesthesia care. New anesthesia ventilators have better monitoring and better flow delivery at high airway pressures. These improvements significantly narrow the performance gap between anesthesia and ICU ventilators. In patients with COPD, pulmonary hypertension, or severe hypoxemia, heliox may improve gas flow, and NO may reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and improve oxygenation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15707344/

Two-hundred and 59 patients who underwent CEA, at the Ospedali Riuniti of Reggio Calabria in the period 2000-2001, were enrolled in this study. For analysis purposes, patients were divided into 4 groups, according to their neurological status and to the type of anesthesia. LA was induced either by deep and superficial cervical plexus block (side approach according to Moore). GA was induced with propofol and maintained with sevoflurane. Monitoring of the neurological status was achieved by simple clinical evaluation of the state of consciousness under LA, and by continuous EEG under GA.
With LA, a reduction in the duration of intervention and hospital stay, in the number of neurological complications and consequent intraoperative shunts was observed, and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was never required. With GA better blood pressure control was achieved, but more intraoperative shunts and admissions to ICU were required, thus increasing overall costs.
In our experience, LA seems to be the approach of choice for CEA because 1) by preserving the state of consciousness, it allows a simple clinical monitoring of cerebral perfusion maintenance; 2) it reduces the number of intraoperative shunts and the risk of admission to the ICU; 3) it is cost-effective.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15699913/

However, this approach is prone to error. Inadequate monitoring of sedation and analgesia may contribute to adverse outcomes and complications. With this in mind, data obtained continuously using nonstimulating methods such as bispectral index (BIS) may have benefits in comparison with clinical monitoring of sedation. The aim of this prospective observational trial was to evaluate the use of electroencephalographic (EEG) BIS for monitoring sedation in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients.
Forty paediatric patients (<18 years) were sedated for mechanical ventilation in a cardiac surgical and general PICU. In each paediatric patient BIS and COMFORT score were obtained. The study protocol did not influence ongoing PICU therapy. BIS and corresponding COMFORT score were collected three times for each patient. Measurements with the best starting EEG impedances were analyzed further. Deep sedation was defined as a COMFORT score between 8 and 16, and light sedation as a score between 17 and 26. Biometric and physiological data, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality III scores were also recorded.
There was a good correlation (Spearman's rho 0.651; P = 0.001) between BIS and COMFORT score in the presence of deep sedation and low starting impedance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed best discrimination between deep and light sedation at a BIS level of 83.

Connectivity within the mediotemporal lobe (MTL), and in particular rhinal-hippocampal synchronization within the gamma band, has been shown to be crucial for declarative memory formation. Thus, we analyzed EEG recordings obtained from the scalp, as well as directly from within the hippocampus and from the anterior parahippocampal gyrus, which is covered by rhinal cortex, in patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy during propofol anesthesia, which preceded electrode explantation. For the gamma band a power decrease starting with induction of anesthesia was observed at scalp position Cz, but a power increase was detected at MTL locations. In contrast to prior results for sleep recordings, rhinal-hippocampal coherence did not decrease within the gamma band at deeper levels of anesthesia. These findings may represent an indirect electrophysiological correlate of partially intact declarative memory formation during deep propofol sedation. Furthermore, we investigated how well the plasma propofol level, as well as different stages of anesthesia including the burst suppression phase, could be monitored by different spectral as well as by nonlinear EEG measures. We observed that conventional spectral power measures, most prominently those recorded from mediotemporal locations, are most closely correlated with the plasma propofol level, whereas different stages of anesthesia can be distinguished best by nonconventional spectral as well as nonlinear measures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15685392/

The Entropy algorithm quantifies the degree of disorder in the EEG. During anaesthesia the disorder of the EEG, or entropy, falls. Entropy is independent of absolute frequency or amplitude of the EEG. This may make it suitable for paediatric anaesthesia. In this prospective observational blinded study we recorded the Entropy and Bispectral Index in 23 children undergoing general anaesthesia with isoflurane and nitrous oxide, supplemented with peripheral nerve blockade. We recorded Entropy at several times during anaesthesia, pre-awakening and 1-minute post-awakening. Entropy pre-awakening and 1 minute after awakening was compared to a value during anaesthesia in three age groups; less than one-year-old (infants), one to five years (toddlers) and five to twelve years (children). The correlation between BIS and Entropy was also calculated. Entropy post-awakening was higher than during anaesthesia for all age groups. Entropy pre-awakening was higher than during anaesthesia for the children and toddlers. This was not as apparent in infants. There was a strong correlation between BIS and Entropy for children and toddlers. The correlation was less for infants. This study demonstrates that, in children, Entropy is lower during anaesthesia when compared to awake values.

Application to intracerebral EEG in temporal lobe epilepsy.,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,2005,"Bourien J, Bartolomei F, Bellanger JJ, Gavaret M, Chauvel P, Wendling F","We present a novel quantitative method to statistically analyze the distribution of multichannel intracerebral interictal spikes (multi-IIS) in stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) recordings. The method automatically extracts groups of brain structures conjointly and frequently involved in the generation of interictal activity. These groups are referred to as 'subsets of co-activated structures' (SCAS). We applied the method to long duration interictal recordings in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and analyzed the reproducibility of subsets of structures involved in the generation of multi-IIS for each patient and among patients.
Fifteen patients underwent long-term intracerebral EEG recording (SEEG technique) using depth electrodes. A 1 h period of continuous interictal EEG recording was selected for each patient with precautions regarding the time after anesthesia pre-SEEG, the temporal distance with respect to seizures, the vigilance state of the patient, and the anti-epileptic drug withdrawal. A research of SCAS was conducted on each recording using the developed method that includes 3 steps: (i) automatic detection of monochannel intracerebral interictal spikes (mono-IIS), (ii) formation of multi-IIS using a temporal sliding window, and (iii) extraction of SCAS. In the third step, statistical tests are used to evaluate the frequency of multi-IIS as well as their significance (with respect to the 'random distribution of mono-IIS' case).
In each patient, several thousands of multi-IIS (mean+/-SD, 3322+/-2190) were formed and several SCAS (mean+/-SD, 3.80+/-1.47) were automatically extracted. Results show that reproducible subsets of brain structures are involved in the generation of interictal activity. Although SCAS were found to be variable from one patient to another, some invariant information was pointed up. In all patients, multi-IIS distribute over two distinct groups of structures: mesial structures (15/15) and lateral structures (7/15). Moreover, two particular structures, the internal temporal pole and the temporo-basal cortex, may be conjointly involved with either the first or the second group. Finally, some extracted SCAS seem to match well-defined anatomo-functional circuits of the temporal lobe.
During interictal activity in MTLE, similar subsets of temporal lobe structures are involved in the generation of spikes. This paper brings statistical evidence for the existence of these subsets and presents a method to automatically extract them from SEEG recordings. Interictal activity is spatially organized in the temporal lobe and preferentially involves two functional systems of the temporal lobe (either mesial or lateral).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15661121/

Depth of sedation was subjectively assessed with the Ramsay Sedation Score. The aepEX was recorded using an auditory evoked potentials system. The bispectral index and SEF95% were measured using an Aspect A-1000 monitor.
The aepEX, bispectral index, and SEF95% correlated with the Ramsay Sedation Score, the Pk value being greatest for the aepEX, followed by the bispectral index. All three variables could predict opening of the eyes in response to verbal commands or a glabellar tap, the aepEX being a better predictor than the bispectral index or SEF95%. All three EEG variables had Pk values >0.5 in predicting coughing or movement in response to tracheal suction, but they were unable to predict increases in heart rate or systolic blood pressure.
The aepEX was the best predictor, followed by bispectral index. Although in most intensive care patients subjective sedation scales are sufficient to assess levels of sedation, the aepEX and bispectral index were potential alternatives to subjective scales when they do not work well in the setting of neuromuscular blockade or may not be sufficiently sensitive to evaluate very deep sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15650862/

Our objective was to determine the degree of agreement between sedation scales and BIS values in pediatric patients undergoing sedation.
Patients ages 2 to 17 years, undergoing procedural sedation, were enrolled. Sedation was performed in the customary manner with the addition of BIS monitoring and assessment of a clinical sedation scale: the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S), every 5 minutes during the sedation procedure. Clinical scales were performed by an investigator blinded to the BIS index. The association between a clinical scale and BIS scores was analyzed using longitudinal regression analysis.
We enrolled 47 subjects; 55% were sedated with ketamine and midazolam and the remaining 45% received methohexital, propofol or midazolam and a narcotic. The results of the regression analysis demonstrated a highly significant association between the OAA/S score and BIS value (beta = 5.0, 95% CI 4.3 to 5.7, P < 0.0001). Patients were divided into 2 groups, those sedated with ketamine and those sedated with nonketamine medications. The association between OAA/S score and BIS value was not statistically significant for the ketamine population (beta = 0.809, 95% CI -0.1 to 1.7, P = 0.09), but remained significant for the nonketamine subjects (beta = 8.6, 95% CI 7.7 to 9.4, P < 0.0001).
The OAA/S sedation scale predicts the BIS value for pediatric patients undergoing procedural sedation when sedated with certain medications, excluding ketamine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15643316/

Nonconvulsive seizures (NCSzs) are more common than previously recognized and are associated with worse outcome. The majority of seizures in ICU patients are nonconvulsive and will be missed without CEEG. Factors associated with an increased risk for NCSzs include coma, prior clinical seizures, CNS infection, brain tumor, recent neurosurgery, and periodic epileptiform discharges. In addition to detecting seizures, CEEG is also useful for characterizing paroxysmal spells such as posturing or autonomic changes, detecting ischemia, assessing level of sedation, following long-term EEG trends, and prognosticating. Most NCSzs will be detected in the first 24 hours of CEEG in noncomatose patients, but longer recording periods may be required in comatose patients or in those with periodic epileptiform discharges. EEG patterns in encephalopathic or comatose patients are often equivocal. How aggressively to treat NCSzs and equivocal EEG patterns in these patients is unclear and requires further research. Real-time detection of ischemia at a reversible stage is technologically feasible with CEEG and should be developed into a practical form for prevention of in-hospital infarction in the near future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15592007/

The perceived difference between the 2 anesthetics is smaller in patients with schizophrenia than in patients who suffer depression. In this study, propofol and etomidate were compared during the ECT of patients with schizophrenia, on the basis of their impact on seizure activity and on seizure-induced hemodynamic reactions. Schizophrenics (n = 34) who were treated with ECT participated in this randomized crossover study. Propofol (1 mg/kg) and etomidate (0.2 mg/kg) were used alternately. The 2 drugs were compared on the basis of EEG- and EMG-registered seizure duration, mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse frequency, energy index, and postictal suppression. We also analyzed the number of necessary restimulations. In case of anesthesia with etomidate, both EEG- (61.29 +/- 22.4 s, 47.9 +/- 21.3 s P = 0.014) and EMG- (46.3 +/- 23.8 s, 33.6 +/- 15.9 s P = 0.006) registered seizure durations were significantly longer than in case of propofol. When using propofol, the increase in MAP was significantly lower than when etomidate was used (8.1 +/- 10.2 mm Hg, 18.3 +/- 11.2 mm Hg, P = 0.001). There were no significant differences found in the postseizure increase in pulse frequency, in postictal suppression, or in the energy index, nor did the numbers of necessary restimulations differ significantly. Propofol was found to reduce seizure duration to a significantly greater extent than etomidate. At the same time, in electrophysiological parameters that show a correlation with clinical efficacy, there was no significant difference found between the 2 anesthetics. However, the seizure-induced increase in MAP was reduced by propofol to a significantly greater degree than by etomidate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15591855/

Patients were treated with a standard methohexital-based anesthetic. Twenty-four patients became completely or relatively refractory to maximum settings on the ECT device and were then switched to remifentanil as the sole induction agent. Seizure threshold was established by stimulus dose retitration. Stimulus dose in total charge (mC) and dynamic energy (J) was significantly lower with the remifentanil anesthetic versus methohexital. (P < 0.0001) Resulting motor and EEG seizure duration in patients was significantly longer receiving the remifentanil anesthetic versus methohexital. (P < 0.0001) Previous reports describe a rise in seizure threshold in patients for repeated ECT. Although this rise occurred during the treatment course using a methohexital anesthetic, this effect was greatly diminished when remifentanil was used as the sole anesthetic agent. We conclude that remifentanil can provide improved seizure response to ECT in patients who are refractory to seizure induction after a standard methohexital anesthetic. We also conclude that the increase in stimulus dose typically required with repeated treatments is related to the anesthetic regimen.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15591854/

Nineteen intensive care unit patients received a propofol infusion in accordance with a sedation protocol. The EEG signal and the ERPs were measured at the frontal region (Fz) and central region (Cz), both during propofol sedation and after cessation of infusion when the sedative effects had subsided. The EEG signal was subjected to power spectral estimation, and the total root mean squared power and spectral edge frequency 95% were computed. For ERPs, we used an oddball paradigm to obtain the N100 and the mismatch negativity components.
Despite considerable individual variability, the root mean squared power at Cz and Fz (P = 0.004 and P = 0.005, respectively) and the amplitude of the N100 component in response to the standard stimulus at Fz (P = 0.022) increased significantly after interruption to sedation. The amplitude of the N100 component (at Cz and Fz) was the only parameter that differed between sedation levels during propofol sedation (deep versus moderate versus light sedation: P = 0.016 and P = 0.008 for Cz and Fz, respectively). None of the computed parameters correlated with duration of propofol infusion.
Our findings suggest that use of ERPs, especially the N100 potential, may help to differentiate between levels of sedation. Thus, they may represent a useful complement to clinical sedation scales in the monitoring of sedation status over time in a heterogeneous group of neurologically intact intensive care patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15566595/

Two illustrative cases were selected from a pool of 15,000 pediatric and adult patients (ages 8-85 years) who were undergoing corrective spine surgery in operating rooms of university and community hospitals. Anesthesia was maintained with a continuous intravenous infusion of propofol (125-225 microg/kg/min) along with intermittent boluses of narcotic and midazolam (1.0-2.0 mg) as needed. Characteristic metamorphosis of the bilateral posterior tibial nerve cortical somatosensory evoked potential, highlighted by the emergence of an additional middle-latency component labeled the S-wave, served as a neurophysiological marker of ""light"" propofol anesthesia prompting elevation of propofol infusion rate or bolus injection.
The S-wave was routinely abolished with increased propofol infusion rate or bolus injection. In all instances increased propofol concentration levels produced a characteristic morphologic change in the posterior tibial nerve cortical somatosensory evoked potential consistent with a return to adequate anesthetic depth. Selected cases presented herein compare the S-wave technique to BIS and illustrate the usefulness of the S-wave in identifying inadequate depth of propofol anesthesia.
The bilateral posterior tibial nerve cortical somatosensory evoked potential changes its morphology in predictable fashion with decreased depth of propofol anesthesia, allowing for anticipation of imminent anesthetic ""lightening.""

The aim was to test whether using EEG and N100 the level of sedation may be evaluated.
Twenty-nine cardiac surgery patients were studied. The EEG signal and the N100 potential were recorded at awake one day before the cardiac operation and two times after the operation, when the clinical level of postoperative propofol sedation was considered deep (Ramsay Score 6) and moderate (Ramsay Score 4). Discriminant analysis was used to select those spectral EEG and/or N100 variables which would predict the correct level of sedation best. The final classification was based on canonical discriminant functions and Mahalanobis' distance.
The spectral EEG variables (slow/fast-ratio, delta, and beta2 powers) predicted the correct level of sedation with 81% (canonical discriminant functions) and 80% (Mahalanobis' distance) accuracy. Similarly, the N100 (amplitude, latency, and the first principal component) predicted the correct level of sedation with 91% and 92% accuracy, and the combination of the EEG and N100 with 96% and 93% accuracy.

The risk of stroke during CEA ranges from 1.1% to 7.5%. Shunting is usually advised when severe ischemia during cross-clamping of the internal carotid artery is suspected. Routine use of an intraluminal shunt may increase the perioperative stroke rate. Popular and well documented methods of neurologic monitoring for ischemia during general anesthesia are electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) of the middle cerebral artery. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare cerebral oximetry using near infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) with EEG and TCD. Preliminary data on 14 patients scheduled for elective carotid endarterectomy were included and a literature search was performed to correlate the findings. No postoperative neurologic events occurred. During carotid clamping there was a significant decrease in regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) but there was only a weak correlation with the decrease in mean Doppler flow (R = 0.74; P = 0.02) and no correlation with EEG changes (R = 0.49; P = 0.18).

The study verified the 2 previously published BIS/N2O investigations showing no correlation between N2O dosage up to 70% and BIS. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation scores (OAA/S), however, correlated well with increasing doses of N2O from approximately 35 to 70%. A near linear dose-response relationship was established between OAA/S and end tidal (ET) sevoflurane concentrations of 0.4-0.7%. Only at the highest level of end tidal sevoflurane recorded, 0.7%, was statistically significant BIS depression seen. Subjects evaluated the acceptability of the sedative effect of the 2 gases, showing a slight preference for N2O. Comparable partial anterograde amnesia and sedation (OAA/S) were produced by both agents in administered concentrations of 40-70% N2O and 0.6-0.8% sevoflurane. Female subjects exhibited better memory and significantly less amnesia than males. No statistically significant changes occurred in any of the monitored vital signs. EMG readings demonstrated a statistically significant difference from control values only at the highest, 0.7%, ET concentration of sevoflurane. BIS does not appear useful for evaluating the level of nitrous oxide sedation in the dental setting but may have some value in assessing depth of sedation at deeper levels of sevoflurane sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15384293/

Although VPA usually is well tolerated, its use in combination with other psychotropic compounds might bear an elevated risk of adverse reactions. Here, we present the case of a 42-year-old male suffering from treatment-resistant psychotic depression, who was prescribed VPA additionally to lithium, clomipramine, flupentixol and risperidone. By doing so, he developed myoclonus, tremor and encephalopathy with sedation and marked EEG background slowing. Most notably, these side effects occurred in the presence of normal VPA and ammonia serum concentrations. On VPA discontinuation, all symptoms vanished and EEG normalized. We thus suggest that direct VPA-induced encephalopathy in the absence of ammonemia does exist, in this case probably facilitated by psychotropic polypharmacy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15380868/
15377585,Awareness and the EEG power spectrum: analysis of frequencies.,British journal of anaesthesia,2004,"Dressler O, Schneider G, Stockmanns G, Kochs EF","Power spectral analysis is a well-established method for the analysis of EEG signals. Spectral parameters can be used to quantify pharmacological effects of anaesthetics on the brain and the level of sedation. This method, in numerous variations, has been applied to depth of anaesthesia monitoring and has been incorporated into several commercially available EEG monitors. Because of the importance of EEG spectral analysis, we evaluated the performance of each frequency in the power spectrum regarding detection of awareness.
Ninety artefact-free EEG segments of length 8 s were obtained from a database that contains perioperatively recorded EEG data. For the present analysis, EEG data were selected from 39 patients with propofol-remifentanil or sevoflurane-remifentanil anaesthesia with a period of awareness. Half of the EEG segments were recorded during periods of awareness as defined by an adequate response to the command 'squeeze my hand'. The other half were from unresponsive patients. The power spectral density was calculated for each segment. The performance of each frequency bin of the power spectrum as a detector of awareness was assessed with a remapped prediction probability rPK, i.e. the prediction probability PK mapped to a range of 0.5-1.
The remapped prediction probability was high (rPK>0.8) for low frequencies (<15 Hz) and for high frequencies (>26 Hz), with a minimum (rPK<0.55) at 21 Hz. Indentations in the 'performance spectrum' occur at the power-line frequency (50 Hz) and its harmonics and at 78 Hz, probably caused by the continuous impedance measurement of another device used in parallel. With the exception of the indentations, the remapped prediction probability of the high frequencies (>35 Hz) was >0.95.
The best performance for the detection of awareness was achieved by EEG power spectral frequencies from >35 Hz up to 127 Hz. This frequency band may be dominated by muscle activity. The frequency band between 15 and 26 Hz may be of limited value, as reflected by lower rPK values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15377585/
15366976,Safety and tolerability of treatments for allergic rhinitis in children.,Drug safety,2004,Baena-Cagnani CE,"Allergic rhinitis is a common condition in adults and children and can have a large impact on patients' health and quality of life. The aim of current allergic rhinitis therapies is to treat the subjective symptoms and to improve objective measures of the disease. Of the available treatment options for paediatric allergic rhinitis, the newer oral antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids are first-line treatments.First-generation antihistamines are associated with unwanted adverse effects such as cardiotoxicity, sedation and impairment of psychomotor function. Despite results from studies using first-generation antihistamines demonstrating impairment of cognitive and academic function in children, many of these agents are still commonly given to patients. The newer antihistamines, developed with the aim of being more specific for the histamine H(1) receptor and of overcoming these adverse effects, are the medication of choice in patients with mild intermittent allergic rhinitis. For children <12 years of age, three newer oral antihistamines are currently available: cetirizine, loratadine and fexofenadine. A lack of adverse effects with these antihistamines has been demonstrated in children using EEG and psychomotor performance tests, and in clinical studies. However, issues of receptor selectivity and the potential for CNS adverse effects still remain, and further studies are warranted.Intranasal corticosteroids are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents used for the treatment of paediatric allergic rhinitis; however, the safety of these compounds remains controversial. The safety implications associated with corticosteroids are long-term, dose-related systemic effects, such as suppression of adrenocortical function, growth and bone metabolism, and the extent of these effects is influenced by a number of factors including corticosteroid type, pharmacokinetic profile, mode of delivery and delivery device. Topical corticosteroids were introduced to reduce the systemic effects seen with the long-term use of oral agents. The intranasal corticosteroids currently available for the treatment of paediatric allergic rhinitis - beclometasone, budesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone and triamcinolone - have short half-lives and rapid first-pass hepatic metabolism; however, their pharmacokinetics vary in terms of systemic absorption, potency, binding affinity, lipophilicity, volume of distribution, and half-life. A number of studies - utilising hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function tests such as plasma cortisol levels, 24-hour urinary-free cortisol tests; stimulation tests with corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone), lypressin, and corticotropin-releasing hormone; and growth assessment studies using knemometry and stadiometry - have indicated that these intranasal corticosteroids are well-tolerated in paediatric patients and do not significantly affect growth. The wealth of clinical data and the recommendations from evidence-based guidelines suggest that both antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids have good safety profiles in children. Nevertheless, growth should be regularly monitored in children receiving intranasal corticosteroids. Other treatments such as immunotherapy, local chromones and decongestants can also be beneficial in managing paediatric allergic rhinitis, and therapies should be considered on an individual basis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15366976/

Quantifying the blink reflex may reflect the depression of reflex arches induced by anaesthetics and thus being informative on the anaesthetic state.
The relation between the electrically evoked blink reflexes and the depth of sedation and anaesthesia induced with intravenous propofol was investigated. Twenty patients received propofol by target-controlled infusion to create a stepwise deepening of sedation and anaesthesia. Depth of anaesthesia was assessed using the observer's assessment of anaesthesia and sedation (OAAS) scale, and by bispectral EEG analysis (BIS). Probit analysis was used to estimate the predicted propofol effect site concentrations producing unconsciousness, no response to noxious stimulation, and loss of blink reflex components.
Latency of the first (R1) and second (R2) blink component increased, whereas duration and area decreased with increasing depth of sedation and anaesthesia. A reasonably strong correlation between OAAS and the areas of R1 and R2 components was found (Spearman's rho = 0.92 and 0.89). The areas of R1 and R2 and the OAAS also correlated with BIS (Spearman's rho = 0.91, 0.88 and 0.90). EC(50) and EC(95) for loss of R1 were 2.8 (95% CI: 2.5-3.2) micro g/ml and 4.6 (95% CI: 4.1-5.5) micro g/ml, respectively.
Our results suggest that the differential sensitivity of the components of the blink reflex could be useful in monitoring depth of sedation and light levels of anaesthesia during the administration of propofol. Both OAAS and BIS correlate similarly with the blink reflex components.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15352965/

Linking of electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring to TCI for closed-loop anaesthesia remains a research tool, although commercial development may follow.

Three groups of 20 patients received an effect-site controlled propofol infusion (Ce(PROP)) starting at 1 microg ml(-1) and increased in steps of 0.5 microg ml(-1) at 4 min intervals. In addition, a remifentanil infusion was maintained at a group-dependent, fixed effect-site target concentration (Ce(REMI)) (0, 2 or 4 ng ml(-1)). The ability of BIS, SE or RE to predict LOR(verbal) and LOR(noxious) were compared with the changes in BIS, SE and RE using logistic regression, prediction probability (P(K)), and sensitivity/specificity.
In all groups, BIS, SE and RE decreased with increasing Ce(PROP). However, BIS decreased more smoothly than SE and RE at deeper levels of sedation. At LOR(verbal), BIS(50), SE(50) and RE(50) increased with increasing Ce(REMI). BIS, SE and RE all detected LOR(verbal) accurately but BIS performed better at 100% sensitivity. Sensitivity/specificity for detection of LOR(verbal) decreased for all methods with increasing Ce(REMI). LOR(noxious) was poorly described by all measures.
LOR(verbal) was detected accurately by BIS, SE and RE except for 100% sensitivity, where BIS performed better. Though BIS, SE and RE were influenced by remifentanil during propofol administration, their ability to detect LOR(verbal) remained accurate.

15 boys and 15 girls with a mean age of 6.4 years (range l-14 years) were included. All still suffered from seizures despite past treatment with a mean of five drugs. Nearly all were mentally retarded, 19 to a severe and 10 to a minor degree. Fifteen were ataxic and 11 hypotonic. The EEG in 23 showed irregular generalised spike-wave discharges. PET SPM analysis revealed bioccipital hypometabolism related to sedation. Pathological monofocal hypometabolic areas were found in three, multifocal hypometabolic areas in 22 and diffuse bilateral hypometabolism in three patients. Frontal hypometabolism correlated to the degree of mental retardation, hypotonia, and ataxia.

Median PRO injection rate was 4.8 mg/kg/h (range, 2.1-13), median duration of PRO treatment was 3 days (range, 1-9), and median duration of ICU stay was 7 days (range, 2-42). In 24 episodes in which the patient survived, shivering after general anesthesia was seen in 10 episodes, transient dystonia and hyperlipemia in one each, and mild neuropsychological impairment in five. The seven deaths were not directly related to PRO use.
PRO administered with CZP was effective in controlling most of RSE episodes, without major adverse effects. In this setting, PRO may therefore represent a valuable alternative to barbiturates. A randomized trial with these drug classes could definitively assess their respective role in RSE treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15230698/
15185808,Bispectral Index System (BIS) monitoring reduces time to discharge in children requiring intramuscular sedation and general anesthesia for outpatient dental rehabilitation.,Pediatric dentistry,2004,"Messieha ZS, Ananda RC, Hoffman WE, Punwani IC, Koenig HM","Pediatric patients who receive both intramuscular (i.m.) sedation and general anesthesia (GA) for oral rehabilitation occasionally experience prolonged sedation and delayed discharge. The Bispectral Index System (BIS) is an EEG monitor that measures the level of sedation. The authors compared discharge times of patients who had BIS monitoring to those who did not to determine if the use of BIS speeded discharge.
After IRB approval, 20 children were enrolled. BIS was monitored continuously from admission until discharge. Each child received ketamine, midazolam, and glycopyrrolate i.m. Once sedated, the patient was transferred to the operating room, monitored, and i.v. access was established. GA proceeded with sevoflurane, rocuronium, and fentanyl. Randomly, in half the patients, the anesthesiologist knew and maintained the BIS at GA level of sedation by adjusting sevoflurane. In the rest, the anesthesiologist did not know BIS. Time from turning of sevoflurane to discharge was noted and compared.
Patients where the BIS was known and used were discharged 60+/-13 minutes after the end of GA. Patients where BIS was unknown were discharged 90+/-11 minutes after the end of GA (P<.001).
Based on the data, the authors recommend the use of BIS to facilitate faster discharge of pediatric patients who require i.m. sedation and GA for oral rehabilitation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15185808/

Recent studies suggest that ""generalized"" seizures may not involve the whole brain homogeneously. For example, electrophysiological recordings in WAG/Rij rats, an established model of human absence seizures, have shown that spike-and-wave discharges are most intense in the perioral somatosensory cortex and thalamus, but spare the occipital cortex. Is this heterogeneous increased neuronal activity matched by changes in local cerebral blood flow sufficient to meet or exceed cerebral oxygen consumption? To investigate this, we performed blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements at 7T with simultaneous electroencephalogram recordings. During spontaneous spike-wave seizures in WAG/Rij rats under fentanylhaloperidol anesthesia, we found increased fMRI signals in focal regions including the perioral somatosensory cortex, known to be intensely involved during seizures, whereas the occipital cortex was spared. For comparison, we also studied bicuculline-induced generalized tonic-clonic seizures under the same conditions, and found fMRI increases to be larger and more widespread than during spike-and-wave seizures. These findings suggest that even in regions with intense neuronal activity during epileptic seizures, oxygen delivery exceeds metabolic needs, enabling fMRI to be used for investigation of dynamic cortical and subcortical network involvement in this disorder.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15181366/

In a three-way crossover study, 8 volunteers received midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) by constant-rate intravenous infusion. The durations of midazolam infusions for the three trials were 1 minute, 1 hour, and 3 hours. Plasma midazolam concentrations and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the 13- to 30-Hz range were monitored for 24 hours. Based on separate analysis of each subject-trial, mean values for volume of distribution and distribution or elimination half-life did not significantly vary. Central compartment volume and clearance differed among the three midazolam infusion trials; however, the magnitude of change was small. EEG activity in the 13- to 30-Hz range significantly increased for all three midazolam infusion trials. Plots of midazolam plasma concentration versus pharmacodynamic EEG effect for the 1-hour and 3-hour infusion trials did not reveal evidence of either counterclockwise or clockwise hysteresis. Plots from the 1-minute infusion trial demonstrated counterclockwise hysteresis, consistent with an equilibration effect-site delay. This was incorporated into a kinetic-dynamic model in which hypothetical effect-site concentration was related to pharmacodynamic EEG effect via the sigmoid E(max) model. Analysis of all three infusion trials together yielded the following mean estimates: maximum EEG effect, 16.3% over baseline; 50% maximum effective concentration, 31 ng/mL; and an apparent rate constant for drug disappearance from the effect compartment which approached infinity. Despite the delay in effect onset during the 1-minute midazolam infusion, midazolam infusions in duration of up to 3 hours produce CNS sedation without evidence of tolerance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15145968/
15142753,Modelling general anaesthesia as a first-order phase transition in the cortex.,Progress in biophysics and molecular biology,2004,"Steyn-Ross ML, Steyn-Ross DA, Sleigh JW","Since 1997 we have been developing a theoretical foundation for general anaesthesia. We have been able to demonstrate that the abrupt change in brain state brought on by anaesthetic drugs can be characterized as a first-order phase transition in the population-average membrane voltage of the cortical neurons. The theory predicts that, as the critical point of phase change into unconsciousness is approached, the electrical fluctuations in cortical activity will grow strongly in amplitude while slowing in frequency, becoming more correlated both in time and in space. Thus the bio-electrical change of brain-state has deep similarities with thermodynamic phase changes of classical physics. The theory further predicts the existence of a second critical point, hysteretically separated from the first, corresponding to the return path from comatose unconsciousness back to normal responsiveness. There is a steadily accumulating body of clinical evidence in support of all of the phase-transition predictions: low-frequency power surge in EEG activity; increased correlation time and correlation length in EEG fluctuations; hysteresis separation, with respect to drug concentration, between the point of induction and the point of emergence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15142753/

A prospective, blinded, observational cohort study.
124 mechanically ventilated, adult, medical ICU patients.
Using BIS 3.4 and BIS-XP 4.0 algorithms, BIS values were calculated immediately prior to clinical assessments. The clinical assessments included the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and presence or absence of delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. A total of 484 assessments were collected among 124 patients. BIS-XP values demonstrated greater correlation with RASS than BIS 3.4 ( R(2)=0.36 vs. 0.20), although considerable overlap of BIS-XP scores remained across RASS levels. Median BIS-XP values for delirious and nondelirious observations were 74 and 96, respectively, while BIS 3.4 values were 91 and 96, respectively. However, neither BIS 3.4 nor BIS-XP were significantly associated with delirium after controlling for RASS value.

Sedation is discussed as a relevant side-effect, mostly based on data recorded in normal subjects without pain. The aim of this study was to quantify and to evaluate electrophysiologically the analgesic and sedative effects of morphine for the first time using an experimental pain model.
Analgesic and sedative effects of a low dose of morphine sulfate (CAS 6211-15-0; 10 mg i.v.) were determined using a standard phasic pain model (intracutaneously administered electrical pulses) in a placebo-controlled design with seven healthy subjects. Five blocks (1 block = 80 stimuli) of painful stimuli were applied, covering a period of 3 h. Analgesia was assessed by subjective pain ratings and by pain-related brain potentials. Sedation was determined by the power spectra of the spontaneous EEG, by auditory evoked potentials (AEP), reaction times and mood scales.
In all subjects the pain related variables were suppressed maximally 2 h after morphine administration (p < 0.01 versus placebo), indicated by a decrease of the pain ratings by about 45% and of the pain related brain potentials by about 50%. Interestingly, no effect on any sedation variable was found (p > 0.05).
The lack of sedative effects in the presence of marked analgesia was surprising in comparison with results of previous studies. It is concluded that the experimental pain increased the arousal level thus counteracting morphine-induced sedation. This may explain why other studies found relevant sedation after morphine application in the absence of pain. This underlines that sedative effects of analgesic drugs should be evaluated in the presence of pain. In relation to other analgesics (meperidine, pentacozine, nortilidine, flupirtine and tramadol) evaluated by exactly the same experimental protocol, morphine exhibited a potent analgesia with the smallest sedative effects of all.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15112860/

The Narcotrend Index had the highest average correlation with the propofol effect-site concentration and the smallest variability of the individual correlation values. Moreover, the Narcotrend Index was the only parameter which showed a monophasic trend over the whole investigated time period.

Ninety females scheduled for mastectomy were divided into three groups. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl to insert a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and was maintained by adding nitrous oxide. EEG was monitored by either BIS, spectral edge frequency by pEEG, or A-AEP index by A-AEP. We recorded the number of patients with impedance low enough to extract good EEG signals at the first electrodes application (success rate), the number with an index outside of the range considered appropriate for general anesthesia (inappropriateness rate), changes of the index by LMA insertion or surgical incision (responsiveness), and time to return to good EEG signals after signal disturbance by electric cautery (recovery time). The success rate was larger in BIS > or = A-AEP > pEEG. The inappropriateness rate was smaller in A-AEP < or = BIS , or = pEEG. The A-AEP group showed the largest responsiveness. The recovery time was shorter in pEEG < A-AEP < BIS. In summary, the BIS had the largest success rate, the A-AEP had the least inappropriateness rate and the largest responsiveness, and the pEEG had the fastest recovery time.
We compared the usefulness of three electroencephalogram monitors.

However, the exact algorithm used to synthesize the parameters to BIS values is not known. The relationship between BIS and EEG parameters was evaluated during nitrous oxide/isoflurane anesthesia. Twenty patients scheduled for elective ophthalmic surgery were enrolled in the study. After EEG recording with a BIS monitor (A-1050) was begun, general anesthesia was induced and maintained with 0.5%-2% isoflurane and 66% nitrous oxide. Using software we developed, we continuously recorded BIS, spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF95), and EEG parameters such as relative beta ratio (BetaRatio), relative synchrony of fast and slow wave (SynchFastSlow), and burst suppression ratio. BetaRatio was linearly correlated with BIS (r = 0.90; P < 0.01; n = 253) at BIS more than 60. At a BIS range of 30 to 80, SynchFastSlow (r = 0.60; P < 0.01; n = 3314) and SEF95 (r = 0.75; P < 0.01; n = 3339) were linearly correlated with BIS. The correlation between BIS and SEF95 was significantly better than the correlation between BIS and SynchFastSlow (P < 0.01). At BIS less than 30, the burst suppression ratio was inversely linearly correlated with BIS (r = 0.76; P < 0.01; n = 65). At BIS less than 80, burst-compensated SEF95 was linearly correlated with BIS (r = 0.78; P < 0.01; n = 3404). In the range of BIS from 60 to 100, BIS can be calculated from BetaRatio. At surgical levels of anesthesia, BIS and SynchFastSlow (a parameter derived from bispectral analysis) or burst-compensated SEF95 (derived from power spectral analysis) are well correlated. However, our results show that SynchFastSlow has no advantage over SEF95 in calculation of BIS.

Modification of treatment parameters has been shown to affect the magnitude of these impairments, but the role of anesthetic type remains unclear. This study tested whether there is a difference in cognitive impairments immediately after ECT with propofol compared to thiopental anesthesia.
This randomized, double-blind, crossover study included 15 patients receiving right unilateral ECT for depression. Patients received propofol or thiopental on alternating ECTs up to 6 treatments. Immediate and delayed verbal memory, motor speed, reaction speed, visuospatial, and executive functions were assessed 45 minutes after each ECT. Differences were assessed with repeated measures analysis of variance.
Cognitive impairments were reduced after ECT with propofol compared to thiopental. Time to emergence was quicker and EEG seizure duration was shorter after propofol treatments. There was no significant correlation between seizure duration and neuropsychological test performance.
Our results indicate that cognitive impairments in the early recovery period after ECT are reduced with propofol compared to thiopental anesthesia. We suggest that, in addition to ECT parameters, the type of anesthetic agent should be considered to reduce cognitive impairments after ECT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15087989/

Sedation is often necessary to perform diagnostic electroencephalograms (EEGs) in these children, who are known to be difficult to sedate with current available pediatric sedating agents, including chloral hydrate. We used clonidine as a sedative agent in children with autism and PDD, and our findings are presented. In a prospective study, 27 children with autism and PDD diagnoses underwent conscious sedation for EEG recording. Informed consents were obtained, and clonidine was administered orally as a sedating agent in a dose ranging from 0.05 mg to 0.2 mg. Subjects were monitored for pulse rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation on a continuous basis by a registered nurse. Study parameters included time to induction, time to recovery, changes in vital signs, and technical quality of EEGs. Sedation was achieved in 23 of 27 patients (85%) per our sedation criteria, and this included five patients who had previously failed to be sedated with chloral hydrate. Two patients did not satisfy the sedation criteria but cooperated enough to allow acceptable EEG tracings, increasing the success rate to 93% (25/27). The mean time to achieve sedation was 58 minutes, and the mean time to recovery was 105 minutes. Two patients (0.07%) experienced an asymptomatic heart rate reduction up to 40%, which was not sustained and recovered promptly without any intervention. Two patients (0.07%) experienced systolic blood pressure reductions of 30% and 40%. They remained asymptomatic, had no changes in other cardiorespiratory parameters, and required no intervention. All EEGs were of good technical quality without any ""drug effect."" Clonidine is a viable alternative for sedation in children with autism and PDD. It is well tolerated without any significant side effects and is efficacious in children with autism and PDD. The advantages of clonidine include ease of administration, shorter duration of total sedation, lack of EEG drug effect, and high overall success rate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15083132/

In 23 ASA I-II patients, aged 18-65 yr, about to have general anaesthesia, we induced anaesthesia in steps using a target-controlled infusion of propofol. After equilibration for 8 min at each predicted propofol concentration (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 microg x ml(-1)), sedation was assessed clinically with the modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale and the Narcotrend stage was noted. The prediction performance of the Narcotrend was assessed with the prediction probability P(K). A P(K) value of 1.0 means an exact prediction on every occasion, while a P(K) of 0.5 is no better than a 50:50 chance of being correct.
In 12 women and 11 men (age 42 (sd 11) yr), a total of 138 measurements were made; 129 were analysed and nine were of poor signal quality. The prediction probability for the corresponding level of sedation was P(K)=0.92 (se 0.01); for the different target concentrations of propofol it was P(K) = 0.91 (se 0.01).

We report two clinical episodes of convulsions associated with the induction of sevoflurane anaesthesia in young children.

During the first 3 years no instructions for sleep deprivation were given, and during the second 3-year period, simple instructions were given to the patient or parents of young children to have less sleep prior to the EEG test. This was achieved by using the same sleep deprivation schedule irrespective of the age of the patient.

This study was performed to validate their performance during transition from consciousness to unconsciousness under different anesthetic agents.
Response entropy, SE [S/5 Entropy Module, M-ENTROPY (later in text: Entropy), Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium Corp., Helsinki, Finland] and BIS (BIS XP, A-2000, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) data were collected from 70 patients; 30 anesthetized with propofol 2 mg kg-1, 20 with sevoflurane inhalation, and 20 with thiopental 5 mg kg-1. Loss and regaining of consciousness (LOC, ROC) was tested every 10 s, and sensitivity, specificity, and prediction probability (Pk) were calculated. Behavior of the indices was studied.
Sensitivity, specificity, and Pk values for consciousness were high and similar for all indices. During regaining of consciousness after propofol bolus, RE, SE, and BIS values recovered by 81 +/- 22%, 75 +/- 26%, and 59 +/- 18% (mean +/- SD), respectively, from the minimum relative to their baseline. After thiopental bolus, RE, SE, and BIS values recovered by 86+/-21%, 88 +/- 13%, and 63 +/- 14%, respectively. The relative rise was higher in RE and SE compared with BIS (P < 0.01). During deep levels of hypnosis, RE and SE decreased monotonously as a function of burst suppression ratio, while BIS showed biphasic behavior.

We compared the performance of Narcotrend index and BIS as EEG measures of anesthetic drug effect during propofol anesthesia. Eighteen adult patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy were investigated. An epidural catheter was placed in the lumbar space and electrodes for BIS (version XP; Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA) and Narcotrend were positioned as recommended by the manufacturers. Narcotrend index, BIS values, and propofol plasma and effect site concentrations as parallelly simulated by Rugloop software (Department of Anesthesia, Ghent University, Belgium) were automatically recorded in intervals of 5 s. Induction of anesthesia consisted of a fentanyl bolus and a propofol infusion. After endotracheal intubation, patients received 15 mL bupivacaine 0.5% epidurally, and 45 min later propofol dosages were subsequently increased and decreased twice. Simulated propofol effect site concentrations ranged from 2.0 +/- 0.4 microg/mL (smallest) to 6.3 +/- 1.3 microg/mL (largest) during these subsequent increases and decreases of propofol. In terms of prediction probability (P(K)) the performance of the Narcotrend index (P(K) = 0.88 +/- 0.03) to predict propofol effect site concentrations was comparable to the BIS (P(K) = 0.85 +/- 0.04).

Children were allocated randomly to receive rectal midazolam 0.4 mg kg(-1) (n=20) or oral clonidine 4 microg kg(-1) (n=20) as premedication. Rapid induction of anaesthesia was achieved with inhalation of sevoflurane 8% in nitrous oxide 50%-oxygen 50%. After tracheal intubation, the children's lungs were mechanically ventilated and the inspired sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to achieve an end-tidal fraction of 2.5%. The EEG and BIS were recorded during induction until 10 min after tracheal intubation. The EEG was analysed using spectral analysis at five points: baseline, loss of eyelash reflex, 15 s before the nadir of the BIS (BIS(nadir)), when both pupils returned to the central position (immediately before intubation), and 10 min after intubation.
Agitation was observed in 12 midazolam-treated and five clonidine-treated patients (P=0.05). At baseline, EEG rhythms were slower in the clonidine group. Induction of anaesthesia was associated with similar EEG changes in the two groups, with an increase in total spectral power and a shift towards low frequencies; these changes were maximal around the end of the second minute of induction (BIS(nadir)). When the pupils had returned to the central position, fast EEG rhythms increased and BIS was higher than BIS(nadir) (P<0.05). In both groups, agitation was associated with an increase in slow EEG rhythms at BIS(nadir).
Compared with midazolam, clonidine premedication reduced agitation during sevoflurane induction. During induction with sevoflurane 8% (oxygen 50%-nitrous oxide 50%), the nadir of the BIS occurred at the end of the second minute of inhalation. Agitation was associated with a more pronounced slowing of the EEG rhythms at BIS(nadir) compared with inductions in which no agitation was observed. The BIS may not follow the depth of anaesthesia during sevoflurane induction in children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14977793/

We undertook a pilot study to try to identify correlates of propofol drug concentration, electroencephalographic (EEG) variables and observed behaviour during a stepwise reduction in propofol infusion after paediatric cardiac surgery.
This was a prospective pilot study with 10 children (5 months to 8 years) emerging from propofol anaesthesia following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients underwent a stepped wake-up from propofol anaesthesia during which the propofol infusion rate was decreased from 4 mg.kg(-1).h(-1) in 1 mg.kg(-1).h(-1) steps at 30 min intervals. EEG variables, propofol blood concentrations and clinical sedation scores (COMFORT scale) were recorded during the stepped wakeup. Analgesia was maintained with a standardized continuous infusion of fentanyl.
: Mean (SD) whole blood propofol concentrations at arousal varied considerably [973 ng.ml(-1) (SD 523 ng.ml(-1))]. The summed ratio (SR) of high frequency to low frequency bands correlated with both propofol infusion rate (R2 value=0.47) and propofol blood concentrations (R2 value=0.64). The mean SR in deeply sedated patients was significantly different from that in the 5 min prior to wakening (6.84 vs 1.55, P=0.00002). There was no relationship between COMFORT scores and SR.
In this group of patients receiving opioid analgesia and relatively high doses of propofol, sedation scores were unhelpful in predicting arousal. The SR correlated with propofol blood concentrations and clinical arousal and may have potential as a predictive tool for arousal in children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14962330/

The present study evaluated whether there is concordance between the bispectral and the patient state indices with regard to end-points measured simultaneously in patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia.
Fifty-seven patients scheduled for elective abdominal, orthopaedic (Groups 1 and 2) or cardiac surgery (Group 3) under general anaesthesia were enrolled in the study. Anaesthesia was performed using remifentanil/ sevoflurane (Group 1, 19 patients), remifentanil/propofol (Group 2, 19 patients) or sufentanil/propofol/isoflurane (Group 3, 19 patients). The bispectral and the patient state indices were simultaneously recorded. Pearson's correlation between these two indices was calculated for the complete data and each group. The percentage of bispectral index values in the recommended range for general anaesthesia (45-60) that were confirmed by levels of patient state index (25-50) was calculated and vice versa.
Overall correlation between the bispectral and the patient state indices was 0.667, 0.671 in Group 1, 0.650 in Group 2 and 0.675 in Group 3 (P < 0.01). For values of the bispectral index between 45 and 60, only 40% of corresponding patient state index values were between 25 and 50. For patient state index values of 25-50, only 50% of the corresponding bispectral index values were in the range of 45-60.
Concordance between the bispectral and patient state indices is relatively weak, whereas both are thought to reflect the same clinical target, the hypnotic component of anaesthesia.

The PSI is comprised of quantitative features of the EEG (QEEG) that display clear differences between hypnotic states, but consistency across anaesthetic agents within the state.
The PSI was constructed from a systematic investigation of a database containing QEEG extracted from the analyses of continuous 19 channel EEG recordings obtained in 176 surgical patients. Induction was accomplished with etomidate, propofol, or thiopental. Anaesthesia was maintained by isoflurane, desflurane, or sevoflurane, total i.v. anaesthesia using propofol, or nitrous oxide/narcotics. It was hypothesized that a multivariate algorithm based on such measures of brain state, would vary significantly with changes in hypnotic state.
Highly significant differences were found between mean PSI values obtained during the different anaesthetic states selected for study. The relationship between level of awareness and PSI value at different stages of anaesthetic delivery was also evaluated. Regression analysis for prediction of arousal level using PSI was found to be highly significant for the combination of all anaesthetics, and for the individual anaesthetics.
The PSI, based upon derived features of brain electrical activity in the anterior/posterior dimension, significantly co-varies with changes in state under general anaesthesia and can significantly predict the level of arousal in varying stages of anaesthetic delivery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14742326/

Studies of available monitors based on bispectral analysis or evoked auditory potentials show the complexity of the problem. We assessed a new monitor, based on the entropy of the EEG, during induction of anaesthesia with either propofol or nitrous oxide.
In an open, randomized study (two groups; n=10) of day surgical patients, we induced loss of response with incremental boluses of propofol. The other group was given propofol 30 mg and then increasing concentrations of nitrous oxide until loss of response. We measured entropy with the M-Entropy Module S/5 (Datex-Ohmeda) using forehead electrodes and recorded response entropy (RE; including frontal electromyogram) and state entropy (SE; only the cortical EEG). Values are median (range).
Baseline values were RE 98 (96-100), SE 89 (87-91) and RE 98 (96-99), SE 89 (87-91) for the propofol and nitrous oxide patients, respectively. During propofol induction, both entropy indices decreased with increasing sedation, with RE 40 (23-76) and SE 34 (17-70) at loss of response. Neither RE nor SE decreased during nitrous oxide inhalation, and at loss of response using nitrous oxide, RE and SE were unchanged at 98 (96-100) and 88 (85-91) respectively.

The BIS was created after concurrent collection of EEG and clinical data from a large number of patients anesthetized with various drugs over a prolonged period and then performing a Fourier analysis followed by a bispectral calculation. The clinical stages of anesthetic depth are very well demonstrated in etherized patients. In this study, we studied the BIS changes during various stages of ether anesthesia and quantified the hypnotic depth during the surgical stage of ether anesthesia. The values for BIS under various stages and planes of ether anesthesia were recorded in 21 patients listed for short surgical procedures. During diethyl ether anesthesia, BIS initially increased and subsequently decreased. During surgical anesthesia, a BIS value of 30 was observed.
For the first time, bispectral index (BIS) has been studied in patients being anesthetized solely with ether. Ether both causes an increase and decrease in BIS during induction and emergence. The index observed during the surgical stage of ether anesthesia is probably the correct value for the depth of hypnosis because no other volatile anesthetic can produce the true anesthetic state when used alone. This value could be taken as the value to be attained when balanced anesthesia is being practiced.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14693605/

The EEGs of 60 female patients between 22 and 85 years of age were monitored continuously during standardized induction of anaesthesia with 2 mg of propofol kg(-1)60 s(-1). The EEGs were visually assessed in 20-s epochs according to a scale from A (awake) to F (very deep hypnosis). Visual EEG classifications, spectral parameters, and induction times were compared between different age groups. Additionally, data of 546 patients included in a multicentre study with 4630 patients (EEG monitor Narcotrend, MT MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany) were analyzed with regard to age-dependent changes of propofol consumption using target-controlled infusion (TCI).
During induction, patients older than 70 years reached significantly deeper EEG stages than younger patients, needed a longer time to reach the deepest EEG stage, and needed more time until a light EEG stage was regained. In patients aged 70 years and older, the total power, mainly in deep EEG stages, was significantly smaller due to a distinctly smaller absolute power of the delta frequency band. No single spectral parameter was able to reliably distinguish all EEG stages. During the steady state of anaesthesia, older patients needed less propofol for the maintenance of a defined stage of hypnosis than younger patients.
Older patients differ from younger ones regarding the hypnotic effect of propofol and the spectral patterns in the EEG. For an efficient automatic assessment of the EEG during anaesthesia a multivariable approach accounting for age-effects is indispensable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14674970/

Forty-one consecutive adult patients requiring intubation and ventilation during intensive care therapy.
Following skin preparation with alcohol and placement of EEG electrodes, PSI was recorded while patients were ventilated and sedated with constant drug infusion rates. After 30 min, the level of sedation was measured by an assessor, who was blinded to PSI values, using the Ramsay sedation score. For analysis, the mean of PSI values measured during the last minute before clinical assessment of sedation was calculated. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis revealed significant differences between the PSI values at different levels of sedation as measured by the Ramsay score, except for the differentiation of level 5 from levels 4 and 6 (p>0.3) and level 2 from level 3, where only a trend was reached (p=0.077). The prediction probability of PSI was 0.920+/-0.037.

We tested the possibility that median nerve stimulation during EEG suppression with propofol would cause an EEG response that was consistent enough to be of use for neuromonitoring.
Eight patients were anaesthetized with propofol to allow burst suppression. Electrical stimulation of the median nerve was applied during general anaesthesia and the EEG was measured.
The EEG response to a painful stimulus had four successive components: (i) N20 and P22 potentials, reflecting activation of fast somatosensory pathways; (ii) a high-amplitude negative wave, possibly reflecting activation of the somatosensory cortex SII bilaterally; (iii) a burst (i.e. a negative slow wave with superimposed 10 Hz activity, probably reflecting an arousal mechanism); and (iv) a 13-15 Hz spindle, probably originating from the thalamus, similar to sleep spindles. These could be seen separately and in different combinations. Bursts and spindles during burst suppression were also seen without stimulation. In deepening propofol anaesthesia, spindles were seen in the continuous EEG before burst suppression was achieved. In deep anaesthesia, spindles were seen when bursts had ceased, and painful stimuli evoked sharp waves without subsequent bursts.
In addition to SSEP (somatosensory evoked potentials), three different evoked responses are noted that could be useful for clinical monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14665548/

EEG was abnormal, and showed slowed background activity with slow waves in left temporal lobe. He was treated with haloperidol, clonazepam and vasoactive medications. In spite of administered treatment, hemiballic movements reappeared occasionally. Due to increased frequency of the movements the patient was hospitalized again two years later.

Extracellular recordings were done in permanently implanted animals during the natural waking-sleep cycle. Single and dual simultaneous recordings from cortical neurons, cortical and thalamic neurons, or cortical neurons and glial cells were performed in cats under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia.
(a) The minimal substrate of SW seizures is the neocortex because such seizures may occur in thalamectomized animals, in which spindles are absent. In intact-brain animals, SW seizures are initiated in neocortex and spread to the thalamus after a few seconds. The majority of thalamocortical (TC) neurons are steadily hyperpolarized throughout the cortical SW seizures. (b) In the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (PDSs) associated with the EEG ""spike"" of SW/PSW complexes contain an important inhibitory component, whereas the hyperpolarization during the EEG ""wave"" component is not due to gamma-aminobutryic acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) but is ascribed to a mixture of disfacilitation and K+ currents. As is also the case with seizures consisting of pure SW complexes, the majority of TC neurons are hyperpolarized during the cortical paroxysms and disinhibited after the cessation of cortical seizures.
Seizures with SW complexes and of the Lennox-Gastaut type preferentially evolve from sleep oscillations. They are initiated in neocortex and spread to the thalamus after a few seconds. The majority of TC neurons are inhibited during these seizures.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14641557/

In the majority of publications this has been done using the so called Bispectral (BIS) Index. The exact relation of this index to bispectral quantities like the bispectrum and its normalized version the bicoherence has not yet been published. In case the EEG is a linear random process the bicoherence is trivial. It is a mere constant independent of the EEG frequency. If the signal is a linear Gaussian random process this constant is zero. In this case both the bispectrum and bicoherence are zero. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of EEG epochs with non-trivial bicoherence during anesthesia with isoflurane/nitrous oxide.
We reanalyzed 26.4 hr of EEG signal recorded in 8 patients during anesthesia for general abdominal surgery which were stored in digitized form on CD-Rom. The test developed by Hinich for Gaussianity and linearity was applied to these data. The test was validated with various kinds of surrogate data; especially the phase randomized (pr) EEG, synthetic Gaussian random data and the z-component of the Lorenz attractor and its pr version.
The proportion of epochs for which a non-trivial bicoherence was detected by the test was as follows: Lorenz data 95%, pr Lorenz data 5%, synthetic Gaussian data 13.8%, pr EEG 5.4%, original EEG 6.2%.
As expected the test procedure correctly identified for the Lorenz data for 95% of all epochs a non-trivial bicoherence. For the original EEG data we could not find a significant greater percentage of epochs with non-trivial bicoherence than for the pr data and the synthetic Gaussian data. We conclude that the EEG during anesthesia with isoflurane/alfentanil appears to be largely a linear random process.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14650640/

The surgical procedure includes inserting the cochlear implant electrode array into the cochlea and embedding the corresponding signal receiver in the mastoid bone behind the ear. Postoperative fitting of the externally worn speech processor is very important for successful use of the cochlear implant. For this purpose, electrically elicited stapedius reflex threshold values can be used. However, stapedius reflex threshold values measured intraoperatively are influenced by anaesthetics. The goal of this retrospective study was to find out whether electroencephalogram (EEG) control of anaesthesia produces more reliable reflex threshold values as a basis for the fitting of the speech processor.
Three groups of children, after surgery for cochlear implantation, were analysed with regard to the magnitude of intraoperative electrically elicited stapedius reflex threshold values and their deviations from postoperatively determined maximum comfortable levels (group 1: methohexital/remifentanil with EEG monitoring, n = 10; group 2: isoflurane/fentanyl with EEG monitoring, n = 9; group 3: isoflurane/fentanyl without EEG monitoring, n = 11).
Children with EEG monitoring had significantly lower electrically elicited stapedius reflex threshold values and also significantly lower differences between intraoperative stapedius reflex threshold values and postoperatively determined maximum comfortable levels.
Electroencephalogram monitoring in cochlear implantation is of considerable value in controlling anaesthesia and improving speech processor fitting based on more reliable intraoperative neurophysiological data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14617120/

Over 9 years, 624 primary eversion CEAs were performed in 580 selected patients to treat symptomatic (n = 398, 63.8%) and asymptomatic (n = 226, 36.2%) carotid lesions. All eversion CEAs were performed by the same surgeon (E.B.), with the patient under deep general anesthesia, with continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring for selective shunting, based exclusively on EEG changes consistent with cerebral ischemia. A Pruitt-Inahara shunt was used in 43 eversion CEAs (6.9%). All patients underwent postoperative duplex ultrasound scanning and clinical follow-up at 1, 6, and 12 months and once a year thereafter. Mean follow-up was 52 months (range, 3-91 months). The main end points were perioperative (30-day) stroke and death, and recurrent stenosis.
No perioperative death occurred in this series. Overall, ischemic perioperative stroke occurred in 4 of 624 patients (0.6%). Two strokes were minor and two were major. Only one (major) stroke occurred in the group with shunt insertion (1 of 43, 2.3%; P = not significant); the everted internal carotid artery was patent. Long-term follow-up was performed in all living patients. There was no late recurrent stenosis (>50%), and one late asymptomatic occlusive event occurred in the group without shunt insertion.
Shunt insertion can be safely performed during eversion CEA. Perioperative mortality and morbidity after eversion CEA are not statistically modified with shunting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14603215/

Each concentration level lasted for 30 minutes. EEG was first visually analyzed. In quantitative EEG analysis, the 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) and peak frequency (PF) were determined after fast Fourier transformation.
Epileptiform discharges occurred in all eight subjects at 1.5 and 2 MAC levels of sevoflurane anesthesia. Three subjects showed electrographic seizures at 2 MAC level, in one case accompanied with clinical seizures despite muscle relaxation. Propofol did not produce remarkable epileptiform EEG phenomena at any level of anesthesia. Suppression and slowing of EEG activity were evident for both drugs with increasing concentration. Owing to the high incidence of epileptiform events in the sevoflurane group at 1.5 and 2 MAC, the SEF95 and PF values were higher (p < 0.001) compared with propofol. Within the sevoflurane group, these values were higher at the 2 than at the 1.5 MAC level (p values ranged between <0.001 and 0.019).

The experimental procedure was performed during nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with mild hypothermia (32 degrees C) in fentanyl-anesthestized patients. Middle cerebral artery transcranial Doppler flow velocity, right jugular vein bulb oxygen saturation, and jugular venous pressure (JVP) were continuously measured. Autoregulation was tested during changes in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) within a range of 40-80 mm Hg, induced by sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine before (control) and during additional isoflurane administration to an EEG burst-suppression level of 6-9/min. Isoflurane induced a 27% decrease in CBFV (P < 0.05) and a 13% decrease in COE (P < 0.05) compared with control. The slope of the positive relationship between CBFV and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP - JVP) was steeper with isoflurane (P < 0.05) compared with control, as was the slope of the negative relationship between CPP and COE (P < 0.05). We conclude that burst-suppression doses of isoflurane decrease CBFV and impair autoregulation of cerebral blood flow during mildly hypothermic CPB. Furthermore, during isoflurane administration, blood flow was in excess relative to oxygen demand, indicating a loss of metabolic autoregulation of flow.
The effects of isoflurane on cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and oxygen extraction (COE) as a function of perfusion pressure were studied.

14524640,Comparing the bispectral index and suppression ratio with burst suppression of the electroencephalogram during pentobarbital infusions in adult intensive care patients.,Pharmacotherapy,2003,"Riker RR, Fraser GL, Wilkins ML","The bispectral index (BIS), a processed variable derived from the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) used to guide sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU), has not been tested during barbiturate therapy for elevated intracranial pressure. We determined the BIS and suppression ratio (SR) values during traditional burst monitoring of the raw EEG during pentobarbital infusions.
Prospective, observational cohort study.
A 42-bed multidisciplinary ICU in a tertiary care medical center.
Twelve consecutive patients with elevated intracranial pressure treated with pentobarbital infusions.
All patients were monitored continuously with the Aspect Medical Systems A-1050 bedside EEG monitor using a bilateral referential montage. Pentobarbital doses were titrated based on the raw EEG to attain a burst-suppression pattern with a goal of 3-5 bursts/minute. Drug dosage, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure values, EEG bursts/minute, BIS version 3.2, and SR were recorded daily.
The 12 patients were monitored for 62 patient-days. Mean +/- SD age was 32 +/- 15 years, seven (58%) patients were male, mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Heath Evaluation II score was 17.0 +/- 5.0, and hospital mortality was 42%. The mean pentobarbital infusion rate was 124 +/- 49 mg/hour or 2.3 +/- 1.3 mg/kg/hour, and mean pentobarbital serum concentration was 29.7 +/- 13 microg/ml. The mean BIS value was 18 +/- 14, mean SR 56% +/- 36%; BIS correlated well with SR (r=-0.99, p<0.001). For patient-days with a burst-suppression pattern, BIS 3.2 (r=0.90, p<0.001) and SR (r=-0.89, p<0.001) strongly correlated with the number of bursts/minute. The mean BIS value corresponding to 3-5 bursts/minute was 15 (95% confidence interval [CI] 10-20); SR value was 71 (95% CI 61-80).
The Aspect A-1050 applied to patients and monitored by nurses and physicians works well as a bedside EEG monitor, providing a raw EEG signal to titrate barbiturate therapy. The continuous data trend and real-time digital output for the BIS and SR quantify the degree of EEG suppression well and may prove helpful in facilitating titration of barbiturate infusions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14524640/

Adult patients having panendoscopy, microlaryngoscopy, or tonsillectomy were randomly assigned to receive either propofol-pronounced (propofol 100 microg x kg(-1) min(-1); remifentanil 0.15 microg x kg(-1) min(-1)) or remifentanil-pronounced (propofol 50 microg x kg(-1) min(-1); remifentanil 0.45 microg x kg(-1) min(-1)) anaesthesia. In both groups, the procedure was started with remifentanil 0.4 microg x kg(-1), propofol 2 mg x kg(-1), and mivacurium 0.2 mg x kg(-1). Cardiovascular measurements and EEG bispectral index (BIS) were recorded. To maintain comparable anaesthetic depth, additional propofol (0.5 mg x kg(-1)) was given if BIS values were greater than 55 and remifentanil (0.4 microg x kg(-1)) if heart rate or arterial pressure was greater than 110% of pre-anaesthetic values.
Patient and surgical characteristics, cardiovascular measurements, and BIS values were similar in both groups. There were no differences in recovery times between the groups (time to extubation: 12.7 (4.5) vs 12.0 (3.6) min, readiness for transfer to the recovery ward: 14.4 (4.4) vs. 13.7 (3.6) min, mean (SD)).
In patients having short painful surgery, less propofol does not give faster recovery as long as the same anaesthetic level (as indicated by BIS and clinical signs) is maintained by more remifentanil. However, recovery times were less variable following remifentanil-pronounced anaesthesia suggesting a more predictable recovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14504162/

Stroke is the commonest risk factor during CEA, therefore, cerebral monitoring became essential. Currently the EEG bispectral index (BIS) is used as a monitor of depth of anesthesia and it has showed decreasing trend during cerebral ischemia. We conducted this study to document the changes of the BIS variable during CEA under anesthesia.
Ten patients who underwent CEA under general anesthesia were studied. The EEG BIS was measured during the perioperative period where five phases were identified: (A) before induction of anesthesia, (B) before clamping of ICA, (C) during clamping of ICA, (D) after declamping of ICA and (E) during the recovery from anesthesia.
The age ranged between 53-69 yr. The mean values of the BIS were 91.4 +/- 5.6, 59.6 +/- 18.7, 44.3 +/- 6.8, 54.7 +/- 8.3 and 72.1 +/- 12.4 during A, B, C, D and E phases respectively with statistical significant low values during B, C, D and E phases versus phase A.

In this study, we investigated the effects of TRH administration on seizure threshold and seizure duration in 13 depressed inpatients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In a balanced order crossover design, an intravenous bolus of 0.4 mg TRH or placebo was administered immediately before anesthesia, during the first two sessions, in a series of bilateral ECT. In both of these sessions, a threshold titration procedure was applied by using gradual increments of the electrical charge delivered until seizure elicitation, a procedure that has been safely used in the past. Seizure threshold was defined as the lowest energy level required for induction of a grand mal seizure, by use of this titration procedure. Seizure duration was estimated both by simultaneous EEG recording and by the cuff method. Results showed that neither seizure threshold, nor seizure duration (either by cuff or by EEG) differed between the TRH and the placebo conditions, regardless of the order in which TRH or placebo were administered in the two ECT sessions. This was the case regardless of whether the patients had at baseline a blunted TSH response to TRH or not. Our findings do not support a role for TRH on seizure modulation, at least when TRH is administered exogenously. Such an effect, if it exists, could be obscured, however, by several factors, including pharmacokinetics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12972982/
12972980,Indications for the use of propofol in electroconvulsive therapy.,The journal of ECT,2003,"Bailine SH, Petrides G, Doft M, Lui G","Propofol is an anesthetic agent commonly used for ambulatory surgery because is associated with rapid recovery and a benign side effect profile. In electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), its use is limited because of its seizure-shortening effects, and is recommended only for patients with preexisting cardiac conditions requiring attenuated hemodynamic response during treatment. We have identified two additional significant indications for propofol: to induce shorter seizures in patients with prolonged seizures and to minimize post-ictal nausea and vomiting.
We reviewed the records of 340 patients treated with ECT. We identified 28 patients who were switched from methohexital to propofol anesthesia due to adverse effects or to avoid prolonged seizures.
Twenty-two patients were switched from methohexital anesthesia to propofol because they had already experienced long seizures. Nine patients had seizures longer than 180 seconds requiring termination with a benzodiazepine. The switch resulted in an average shortening of the EEG recorded seizures by 38.7%. Eight of the 22 (36.4%) patients were adolescents. These 8 comprised 53% of the total of 15 adolescents treated with ECT in our service. Five of the 15 (33%) had seizures longer than 180 seconds. Finally, 7 of the 28 patients were switched to propofol because of nausea and vomiting, which was significantly reduced. No side effects were noted, and none of these patients needed to switch back to methohexital.
Propofol may be a useful alternative to methohexital for the treatment of patients who have excessively long seizures and/or severe nausea and vomiting after ECT. Such seizures are more common among adolescents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12972980/

This has been reported for the combined use of methohexital and remifentanil in elderly patients, but has not been investigated in middle-aged patients likely to require a higher total dose of methohexital for inducing anesthesia.
Seven patients (42+/-10 years; mean +/-SD) receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) were anesthetized with methohexital (1.25 mg kg-1) or with methohexital (0.625 mg kg-1) plus remifentanil (1 micro g kg-1) in this randomized, double blind, crossover study. Additional methohexital was given as needed until loss of eyelash reflex was observed. Suxamethonium (1 mg kg-1) was used for muscular paralysis.
Motor and EEG seizure durations were significantly longer after induction with methohexital plus remifentanil (45+/-14 and 58+/-15 s) than with methohexital alone (31+/-11 and 42+/-18 s). A methohexital dose of 1.2+/-0.3 and 1.9+/-0.3 mg was necessary to achieve loss of eyelash reflex if methohexital was used with and without remifentanil. Peak heart rate after ECT was significantly higher if remifentanil was coadministered with methohexital (148+/-12 vs. 126+/-24 b.p.m).
Substituting part of the methohexital dose with remifentanil is a useful anesthetic technique to prolong seizure duration in middle-aged patients requiring a 1.5-fold higher induction dose of methohexital than elderly patients, the only population studied to date for the combined use of methohexital and remifentanil in ECT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12969096/

We conducted a BIS-based investigation of etomidate induction of general anaesthesia.
Thirty hydroxyzine-premedicated ASA I patients were randomly allocated to receive etomidate 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4 mg kg(-1) intravenously over 30 s. The BIS was continuously recorded. A tourniquet was placed on a lower limb to record purposeful movements and myoclonia. Tracheal intubation was facilitated using rocuronium 0.6 mg kg(-1) when the BIS value was 50. The times to disappearance of the eyelash reflex, to a decrease in the BIS to 50, and to tracheal intubation were compared. The BIS values 30 s following tracheal intubation, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) at all time points were also recorded.
The BIS value decreased to 50 for tracheal intubation with no purposeful movement in all but one patient in the 0.2 mg kg(-1) group. There was no difference between the etomidate groups (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg kg(-1)) in regards to time to loss of the eyelash reflex (103 (67), 65 (34), 116 (86) s, P=0.2), or to a decrease in BIS to 50 (135 (81), 82 (36), 150 (84) s, P=0.1). Also, the BIS value 30 s after intubation (41 (10), 37 (4), 37 (4), P=0.4), and plasma etomidate concentrations (161 [29-998], 308 [111-730], 310 [90-869] ng ml(-1), P=0.2) did not differ between groups. The time to loss of the eyelash reflex was 12-140 s shorter than the time to a decrease in BIS to 50 in three patients in each group who received etomidate 0.2 and 0.4 mg kg(-1), and in four patients who received 0.3 mg kg(-1). No awareness was recorded. MAP and HR increases following tracheal intubation were comparable between groups.

We measured the ability of PSI and BIS to distinguish consciousness from unconsciousness during induction and emergence from anaesthesia and a period of awareness in surgical patients.
Forty unpremedicated patients were randomized to receive: (1) sevoflurane/remifentanil (< or =0.1 microg kg(-1) min(-1)), (2) sevoflurane/remifentanil (> or = 0.2 microg kg(-1) min(-1)), (3) propofol/remifentanil (< or =0.1 microg kg(-1) min(-1)), (4) propofol/remifentanil (> or = 0.2 microg kg(-1) min(-1)). Every 30 s after the start of the remifentanil, patients were asked to squeeze the investigator's hand. Sevoflurane or propofol were given until loss of consciousness (LOC1). Tunstall's isolated forearm technique was used during neuromuscular block with succinylcholine. After tracheal intubation, propofol or sevoflurane were stopped until return of consciousness (ROC1). Propofol or sevoflurane were re-started to induce LOC2. After surgery, drugs were discontinued and recovery (ROC2) was observed. PSI and BIS at LOC (LOC1 and LOC2) were compared with those at ROC (ROC1 and ROC2) (t-test). Prediction probability (P(k)) was calculated from values at the last command before and at LOC and ROC. Values are mean (SD).
At non-responsiveness, BIS (66 (17)) and PSI (55 (23)) were significantly less than at responsiveness (BIS, 79 (14); PSI, 77 (18); P<0.05). The wide variation with both BIS and PSI measurements of the 80 'awareness' values led to an erroneous classification as unconscious in some cases (BIS, six patients; PSI, nine patients). P(k) was 0.68 (0.03) (BIS) and 0.69 (0.03) (PSI).
Despite significant differences between mean values at responsiveness and non-responsiveness for BIS and PSI, neither measure may be sufficient to detect awareness in an individual patient, reflected by a P(k) less than below 70%.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12925469/

Prospective psychophysical test in people. Single injection or progressively increasing infusions of ketamine in cats. ANIMALS AND PEOPLE: Seven people (20-60 years old) and three cats (3-5 kg) for EEG recording and six cats for EMG recordings.
In order to define innocuous and nociceptive stimulus intensities which could be applied to cats to evaluate arousal, psychophysical evaluations of sensations elicited by compression of the skin overlying phalangeal bones of the hand were obtained from human subjects. Then, following administration of ketamine, recordings of EEG frequency and of autonomic responses (heart rate, respiratory rate and arterial blood pressure) were obtained before and during stimulation of the tails of cats at pressures identified by human observers as either innocuous or nociceptive. Observations of withdrawal reflexes of the hindlimbs following interdigital skin stimulation were interposed between recording periods. In separate sessions, stretch reflex activity was assessed during awake and anesthetic conditions by recording electromyographic activity from soleus muscles and resistive force to dorsiflexion of the tibiotarsal joint.
There were no changes in either total EEG (0.5-30.0 Hz), low-frequency (0.6-7.5 Hz) or high-frequency (7.5-30.0 Hz) power produced by nociceptive stimulation for a period of 18-24 minutes following an intramuscular bolus dose of ketamine (33.0 mg kg-1), although withdrawal reflexes were present. Thereafter, nociceptive stimulation produced EEG arousal responses in the low-frequency and total power range and increased systolic blood pressure and respiration rate. In tests after intravenous infusion of ketamine (10.0-22.2 mg kg-1 hour-1), total and low-frequency EEG power and autonomic responses to nociceptive stimulation were eliminated. Organized motor responses were never elicited during IV infusion, but withdrawal reflexes were observed at each dosage. Also, stretch reflexes were shown by quantitative analysis to be retained at all doses of ketamine infusion.
These results show that testing of withdrawal reflexes does not reveal the adequacy of ketamine anesthesia. Segmental stretch and withdrawal reflexes are preserved and can be investigated during infusion of ketamine at doses that eliminate arousal from brief periods of nociceptive stimulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12925181/

Therefore, we used prediction probability (PK) to evaluate the performance of the bispectral index (BIS) of the EEG and automated responsiveness test (ART) to predict sedation depth and loss of subject's responsiveness during propofol sedation, with and without N2O.
Twenty volunteers were studied during propofol administration with (N2O) and without (Air) N2O. The protocol consisted of sequential 15-min cycles. After a control period, propofol was infused to a target effect-site concentration of 0.25 microg/ml (N2O) or 1.5 microg/ml (Air), which was subsequently increased by 0.25 or 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, until loss of responsiveness was detected by loss of response to command [observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score <or= 2].
Deeply sedated patients did not respond to ART indicating that the sensitivity was 1.0 with or without N2O. The specificity of ART was 0.24 with Air and 0.98 with N2O. The BIS was better than ART in predicting OAA/S score (PK = 0.84 vs. 0.77) and loss of responsiveness (PK = 0.87 vs. 0.69) during the Air trial. Nitrous oxide decreased the performance of BIS in predicting OAA/S score (PK = 0.76), but increased the performance of ART to predict loss of responsiveness (PK = 0.85).
BIS and ART comparably predict sedation and loss of responsiveness. However, ART, because of its resistance to false-normal responses, might prove to be more useful on an individual patient basis - especially in the presence of agents that impair BIS sensitivity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12904186/

Our aims were: to evaluate variations of BIS in the presence of high EMG activity associated with muscular rigidity after administration of high-dose fentanyl; to compare muscular rigidity, as measured by the EMG variable of the BIS monitor, in patients who were administered two different dosages of fentanyl at induction of cardiac anaesthesia.
26 patients undergoing CABG surgery, after premedication with morphine 0.15 mg/kg, were randomized to receive either fentanyl 50 mcg/kg (group F) or fentanyl 10 mcg/kg plus etomidate 0.2 mg/kg (group EF). The induction dose was administered over 2 minutes. Patients were manually ventilated with O2 via face mask. Five minutes after induction was complete, patients were clinically assessed using the Responsiveness portion of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale (OAAS). Haemodynamic data were recorded and arterial blood samples obtained at the time of OAAS observation. Patients were administered a neuromuscular blocking agent only after the OAAS assessment. BIS (3.4) was recorded from an A-2000 EEG monitor (Aspect Medical Systems) using disposable sensors (BIS Sensor, Aspect Medical Systems) applied per manufacturer's instructions. Data were recorded on a PC for off-line analysis.
At the time of OAAS observation, mean (95% CI) BIS in group F was 85 (77-92) compared to 67 (56-79) in group EF (p = 0.01). Similarly, mean (95% CI) EMG was 50 dB (45-56) in F and 41 dB (35-47) in EF (p = 0.01). Correlation between BIS and EMG was very high (r2 = 0.88). OAAS scores were significantly higher in group F (p = 0.03). Non significant correlation was observed between BIS and OAAS scores (r2 = 0.32, p = 0.1). Backward stepwise multiple regression analysis including EMG, pH, CO2, O2 and OASS scores showed EMG as strong predictor of BIS (p < 0.0001, r2 = 0.7). Regression of EMG against BIS yielded the equation: BIS = 3.7 + (1.6 x EMG).
During fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity BIS recordings reflect EMG variations. When assessing BIS in the absence of neuromuscular blockade, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of EMG on BIS before making conclusions about depth of sedation. Fentanyl-induced rigidity appears to be a dose-related phenomenon which the EMG variable of BIS 3.4 is able to quantify.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12885182/

This work compares three techniques: Wave Deformation Parameters (PDO), Auditory Evoked Potential Index (AEPidx) and an automatic Nb-wave latency estimator (Nb), in the assessment of unconsciousness onset based on EEG under auditory stimulation.
Ten normal adult volunteers, under no pre-anaesthetic drug administration, received propofol during two successive periods of 45 min each one (3 mg/Kg/h and 9 mg/Kg/h), being the EEG collected from 10 min previous to infusion beginning until the subjects woke up. From the time-evolution of MLAEP (averaging of successive sets of 1000 epochs) all the parameters were compared to thresholds (unconsciousness onset indication time) and the results were compared to the instant of pressing interruption of a soft-touch switch, when one assumed the volunteer became unconscious.
The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test points equivalence between each of the parameters and the switch for, say, alpha = 5%. Bland-Altman diagrams revealed that the Attenuation-PDO has better agreement to the switch than Nb and AEPidx.
The results suggest that, at least to indicate unconsciousness, the most reliable effect of the anaesthetic drug on MLAEP would be the amplitude attenuation. Despite the high dependence on noise due to its time-domain basis, the Attenuation-PDO seems to be adequate to assess depth of anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12885180/

A processed derivative is obtained and displayed graphically and numerically on a monitor and may be used during anesthesia to indicate anesthetic ""depth."" However, radio-frequency interference from electrical equipment typically used in the operating room has the potential to interfere with the analysis of the high frequency components of the EEG.
The objective of this study was to determine the ability of the Nicolet EEG monitoring device to function satisfactorily and effectively in the operating arena when used for anesthetized patients.
A total of 40 patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia were monitored using a prototype, processed EEG monitoring device. The device was used beginning prior to induction and continuing until emergence from anesthesia.
Analysis was performed on 38 of the 40 patients. Brief interruption of the derived EEG Index occurred during use of the monopolar electrosurgical unit (ESU) as well as during stimulation of the facial nerve (used to monitor pharmacologic muscle relaxation). Derived EEG Index interruption was also noted during some movements of the patient's head or the EEG electrode wires. Changes in the derived EEG Index value accompanied changes in inhaled concentration of anesthetics and, in one patient, change in the derived EEG Index preceded patient movement that was not heralded by the typical cardiovascular indications of ""light"" anesthesia.
The derived EEG Index monitoring system evaluated in this study functioned satisfactorily in the operating room setting in patients undergoing general anesthesia. Interference from ESU, facial nerve stimulation, and movement of the electrode wires caused brief interruptions of the derived EEG Index display and did not affect its utility in monitoring brain activity during anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12885178/

It is difficult to establish the appropriate dose of general anaesthetic drugs in the morbidly obese patient. Moreover, there are conflicting data concerning adequate anaesthesia levels and the severity of postoperative pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the spectral edge frequency (SEF) during general anaesthesia and the severity of immediate postoperative pain following gastric banding surgery in morbidly obese patients.
Seventy-one ASA 2 morbidly obese patients (BMI > 35%) undergoing elective laparoscopic gastric banding procedure were recruited for this study. Anaesthesia consisted of midazolam, fentanyl and thiopental for induction, vecuronium for muscle relaxation, N2O and isoflurane with additional fentanyl administrations, according to the clinical judgement of the anaesthesiologist, for maintenance. Continuous SEF monitoring was added to the standard monitors (SpO2, ETCO2, ECG, NIBP, O2 and isoflurane concentration), but the EEG monitor screen was hidden from the anaesthesiologist's sight. SEF postoperative analysis divided the patients into two groups: group 1, SEF-recommended target range of 8-12 Hz, more than 80% of the surgical time; and group 2, SEF-recommended target range of 8-12 Hz, less than 80% of the surgery duration. Pain intensity was assessed in the post anaesthesia care unit using a standard visual analogue scale (VAS) of 10 cm, when patients were awake enough to correct a deliberately given wrong own telephone or ID number. Intravenous morphine was administered for postoperative analgesia in 2-mg increments, every 3-4 min, until the patient felt comfortable. A recovery room nurse unaware of the SEF range recorded during surgery registered pain severity and morphine requirements.
The end-tidal isoflurane concentration was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (0.83 vs. 0.7 P = 0.016). The intensity of pain at admission into the recovery room and at discharge was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 (VAS 6.1 vs. 6.9-P = 0.0049, and 3.9 vs. 4.2-P = 0.00478, respectively).

For this purpose, low-field (0.1-0.2 T) MR scanners have been installed in the operating room, which, in contrast to machines using higher magnetic field strength, allowed the use of standard anesthetic and surgical equipment. However, these low-field MR systems provided only minor image quality and a limited battery of MR sequences, excluding functional MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, or MR angiography and spectroscopy. Based on these advantages, a concept using high-field MRI (1.5 T) with intraoperative functional neuronavigational guidance has been developed that required adaptation of the anesthetic regimen to working in the close vicinity to the strong magnetic field. In this paper the authors present their experience with the first 80 consecutive patients who received anesthesia in a specially designed radio frequency-shielded operating room equipped with a high-field (1.5 T) MR scanner. We describe the MR-compatible anesthesia equipment used including ventilator, monitoring, and syringe pumps, which allow standard neuroanesthesia in this new and challenging environment. This equipment provides the use of total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil allowing rapid extubation and neurologic examination following surgery.

Optimal assessment of the nervous system is done by means of the clinical neurological examination. In this manner, orientation, arousal, and responsiveness to stimulation provide feedback on focal and global stability of the central nervous system. Where clinical evaluation is compromised, such as with deep sedation and NMB, risk of undetected seizure activity, and/or progression of neurological injury increases dramatically. A patient receiving NMB risks breakthrough awareness and pain. Long-term complications of NMB including prolonged weakness or paralysis as well as post-traumatic stress dramatically increase morbidity and length of stay. Technologies such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and bispectral index (BIS trade mark ) monitoring are effective for assessing cerebral function as well as level of sedation or arousal, respectively, in patients with a compromised neurological assessment. Neuromuscular transmission (NMT) monitoring by means of peripheral nerve stimulation and assessment of the evoked response may be utilized, within the context of clinical assessment, to determine level of chemical paralysis and minimize dosing of NMB agents. This article explores utilization and differentiates technologies such as EEG, BIS, and NMT monitoring. Monitoring parameters are illustrated using a case study approach.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12819456/

Here, we tested the relationship between hypnotic depth determined by computer system (Narcotrend(TM)) and implicit memory in anesthetized patients, assessed by a postoperative reading speed test. Thirty-two patients undergoing laparoscopic herniotomy and 30 age-matched volunteer controls were included the study. All patients received IV midazolam 2-3 mg followed by an induction dose of propofol and remifentanil. The anesthesia was maintained with propofol and remifentanil infusions and cisatracurium. Each patient was exposed to 2 of 4 stories, repeated 6 times. The first story was presented during light to moderate hypnotic EEG stages, and the second story was presented during deep hypnosis. Presentation of stories was balanced between patients and hypnotic stages. The controls listened to the two stories without receiving anesthesia. The reading speed for the previously presented stories and two new stories was measured approximately 7 h later with a computer program. No signs of inadequate anesthesia were observed, and no explicit memories of intraoperative events were revealed by a structured interview. No change of reading speed was observed for words presented during deep hypnotic stages. In contrast, an increased reading speed of 20 ms per word was found for content words (i.e., nouns, verbs, and adjectives), but not for function words (conjunctions, prepositions, and so on), presented during light to moderate hypnotic stages. Increased reading speed for semantically rich content words indicates that anesthetized patients are able to process acoustic information during light and moderate, but not deep, hypnosis.
In this study, implicit memory was observed during general anesthesia at light to moderate, but not deep, hypnotic stages. Hypnotic stages were determined by a commercial electroencephalogram device, and implicit memory was measured by using a postoperative reading speed task. During lighter phases of anesthesia, patients should be protected against acoustic information that could negatively influence their postoperative outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12818955/

An interdisciplinary challenge for anesthesiology and psychiatry.,Pharmacopsychiatry,2003,"Conca A, Germann R, König P","The choice of anesthetic for electroconvulsive therapy is based on the anesthetic requirements to be met and on the agent's impact on the seizure threshold. Thus, the non-barbiturate anesthesia etomidate revealed properties to enhance the seizure duration. Even though precisely this feature makes etomidate so valuable, little research has been done on the use of etomidate in ECT. The aim of the present study was to compare the barbiturate anesthesia thiopentone with etomidate, with the focus of attention being the quality of seizure. In 13 patients, the paradigm of a single intra-individual crossover anesthesia during maintenance ECT was selected. The excitatory effects and the electroencephalographic changes were described. Furthermore, significant differences in motor seizure duration (26.69 sec +/- 9.7 vs. 35.92 sec +/- 9.2; p < 0.007) and EEG seizure duration (39 sec +/- 14.1 sec vs. 61 sec +/- 22.2 sec; p < 0.0009) were observed. Our results confirm previous findings and reveal that after etomidate the quality of seizure can be improved not only in terms of duration. The growing knowledge of the mode of action of anesthetics/hypnotics from an anesthesiological point of view and the better understanding of subcortical and cortical mechanisms, with particular consideration of the motor seizure threshold, facilitate a differentiated choice of the narcotic and the optimization of short anesthesia in the course of electroconvulsive therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12806566/

We studied this pharmacodynamic interaction using the median power frequency of the processed electroencephalogram as a control parameter for feedback-controlled dosing of propofol.
Twenty-one patients were given total intravenous anaesthesia with remifentanil and propofol. During three target-controlled infusion regimens, the target concentrations of remifentanil (5, 10, 15 ng mL(-1)) and propofol dosing were automatically adjusted to keep the median power frequency in the range 2 +/- 0.5 Hz. In each patient and during each remifentanil target concentration, four arterial propofol/remifentanil concentration pairs were measured. The type of interaction was tested using the relative distance from the line of additivity and the isobole was modelled using Bernstein splines.
The results from 13 patients were used for data analysis. The measured remifentanil concentrations during the three targets were (mean +/- SD): 3.6 +/- 0.9, 8.1 +/- 2.5 and 12.4 +/- 2.8 ng mL(-1). The corresponding propofol concentrations were 2.64 +/- 0.86, 2.13 +/- 0.58 and 2.09 +/- 0.58 microg mL(-1).

This was a prospective observational study conducted in an urban county hospital of adult patients undergoing PS using propofol, methohexital, etomidate, and the combination of fentanyl and midazolam. Consenting patients were monitored by vital signs, pulse oximetry, nasal-sample end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)), and BIS monitors during PS. Respiratory depression (RD) was defined as an oxygen saturation <90%, a change from baseline ETCO(2) of >10 mm Hg, or an absent ETCO(2) waveform at any time during the procedure. After the procedure, patients were asked to complete three 100-mm visual analog scales (VASs) concerning their perception of pain, recall of the procedure, and satisfaction with the procedure. Patients were divided into four groups based on the lowest BIS score recorded during the procedure, group 1, >85; group 2, 70-85; group 3, 60-69; group 4, <60. Rates of RD and VAS outcomes were compared between groups using chi-square statistics.
One hundred eight patients were enrolled in the study. No serious adverse events were noted. RD was seen in three of 14 (21.4%) of the patients in group 1, seven of 34 (20.6%) in group 2, 16 of 26 (61.5%) in group 3, and 18 of 34 (52.9%) in group 4. The rate of RD in patients in group 2 was not significantly different from that in group 1 (p = 0.46). The rate of RD in group 2 was significantly lower than that in groups 3 (p = 0.0003) and 4 (p = 0.006). For the VAS data, when group 1 was compared with the combined groups 2, 3, and 4, it had significantly higher rates of pain (p = 0.003) and recall (p = 0.001), and a dissatisfaction rate (p = 0.085) that approached significance. When groups 2, 3, and 4 were compared with chi-square test, there was not a significant difference in pain (p = 0.151), recall (p = 0.27), or satisfaction (p = 0.25).
Patients with a lowest recorded BIS score between 70 and 85 had the same VAS outcomes as more deeply sedated patients and the same rate of RD as less deeply sedated patients. This range of scores represented the optimally sedated patients in this study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12782525/
12760987,Can the bispectral index be used to predict seizure time and awakening after electroconvulsive therapy?,Anesthesia and analgesia,2003,"White PF, Rawal S, Recart A, Thornton L, Litle M, Stool L","The electroencephalogram (EEG) bispectral index (BIS) measures the hypnotic component of the anesthetic state and correlates with emergence from general anesthesia. Therefore, we hypothesized that the BIS would be useful in predicting electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced seizure times and awakening from methohexital anesthesia. Twenty-five consenting patients with major depressive disorders underwent 100 maintenance ECT treatments. All patients were premedicated with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV, and anesthesia was induced with methohexital 1 mg/kg IV. The BIS was monitored continuously, and the values were recorded at specific end-points, including before anesthesia (baseline), after the induction of anesthesia (pre-ECT), at the end of ECT (peak), after ECT (suppression), and on awakening (eye opening). The pre-ECT BIS value correlated with the duration of both the motor (r = 0.3) and EEG (r = 0.4) seizure activity (P < 0.05). The peak post-ECT BIS value correlated with the duration of the EEG seizure activity (r = 0.5) (P < 0.05). A positive correlation was also found between the EEG seizure duration and the time to eye opening (r = 0.4) (P < 0.05). However, the BIS values on awakening from methohexital anesthesia varied from 29 to 97 and were <60 in 75% of the cases. We conclude that the BIS value before the ECT stimulus is applied could be useful in predicting the seizure time. However, the BIS values on awakening were highly variable, suggesting that it reflects both the residual depressant effects of methohexital and post-ictal depression.
The bispectral index (BIS) value immediately before the electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) stimulus correlates with the duration of the motor and electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure activity during methohexital anesthesia. In addition, the increase in the BIS value during the ECT-induced seizure was proportional to the duration of EEG seizure activity. However, the BIS value on awakening from anesthesia varied widely, from 29 to 97.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12760987/

Prospective, open-label study.
Operating room of a university hospital.
28 patients, aging 20 to 50 years, scheduled for elective, 1- to 4-hour surgeries under general anesthesia.
BIS was continuously monitored from bifrontal montage (At1-Fpz and At2-Fpz) using an Aspect A-1,050 EEG system (Aspect, Natick, MA). Anesthesia was induced with bolus injections of fentanyl 2 microg/kg and propofol 2 mg/kg, and maintained with intermittent injections of fentanyl and constant infusion of propofol. Propofol infusion was stopped at the end of surgery.
Consciousness and orientation were assessed as clinical endpoints once every 2 minutes following the end of the surgery. Blood samples were extracted for plasma propofol and fentanyl concentrations (PCp and FCp, respectively), and BIS values were recorded when patients regained consciousness and orientation. Patients were allocated to one of three groups depending on FCp on awakening: Group 1, FCp > 1 microg/L (n = 8); Group 2, FCp < 1 microg/L and >0.45 microg/L (n = 9); and Group 3, FCp < 0.45 microg/L (n = 11). PCp, BIS, recovery time, and other data were compared between the three groups.
Demographic values, duration of surgery, and consumption of propofol and fentanyl were not different between the three groups. Group 3 patients regained consciousness with significantly higher propofol concentration (mean PCp = 3.2 mg/L) compared with those in Groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.05). However, the BIS values at both recovery endpoints were not different among the three groups.
The plasma levels of fentanyl affect the concentrations of propofol required for patients to regain consciousness. The BIS values for wakefulness are unaltered at the different combinations of propofol and fentanyl concentrations. Thus, the BIS appears to be a useful and consistent indicator for level of consciousness during emergence from propofol/fentanyl intravenous anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12719048/

We measured the scalp EEG with a dense electrode (128-channel) montage during the course of light general anaesthesia with xenon and then propofol in normal human subjects. EEG was measured during induction and recovery of general anaesthesia in five normal subjects, and we obtained analysable data from three of these subjects. EEG topographies were plotted on a realistic head surface. Scalp fields were spatially de-blurred using a realistic head model and projected onto an averaged cortical surface Both xenon and propofol elicited large increases in midline frontal theta-band EEG power. Propofol reliably elicited orbitofrontal delta activity. Xenon, but not propofol, caused large increases in delta over the posterior cortex. Increased gamma power was observed for both anaesthetic agents at midline electrodes over the posterior cortex, but not anteriorly. Anaesthesia-induced delta and theta waves were differentially distributed along the anterior-posterior axis of the brain in a manner that corresponds well to the anatomy of putative neuronal generators. The distribution of anaesthetic-induced changes in fast gamma-band power seems to reflect functional differences between the posterior and anterior aspects of the cerebral cortex. These preliminary observations were consistent within our small sample, indicating that larger studies of anaesthetic effects using high-density recordings are warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12712778/

Patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia may show an increase in slow wave and a decrease in fast wave activity of the electroencephalogram (EEG). BIS is presumed to decrease with EEG slowing. We hypothesized that the baseline ""awake"" BIS is lower in dementia than in normal elderly patients. We studied 36 patients with Alzheimer's disease or multiinfarct dementia and 36 control patients aged >75 yr. Both groups were assessed with a Mini-Mental State Test. BIS (version 3.4) was recorded from a frontal derivation using an Aspect A-2000 EEG monitor. Off-line data analysis was also performed with the newer version 4.0 of the BIS algorithm. Fourteen of 36 (38%) dementia patients and 4 of 36 (11%) controls had mean baseline BIS 3.4 <93 (P = 0.006). Eighteen of 36 (50%) dementia patients and 8 of 36 (22%) controls had mean BIS 4.0 <93 (P = 0.026). Mean (95% confidence interval) BIS 3.4 was 92.9 (91-95) in the dementia and 96.1 (95-97) in the control group (P = 0.02). Values with BIS 4.0 were, respectively, 89.1 (86-92) and 94.7 (93-96) (P = 0.002). No significant difference was found in age, sex, activity from the electromyogram, and signal quality index. As expected, the difference in Mini-Mental State Test scores was significant (P < 0.0001). A significant proportion of patients with dementia shows a low baseline BIS. The utility of the BIS monitor in detecting dementia warrants further investigation.

This study was conducted to investigate changes in several measures usually viewed as reflecting states of sedation/sleepiness associated with the use of a range of doses of the hypnotic benzodiazepine (BZD) flunitrazepam (FNZ).
This was a double blind, independent group design study of the effects of acute oral doses of FNZ in young healthy volunteers. Forty-eight subjects were randomly allocated to one of four groups-FNZ (0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mg) and placebo (PLAC)-and tested prior to treatment and then in a posttreatment session close to the theoretical peak plasma concentration. ERP latencies and amplitudes were measured at midfrontal (Fz), midcentral (Cz), and midparietal (Pz) using a standard auditory oddball paradigm. EEG changes were assessed at Pz. Behavioural measures included the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST), a cancellation task (CT), and subjective ratings of alertness and attentiveness by the subjects (SUB) and the experimenter (EXP).
FNZ led to psychomotor impairments and decreased alertness and attention; these effects were consistent with previous findings. A progressive, dose-related increase in P3 latency occurred in Fz, Cz, and Pz, and there was an increase in N1 (Fz, Cz) and N2 (Fz). N2-P3 amplitude decreased in Fz. EEG power bands beta 1 increased for the two highest doses, but no significant differences were noted in theta, delta, and alpha bands. P3 latencies, experimenter-rated levels of alertness, and DSST scores differentiated all three doses of FNZ from PLAC.
The most sensitive measures used were P3 latencies of the ERPs (which varied with FNZ dose), DSST, and the experimenter-rated levels of alertness. However, we found no evidence for the assumption that one single phenomenon was reflected in all measures and different mechanisms were probably involved. Further experiments will be needed for more in-depth probing of the finer mechanisms underlying sedation/sleepiness and how they affect behavioural and eletrophysiological measures of the central nervous system (CNS) function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12691789/

Twenty consenting patients with major depressive disorders receiving maintenance ECT participated in this study. Eighty ECT treatments were evaluated. All patients were premedicated with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV, unconsciousness was induced with methohexital 1 mg/kg IV, and muscle paralysis was produced with succinylcholine 1.2 mg/kg IV. Subsequently, patients received 1 of 3 different doses of remifentanil 25, 50, and 100 microg or saline (control) in a random sequence immediately after methohexital at 4 consecutive ECT treatments. Labetalol, in 5-mg IV boluses, was used as a rescue antihypertensive medication. A fixed suprathreshold electrical stimulus was administered to elicit a seizure, and the times from the stimulus to the cessation of the motor and electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure activity were noted. Pre- and post-ECT blood pressure values were significantly decreased in the 100- microg remifentanil group compared with the control group. The durations of motor (38 +/- 9 s to 43 +/- 15 s) and EEG (55 +/- 29 s to 60 +/- 21 s) seizure activity were not significantly different among the four groups. Similarly, recovery times to eye opening, obeying commands, and discharge from the recovery room did not differ among the four study groups. The requirement for labetalol after ECT was nonsignificantly decreased in the remifentanil groups. In conclusion, remifentanil 100 microg IV attenuated the acute hemodynamic response to ECT. Furthermore, remifentanil had no adverse effect on the duration of ECT-induced seizure activity. Finally, adjunctive use of remifentanil did not prolong recovery times or increase post-ECT side effects.

The MI between four lead electrodes was first computed using the EEG time series. The Lempel-Ziv complexity measures, C(n)s, were extracted from the MI time series. Prediction was made by means of artificial neural network (ANN). From 98 consenting patient experiments, 98 distinct EEG recordings were collected prior to incision during isoflurane anaesthesia of different levels. During and after skin incision, each patient was observed carefully for 2 min to detect subsequent responses (purposeful movement, changes in hemodynamic parameters and respiratory pattern) and then the EEG was labelled as 0.0 for responder or as 1.0 for non-responder. Training and testing the ANN used the 'drop-one-patient' method. The prediction was tested by monitoring the response to incision and the result given by the ANN. The system was able to correctly classify purposeful response in average accuracy of 91.84% of the cases.

Depth of anesthesia may influence the neuro-hormonal release, including catecholamines. Opioids depress general sympathetic activation in a dose-dependent manner. We investigated the hypothesis that remifentanil would depress the catecholamine response to pneumoperitoneum and laparoscopic surgery differently with a high dose (HD) compared with a low dose (LD).
In a randomized, prospective study we investigated 18 ASA I-II patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication with an intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mmHg. The patients were randomized to receive either a LD (0.13 microg kg-1x min-1) or HD (0.39 microg kg-1 x min-1) of remifentanil with a target-controlled infusion (TCI) technique. Bispectral index of EEG (BIS) was maintained at 40-55 by propofol delivered by a TCI system. Arterial catecholamines were analyzed at different times during the procedure.
Norepinephrine increased equally in both groups during pneumoperitoneum and surgical intervention. Epinephrine stayed low in the HD-group, while increasing during surgery in the LD-group.
High dose of remifentanil depressed the epinephrine response to pneumoperitoneum and surgery, indicating no general activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Neither a LD nor HD of remifentanil depressed the norepinephrine response during pneumoperitoneum. This suggests a centrally independent release of norepinephrine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12648191/

We examined the correlation between 1) the clinically assessed state of consciousness, 2) implicit and explicit memory (by use of word pairs), and 3) various measures of EEG and AEP-bispectral index (BIS), A-Line ARX AEP index, spectral entropy, and entropy of the singular value decomposition (SVDEN; a measure of the complexity of the EEG). We studied 21 women during a two-stage awakening (sevoflurane washout followed by remifentanil washout) after anesthesia for gynecological surgery. All were amnesic, and 19 were unresponsive to verbal command with remifentanil alone. In six patients, BIS decreased paradoxically as the remifentanil concentration decreased; this was caused by a low-amplitude EEG, which was misinterpreted by the Aspect algorithm as burst suppression. Most of the EEG/AEP variables were sensitive to the decrease in sevoflurane and the recovery of consciousness, but not to the effects of decreasing remifentanil concentrations. SVDEN was the only variable that demonstrated significant increases for both the sevoflurane and remifentanil washout phases. With the prediction probability statistic during remifentanil washout, SVDEN = 0.79, spectral entropy = 0.81, A-Line ARX AEP index = 0.63, and BIS = 0.58. Entropy measures appear to be worthy of further clinical evaluation in a larger series of patients. SVDEN may be a useful variable for assessing anesthetic and analgesic effects on the central nervous system.
During the recovery phase from a remifentanil-based anesthetic, the bispectral index is not reliably predictive of the depth of consciousness, because of suppression ratio artifacts. Entropy measures of the electroencephalogram show promise, but there is still no gold standard to estimate anesthetic depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12598252/

Beyond a suppression ratio of 40%, BIS and suppression ratio were invariably linearly correlated (r = -1). At a suppression ratio > or = 40% the BIS value could be calculated as BIS = 50 - suppression ratio/2.
Suppression ratio values > 40% are linearly correlated with BIS values from 30 to 0. An increasing anesthetic drug effect resulting in an increase of the duration of suppression to a suppression ratio up to 40% is not adequately reflected by the BIS value.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12580235/
12578031,New approaches for the detection and analysis of electroencephalographic burst-suppression patterns in patients under sedation.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,1999,"Leistritz L, Jäger H, Schelenz C, Witte H, Putsche P, Specht M, Reinhart K","An automatic EEG pattern detection unit was developed and tested for the recognition of burst-suppression periods and for the separation of burst from suppression patterns. The median, standard deviation and the 95% edge frequency were computed from single channels of the EEG within a moving window and completed by the continuous computation of frequency band power via an adapted Hilbert resonance filter. These parameters were given to the inputs of two hierarchically arranged artificial neural networks (NNs). The output signals of NNs indicate the suppression and burst phases. The burst recognition was focused on the precise recognition of the burst onset. In subsequent processing steps the time course of percentages of burst patterns within their corresponding burst-suppression-phases was calculated and the time locations of burst onsets can be used to trigger an averaging for a burst-related analysis. The data for our investigations were derived from the routine EEG derivations of 12 patients with various neurosurgical diseases. A group-related training of the NNs was realized. For the group-related trained NNs EEG data for 6 patients were used for training and the data of 6 other patients for testing the classification performance of the pattern recognition units. Additionally, the reliability of the detection algorithm was tested with data of two patients with convulsive state, resistant to treatment, and burst-suppression like pattern EEC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12578031/
12575471,Rat models of genetic absence epilepsy: what do EEG spike-wave discharges tell us about drug effects?,Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology,2002,"van Luijtelaar EL, Drinkenburg WH, van Rijn CM, Coenen AM","Electroencephalographic studies in the WAG/Rij rats of Nijmegen and genetic absence epileptic rats of Strasbourg (GAERS), two genetic models for human generalized absence epilepsy, illustrate the usefulness of drug-electroencephalogram (EEG) interaction studies. In the EEG of both types of rats, spontaneously occurring spike-wave discharges are present. For drug discovery, a model with predictive validity is imperative, and both the WAG/Rij and the GAERS models seem adequate. The present paper discusses effects on spike-wave discharges of various compounds that are clinically used. Not only new antiepileptic drugs, such as remacemide, loreclezole, lamotrigine, tiagabine, gabapentin, progabide and levetiracetam are evaluated, but also drugs used for other purposes, such as etomidate and fentanyl-fluanisone for anesthesia, opioidergic drugs and drugs used for strokes. It is shown that some new antiepileptic drugs, such as tiagabine, have spike-wave discharge-increasing properties, while other drugs are worth studying in clinical trials for antiabsence treatment. Furthermore, it is shown that many commonly used drugs such as analgesics, anesthetics and drugs to treat stroke generally enhance spike-wave discharges. It can be concluded that EEG monitoring is imperative for the discovery and development of potentially antiepileptic compounds and that genetic rat models such as the WAG/Rij or GAERS, to a large extent, can reliably predict clinical efficacy of various types of compounds as well as alert us of potentially adverse effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12575471/

This comparison was carried out with data from consecutive index ECT treatments that occurred immediately before and after a switch from methohexital to ketamine in 36 patients. Ketamine was well tolerated and prolonged seizure duration overall, but particularly in those who had a seizure duration shorter than 25 seconds with methohexital at the maximum available stimulus intensity. Ketamine also increased midictal EEG slow-wave amplitude. Thus, a switch to ketamine may be useful when it is difficult to elicit a robust seizure.

The aim was to illustrate how haemodynamics may only poorly reflect the level of cortical suppression and that electroencephalographic monitoring could indicate different relationships between cortical effects and haemodynamics.
Anaesthesia was induced with thiopental (7 mg kg(-1)), and fentanyl (2 microg kg(-1)) with succinylcholine (1.5 mg kg(-1)) for neuromuscular blockade in the 11 patients of Group 1. In Group 2 (n = 15), thiopental (7 mg kg(-1)) and succinylcholine (1.5 mg kg(-1)) were given. In Group 3, the patients (n = 13) received thiopental (7 mg kg(-1)), fentanyl (2 microg kg(-1)) and cisatracurium (0.1 mg kg(-1)), and they were intubated 3 min later than the patients in Groups 1 and 2. We determined conventional electroencephalographic (EEG) variables and classified 14 EEG stages in real-time ranging from A (= 1), indicating full wakefulness, to F1 (= 14), at profound cortical suppression.
All groups had profound cortical suppression 45 s after thiopental administration, which rapidly decreased (EEG stage, 11 (6-13) versus 7 (2-13) at 4 min, P < 0.0001). Decreasing EEG stages were associated with increasing SEF 95, relative alpha and beta power and decreasing relative delta power. During tracheal intubation, profound cortical suppression remained unchanged in Groups 1 and 2. In Group 3, cortical suppression had decreased before laryngoscopy (P < 0.005). In Group 2, 11 patients had heart rate responses to tracheal intubation, whereas only two responded in Group 1 (P = 0.015) and three in Group 3 (P = 0.02). Thirteen patients in Group 2 had arterial pressure responses, and five in Group 1 (P = 0.038). Circulatory responses did not differ between Groups 1 and 3.
Electroencephalographic monitoring was suitable to indicate in real-time that haemodynamics only poorly reflect rapidly changing levels of cortical suppression, and how haemodynamics and cortical activity depend on the applied combination of hypnotic and analgesic drugs during anaesthesia induction with thiopental.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12553387/

Scoring systems commonly used still show some limitation; the introduction of Bispectral Index (an EEG parameter) could bring potential advantages in monitoring sedation. According to the reports, Bispectral Index correlates with levels of sedation on the Ramsay Scale. We report our personal experience in this topic.
Twenty patients, diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), were involved in the study. For an optimal adaptation to respiratory prothesis, they were sedated (with Propofol by continuous infusion at an initial dose of 2 mg/kg/h, which could be modulated with steps of 0.5 mg/kg/h), in order to maintain a Ramsay score of 4-5. BIS value was continuously recorded, and manually calculated on a mean average of a minute during the measuring of Ramsay score (T0) and every 30' for 24 hours on par with Ramsay score. EEG, SpO2, non invasive arterial pressure, ventilatory module, ETCO2, FIO2 were also recorded. For the statistic analysis, Friedman test and Spearman coefficient were utilized. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.
980 observations were carried out. The variation range of Ramsay Score was between 2 and 6. BIS range varied from 34 to 98. Statistic analysis of the data obtained pointed out some significative correlations, particularly between Ramsay Score and BIS (p < 0.01), and between BIS and dosage of Propofol (p < 0.01).
The results of the study are consistent with those found in the literature on this topic of study. In fact, this study demonstrates the utility of BIS to track levels of consciousness in ICU patients while still maintaining the use of the score systems to care for ICU patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12546259/
12510009,Neuroactive steroids: mechanisms of action and neuropsychopharmacological properties.,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2003,Rupprecht R,"Steroids influence neuronal function through binding to cognate intracellular receptors which may act as transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression. In addition, certain so-called neuroactive steroids modulate ligand-gated ion channels via non-genomic mechanisms. Especially distinct 3alpha-reduced metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone are potent positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors. However, also classical steroid hormones such as 17beta-estradiol, testosterone and progesterone are neuroactive steroids because they may act as functional antagonists at the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT(3)) receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel or distinct glutamate receptors. A structure-activity relationship for the actions of a variety of steroids at the 5-HT(3) receptor was elaborated that differed considerably from that known for GABA(A) receptors. Although a bindings site for steroids at GABA(A) receptors is still a matter of debate, meanwhile there is also evidence that steroids interact allosterically with ligand-gated ion channels at the receptor membrane interface. On the other hand, also 3alpha-reduced neuroactive steroids may regulate gene expression via the progesterone receptor after intracellular oxidation into 5alpha-pregnane steroids. Animal studies showed that progesterone is converted rapidly into GABAergic neuroactive steroids in vivo. Progesterone reduces locomotor activity in a dose-dependent fashion in male Wistar rats. Moreover, progesterone and 3alpha-reduced neuroactive steroids produce a benzodiazepine-like sleep EEG profile in rats and humans. During major depression, there is a disequilibrium of such 3alpha-reduced neuroactive steroids which is corrected by successful treatment with antidepressant drugs. Neuroactive steroids may further be involved in the treatment of depression and anxiety with antidepressants in patients during ethanol withdrawal. Studies in patients with panic disorder suggest that neuroactive steroids may also play a role in modulating human anxiety. Both the genomic and non-genomic effects of steroids in the brain may contribute to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. Neuroactive steroids affect a broad spectrum of behavioral functions through their unique molecular properties and may represent a new treatment strategy for neuropsychiatric disorders.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12510009/

Most of these newborns are sedated by opioids because of long-term assisted ventilation. The aim of this study was to describe the effects of sufentanil on the EEG in preterm newborns and to evaluate the consequences of such a treatment on neurologic assessment.
Fifteen preterm newborns <28 days of extrauterine life were studied. All of them were sedated by sufentanil (initial bolus injection of 0.5 micro g/kg, followed by continuous infusion of 0.2 micro g/kg/h). Three EEGs were performed: the first before and during the bolus injection, the second in the 48 hours after the start of the continuous infusion, and the third at least 24 hours after the treatment was stopped. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to analyze each EEG.
EEG patterns were not affected by sufentanil treatment. Bolus injection and continuous infusion induced a significant increase of EEG discontinuity in preterm newborns affecting mean burst percentage and mean and maximum interburst duration.
The present data demonstrate that EEG is affected by bolus injection and continuous infusion of sufentanil. Sedation must therefore be considered to avoid misinterpretation of EEGs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12509564/

Subjects were studied on day 10 and day 36 of treatment, with tests of nocturnal sleep, driving performance, continuous electroencephalogram (EEG), sleep during scheduled naps, computerized visual attention tasks, saccadic eye movement measurement and visual analogue ratings of mood. Both drugs had a marked suppressive effect on nocturnal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep; these effects were less at 36 days than at 10 days, and fluoxetine decreased and dothiepin increased REM in daytime naps. Sleep fragmentation after fluoxetine is similar to that reported in the literature. We found no sleep-promoting effects of dothiepin, in contrast to our previous single-dose study, and no subjective sleep effects of either drug. Subjects were less sleepy after both antidepressants than placebo at 5 weeks measured by sleep latencies and EEG. Saccadic eye movement measures were significantly faster after 5 weeks of fluoxetine than after 5 weeks of placebo. Reaction times to a peripheral stimulus during computerized tracking task were shorter after 10 days of dothiepin compared with placebo.

A male 42-year-old patient who begins at 26 with partial complex drug-resistant seizures is put forward. MRI shows a 9 mm diameter lesion located in left superior temporal gyrus which seems compatible with cavernoma. Both conventional and sleep deprivation EEGs have proved normal. Sleep EEG shows sharp waves in left temporal region. MEG helps to localize interictal spike and spike-wave activity, as well as wide slow wave (2-7 Hz) activity areas. Craniotomy under analgesia and aware sedation conditions is carried out. Intrasurgery cortical electric stimulation assisted by neuronavigator causes a limited partial complex seizure which the patient recognizes to be exactly like his. Thus, MEG localization of the epileptogenic area is confirmed. Surgical resection of both the lesion and the epileptogenic area is carried out. The patient remains free from seizures 9 months after surgery. A control MEG study reveals no epileptogenic nor slow wave activity.
in this particular case, MEG has proven to be a useful presurgical evaluation technique to localize epileptogenic activity, validated by intrasurgical cortical stimulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12495644/

Until now when propofol was administered by a single bolus, how to define the optimal individual dose and to assess its hypnotic effect have not been clearly studied. The goal of this study is to develop an artificial neural network model to predict the hypnotic effect of propofol on the basis of common clinical parameters. Ten parameters were chosen as the input factors based on the related literatures and clinical experiences.

Sevoflurane is a non-irritant and acts quickly so induction is usually calm. However, inhalation induction with high concentrations of sevoflurane can cause convulsion-like movements and seizure-like changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Little is known about the EEG during maintenance of anaesthesia with sevoflurane, so we planned a prospective trial of sevoflurane maintenance after i.v. induction with benzodiazepine and barbiturate, which is another common induction technique in children.
EEG recordings were made before premedication with midazolam (0.1 mg kg(-1) i.v.), during induction of anaesthesia with thiopental (5 mg kg(-1)), and during maintenance with sevoflurane (2% end-tidal concentration in air/oxygen without nitrous oxide) in 30 generally healthy, 3- to 8-year-old children having adenoids removed. Noise-free EEG data of good quality were successfully recorded from all 30 children.

We studied the effect of esmolol on the bispectral index scale (BIS), which is a processed EEG recently introduced to monitor depth of anaesthesia.
We gave esmolol 80 mg to 30 healthy male patients after induction of anaesthesia using propofol, with either fentanyl (group 1) or placebo (group 2). Patients were ventilated mechanically through a laryngeal mask airway and anaesthesia was maintained using propofol to keep the BIS value between 55 and 60.
Esmolol did not affect the BIS index value in either group.

Fifty patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy received combined epidural and general anesthesia or general anesthesia alone with isoflurane and alfentanil. Isoflurane was administered by computer-controlled closed-loop feedback to maintain an EEG 95% spectral edge frequency of 17.5 Hz, a target chosen on the basis of a pilot study. In epidural patients, end-tidal isoflurane concentration (FE'(ISO)) was 0.19% smaller (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.32% to -0.06%; P < 0.01), mean arterial blood pressure was 17 mm Hg lower (95% CI, -24 to -9 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), and body temperature was 0.4 degrees C lower (95% CI, -0.7 to 0 degrees C; P < 0.05) than in controls. EEG bispectral index (BIS) was 4 points higher (95% CI, 1 to 7; P < 0.05). EEG median frequency and heart rate were similar in both groups. Epidural patients were 76% more likely (95% CI, 58% to 94%; P < 0.001) to require metaraminol for hypotension and were 28% more likely (95% CI, 3% to 53%; P < 0.05) to require glycopyrrolate for bradycardia. After surgery, the time to eye opening in epidural patients was 2.3 min shorter (95% CI, -4.2 to -0.5 min; P < 0.05). Time to eye opening correlated better with FE'(ISO) in the last 30 s of anesthesia (FE'(ISO) = 0.07 x time to eye opening + 0.31; r(2) = 0.59; P < 0.0001) than with BIS from the same period (BIS = 64 - 1.25 x time to eye opening; r(2) = 0.22; P < 0.001) (P < 0.0001). To maintain similar intraoperative spectral edge frequency, patients receiving combined epidural and general anesthesia require 21% less isoflurane than those receiving general anesthesia alone. This smaller isoflurane dose is associated with faster emergence from anesthesia.

Blood samples were collected up to 12 h post-infusion. Plasma concentrations of midazolam and of its two metabolites, 1'-OHM and 4-OHM, were assessed using an h.p.l.c.-MS method (LOQ 0.5 ng ml-1 for each analyte). Vital signs, cardiac parameters and oximetry were monitored. Local tolerance was determined and adverse events were also monitored.
After s.c. infusion t(max) and C(max) were 0.51 +/- 0.18 h and 127.8 +/- 29.3 ng ml-1 (mean +/- s.d.), respectively. No statistically significant difference was detected in AUC(0, infinity ) after i.v. and s.c. administration.

A randomized, double-blind, cross over study of 12 healthy male volunteers. Subjects orally received capsules with 255-285 mg St John's wort extract (900 micro g hypericin content), 25 mg amitriptyline and placebo three times daily for periods of 14 days each with at least 14 days between. The doses of amitriptyline and St John's wort extract are comparable with respect to their antidepressant activity. Compliance was confirmed by coadministration of 10 mg of riboflavin with each capsule and detection of urinary vitamin B2 on treatment day 11 with high performance liquid chromatography. Measurements of heart rate variability, psychometric tests and qEEG were performed before start of medication and repeatedly on the last treatment day.
St John's wort extract did not affect heart rate variability (HRV) whereas amitripytline significantly decreased it: the difference in the percentage number of adjacent RR intervals> 50 ms (pNN50) was 8.6 (-2.6, 19.9; mean; 95% confidence interval) between St John's wort extract and placebo and -17.6 (-24.7, -10.4) between amitriptyline and placebo. Neither St John's wort extract nor amitriptyline had an influence on cognitive performance such as choice reaction, psychomotor coordination, short-term memory and responsiveness to distractive stimuli. Amitriptyline but not St John's wort extract decreased self rated activity (P < 0.05). Both drugs caused significant qEEG changes. St John's wort extract increased theta power density. Amitriptyline increased theta as well as fast alpha power density.
Multiple doses of St John's wort extract do not affect heart rate variability nor cognitive function. Chronic administration of amitriptyline causes a decrement of HRV and subjective sedation but it does not impair cognitive performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12236848/

Based on the obtained results, we developed a method for automatic segmentation, classification and compact presentation of burst suppression patterns.
The spectral analysis was performed with the short time Fourier transform and with autoregressive modeling to provide information of frequency contents of bursts. This information was used when designing appropriate filters for segmentation algorithms. The adaptive segmentation was carried out using two different nonparametric methods. The first one was based on the absolute values of amplitudes and is referred to as the ADIF method. The second method used the absolute values of the Nonlinear Energy Operator (NLEO) and is referred to as the NLEO method. Both methods have been described earlier but they were modified for the purposes of BSP detection. The signal was classified to bursts, suppressions and artifacts. Automatic classification was compared with manual classification. Results. The NLEO method was more accurate, especially in the detection of artifacts. NLEO method classified correctly 94.0% of the propofol data and 92.8% of the thiopental data. With the ADIF method, the results were 90.5% and 88.1% respectively.
Our results show that burst suppression caused by the different anesthetics can be reliably detected with our segmentation and classification methods. The analysis of normal and pathological EEG, however, should include information of the anesthetic used. Knowledge of the normal variation of the EEG is necessary in order to detect the abnormal BSP of, for instance, seizure patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12212991/

For example, it was shown that so-called bispectral indices can be used to assess the depth of sedation. The methods applied so far are based on interval-related procedures of bispectral analysis. Consequently, the use of the resulting parameters for on-line monitoring or investigations of signal properties during transition periods, e.g., when entering burst-suppression periods, is restricted. The objective of this paper is to provide the methodological basis for a time-continuous (on-line) investigation of quadratic phase coupling induced by amplitude modulation.
To accomplish this aim an algorithm is presented which enables the analysis of the temporal development in the degree of amplitude modulation (DAM), e.g., during the transition to burst-suppression periods in patients with severe neurological diseases.
It was found that these periods are associated with increasing DAM compared with the baseline conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12212990/

The methods are compared with those of the more commonly used anesthetic sodium amobarbital (Amytal).
Despite differences between the methohexital and amobarbital test protocols, the behavioral and neurologic effects of the two anesthetics are similar. Because of the brief duration of methohexital, two successive injections are made on each side rather than one, to lengthen the time available for testing both language and memory. Behavioral and EEG indices return to baseline more quickly and more completely with methohexital than with amobarbital, allowing several repetitions of the procedure without incremental drowsiness, and the total time taken for the procedure is less with methohexital than with amobarbital.
The results of language and memory testing in the Wada test are equivalent for amobarbital and methohexital, except that methohexital has a briefer duration of action and is associated with less sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12199731/

A third expression of memory (unconscious-controlled memory) was recently observed after moderate to light sedation (BIS, 70-80). The present study investigated memory function during deep sedation (BIS, 60-70). As memory effects are small, the authors studied potential predictors of individual differences in memory performance.
Memory function and speed of information processing were assessed in 56 outpatients before surgery. During propofol anesthesia supplemented with alfentanil, patients heard a series of words while anesthesia was titrated to BIS, 60-70. In between words, response to command was assessed using the Isolated Forearm Technique. The authors tested memory with a word stem completion task and process dissociation procedure to distinguish explicit from implicit effects.
Mean (+/- SD) BIS during word presentation was 64.0 +/- 3. Patients with conscious recall of verbal commands (n = 9) did not recall or recognize presented words. Even so, the process dissociation procedure revealed evidence of memory by a significantly higher hit rate in the inclusion condition (0.26) than in the exclusion condition (0.12). Patients without conscious recall showed no evidence of memory for presented words. Hit scores correlated significantly with scores in the preoperative memory test (r = 0.35).
The authors found evidence of weak explicit memory function during anesthesia titrated to BIS, 60-70. The observations strongly suggest that postoperative memory relates to awareness during anesthesia, but the nature of this relation remains unclear. Memory seems more likely in patients with good preoperative memory performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12151928/

Many surgeons selectively or routinely use electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring as well as shunting when performing this operation.
We conducted this retrospective study to assess the maximum carotid clamp time without shunting or EEG monitoring during a CEA without the development of neurological deficits in an already compromised cerebral circulation.
Fifteen consecutive patients who underwent CEAs between 1988 and 1999 met our criteria of angiographically documented ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis with contralateral ICA occlusion. The patient presentations included asymptomatic (14%), transient ischemic attack (TIA) (50%), and stroke (36%). All patients were operated under general anesthesia without shunting and only 4 patients underwent EEG monitoring. On angiography, all 15 patients had ipsilateral ICA stenosis (70-99%) and contralateral occlusion. In 54% of patients, the vertebral arteries (VAs) were both patent, while in 46% of patients only 1 VA was patent. Eighty-five percent of patients had at least 1 patent anterior communicating (Pcomm) artery, while 15% had nonvisualized Pcomm arteries bilaterally. Of the 15 patients, 14 had a patent anterior communicating artery. The mean clamp time of the CCA was 18.5 minutes (range 14-30 minutes). None of the 15 patients had new neurological changes immediately postoperatively or during the 6 weeks of follow-up.
We propose that shunting may not be necessary during CEA for high-grade stenosis with contralateral ICA occlusion, presumably because of adequate distal small vessel collaterals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12128306/
12102248,Use of the BIS monitor to detect onset of naturally occurring sleep.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2002,"Tung A, Lynch JP, Roizen MF","Inadvertent sleep episodes are a recognized complication of sleep deprivation. Although such events can be life threatening, no system currently exists to detect and prevent sleep onset. Because sleep shares electroencephalographic similarities with the anesthetized state, we hypothesized that the BIS monitor, a currently available EEG-based monitor of anesthetic depth, would detect the onset of physiologic sleep. To test our hypothesis, we monitored volunteers during the transition from waking to sleep.
Non-medicated volunteers were asked to lie down in a dark room for 30-minutes and fall asleep while attached to a BIS monitor located outside the room. A laptop computer was used to generate an audio tone inside the room. Speaker volume was adjusted to the lowest level detectable by the awake subject. Testing was begun by activating a computer to play a tone at random intervals. The subject was instructed to click a mouse connected to the computer upon hearing the tone to verify wakefulness. The session was terminated upon loss of response to three consecutive tones or after 30 minutes. Subjects were questioned afterwards regarding their perceptions of sleep during testing.
11 out of 28 self-described good sleepers could not sleep under testing conditions. BIS values for the remaining 17 fell from 96.4 +/- 2.1 to 86.5 +/- 0.79 (p < 0.01) upon sleep onset. All subjects responded to audio stimuli at BIS values >90, and were asleep either by subjective or objective report at BIS values <80. Three subjects retained the mouse-click response despite low BIS scores and subjective descriptions of sleep.
Although variability in the BIS value marking sleep onset was noted, the BIS monitor detected all episodes of sleep onset in our testing regimen. We conclude that a threshold BIS value can be defined to allow the BIS monitor to detect sleep onset.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12102248/

The main parameters were eye movements, EEG, body sway, visual analogue scales and a cognitive test battery. Rizatriptan and sumatriptan decreased saccadic peak velocity by 18.3 (95% CI: 5.7, 30.8) and 15.0 (2.2, 27.9) degrees/sec, respectively, about half the decrease induced by temazepam (35.0 (22.1, 47.8) degrees/sec).

60 healthy adult patients (aged 20-50 yrs) scheduled for elective surgery with general anesthesia.
During a TCI of propofol (n = 30) or thiopental (n = 30), clinical endpoints for loss of verbal responsiveness (LOV), loss-of-eyelash reflex (LOE), occurrence of yawning, and apnea were assessed at 15-second intervals. In addition, BIS and C(E) values were recorded at each of the endpoints.
In both anesthetic groups, the sequence of occurrence of the clinical endpoints was similar, namely LOV, LOE, yawning, and, lastly, apnea. Compared with LOV and LOE, yawning was associated with lower BIS and higher C(E) values with both anesthetics. The frequency of yawning was higher with thiopental than propofol (83% vs. 63%, respectively). However, the frequency of apnea was higher with propofol than thiopental (77% vs. 53%, respectively).
The correlation of the clinical endpoints with BIS and C(E) values was highest for LOV. Yawning was as unreliable as LOE for determining the onset of unconsciousness during induction of anesthesia.

The present study investigates the use of a neural network technique to obtain a non-proprietary index of the depth of anaesthesia from the processed EEG data.
Two hundred patients, who underwent general abdominal surgery, were recruited for our trial. For anaesthesia we used a total i.v. technique, tracheal intubation, and artificial ventilation. Fourteen EEG variables, including the BIS, were extracted from the EEG, monitored with an EEG computerized monitor, and then stored on a computer. Data from 150 patients were used to train the neural network. All the variables, excluding the BIS, were used as input data in the neural network. The output targets of the network were provided by anaesthesia scores ranging from 10 to 100 assigned by the anaesthesiologist according to the observer's assessment of alertness and sedation (OAA/S) and other clinical means of assessing depth of anaesthesia. Data from the other 50 patients were used to test the model and for statistical analysis.
The artificial neural network was successfully trained to predict an anaesthesia depth index, the NED (neural network evaluated depth), ranging from 0 to 100. The correlation coefficient between the NED and the BIS over the test set was 0.94 (P<0.0001).

Thirty-four healthy pediatric patients between three to six years of age were enrolled in this institutionally approved study. All children required dental restorations and were uncooperative. The children received a routine oral sedation regimen used in our clinic consisting of chloral hydrate, meperidine, and hydroxyzine that varied in dose for each child. Intraoperatively, nitrous oxide/oxygen was also administered. Physiological variables including oxygen saturation, blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in compliance with AAPD sedation guidelines. The behavior and levels of sedation consistent with AAPD guidelines were also recorded. The BIS monitor was used to obtain EEG information.
Useful data were recorded from 21 patients. The mean age and weight of the children were 46.1 +/- 10 months and 16.1 +/- 5 kgs, respectively. The results show a significant association between observed patient behavior and the AAPD levels of sedation (chi2 = 105.1, df = 6, P< 0.0001), between levels of sedation and behavior as a function of 12 time-oriented periods during treatment, (chi2=41.90, df=22, P<0.005 and chi2=48.0, df=33, P=0.04, respectively) and between BIS readings as a function of both level of sedation and behavior (chi2=105.1, df=6, P<0.001 and chi2=28.5, df = 18, P< 0.05, respectively).
There appears to be a significant association between observed patient behaviors during sedation and levels of sedation as measured by BIS and AAPD sedation guidelines.

Previous studies of thiopental, a barbiturate similar to sodium amobarbital, found that age and gender significantly affect the dose required to induce anesthesia, such that younger patients require higher dosage.
A total of 55 patients who underwent the IAP procedure at Johns Hopkins Hospital were included in the study (110 hemispheric injections). The patient group included 30 female and 25 male patients, ranging in age from 11 to 50 years. To determine if a higher dose of sodium amobarbital was needed for younger patients during the IAP, we analyzed the time to return to preinjection EEG baseline status and time to return to 5/5 strength as a function of patient age and gender.
We found that younger patients (11-20 years old) returned to preinjection baseline EEG status and full (5/5) strength faster than older patients. No gender difference was found.

The spiked electrode consists of an array of microneedles penetrating the outer skin layers. We found a significant dependency of the electrode-skin-electrode impedance (ESEI) on the electrode size (i.e., the number of spikes) and the coating material of the spikes. Electrodes larger than 3 x 3 mm2 coated with Ag-AgCl have sufficiently low ESEI to be well suited for electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings. The maximum measured ESEI was 4.24 k(omega) and 87 k(omega), at 1 kHz and 0.6 Hz, respectively. The minimum ESEI was 0.65 k(omega) an 16 k(omega), at the same frequencies. The ESEI of spiked electrodes is stable over an extended period of time. The arithmetic mean of the generated dc offset voltage is 11.8 mV immediately after application on the skin and 9.8 mV after 20-30 min. A spectral study of the generated potential difference revealed that the ac part was unstable at frequencies below approximately 0.8 Hz. Thus, the signal does not interfere with a number of clinical applications using real-time EEG. Comparing raw EEG recordings of the spiked electrode with commercial Zipprep electrodes showed that both signals were similar. Due to the mechanical strength of the silicon microneedles and the fact that neither skin preparation nor electrolytic gel is required, use of the spiked electrode is convenient.

In 70 patients without epilepsy, SLP happened during induction in 24 (34%), during maintenance in two (3%), during emergence in 28 (40%), and was delayed in 16 (23%). Most frequent clinical presentations of SLP were generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 30 patients (43%), events presented as increased tone with twitching and rhythmic movements not perceived as generalized tonic-clonic seizures in 20 (36%), and involuntary movements in 11 (16%). Of 11 patients with epilepsy, seven (64%) had generalized tonic-clonic seizure during emergence. Of all 81 patients, 26 (32%) only had an EEG, and 12 (15%) only a neurologic consultation. SLP may happen in patients with or without epilepsy receiving propofol. The time point of the occurrence of SLP suggests that a change in cerebral concentration of propofol may be causal.

E, Statistical physics, plasmas, fluids, and related interdisciplinary topics",1999,"Steyn-Ross ML, Steyn-Ross DA, Sleigh JW, Liley DT","We present a model for the dynamics of a cerebral cortex in which inputs to neuronal assemblies are treated as random Gaussian fluctuations about a mean value. We incorporate the effect of general anesthetic agents on the cortex as a modulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter rate constant. Stochastic differential equations are derived for the state variable h(e), the average excitatory soma potential, coherent fluctuations of which are believed to be the source of scalp-measured electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Using this stochastic approach we derive a stationary (long-time limit) fluctuation spectrum for h(e). The model predicts that there will be three distinct stationary (equilibrium) regimes for cortical activity. In region I (""coma""), corresponding to a strong inhibitory anesthetic effect, h(e) is single valued, large, and negative, so that neuronal firing rates are suppressed. In region II for a zero or small anesthetic effect, h(e) can take on three values, two of which are stable; we label the stable solutions as ""active"" (enhanced firing) and ""quiescent"" (suppressed firing). For region III, corresponding to negative anesthetic (i.e., analeptic) effect, h(e) again becomes single valued, but is now small and negative, resulting in strongly elevated firing rates (""seizure""). If we identify region II as associated with the conscious state of the cortex, then the model predicts that there will be a rapid transit between the active-conscious and comatose unconscious states at a critical value of anesthetic concentration, suggesting the existence of phase transitions in the cortex. The low-frequency spectral power in the h(e) signal should increase strongly during the initial stage of anesthesia induction, before collapsing to much lower values after the transition into comatose-unconsciousness. These qualitative predictions are consistent with clinical measurements by Bührer et al. [Anaesthesiology 77, 226 (1992)], MacIver et al. [ibid. 84, 1411 (1996)], and Kuizenga et al. [Br. J. Anaesthesia 80, 725 (1998)]. This strong increase in EEG spectral power in the vicinity of the critical point is similar to the divergences observed during thermodynamic phase transitions. We show that the divergence in low-frequency power in our model is a natural consequence of the existence of turning points in the trajectory of stationary states for the cortex.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11970675/

The decision to shunt in these patients was made on the basis of neurologic changes only irrespective of EEG findings. This group was then compared to the 288 patients undergoing CEA under general anesthetic with EEG monitoring over the same period. EEG changes occurred in 7.4% of awake patients and 15.3% of asleep patients (p < 0.03). The rates of ipsilateral hemispheric changes were similar, but no awake patient manifested global EEG changes with clamping while 3.5% of patients under general anesthesia did (p < 0.04). Global, but not hemispheric, changes were correlated with systolic blood pressure variability during clamping. This implies that global EEG changes in anesthetized patients may be the result of the anesthetic technique itself, and that cervical block may in fact be cerebroprotective.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11904797/
11892502,Neuroanesthesia. Innovative techniques and monitoring.,Anesthesiology clinics of North America,2002,"Soriano SG, McCann ME, Laussen PC","Advances in neuromonitoring have provided insights into neurologic function during anesthesia. Despite the limitations and necessary caution when using intraoperative monitors to interpret neural function, these technologies have been definite steps in the right direction for assessing neural integrity and level of consciousness during anesthesia. The techniques discussed minimize the adverse sequelae of a variety of neurosurgical and orthopedic procedures, reducing the morbidity rates/risks in the perioperative period. Furthermore, it is likely that such monitoring will become a standard of care, similar to other monitoring standards such as pulse oximetry and capnography. Accurate and reliable monitoring is essential, and on-going large prospective studies comparing the processed EEG or evoked potential with definable end points in both adult and pediatric populations will be necessary. The use of monitoring, such as the BIS, may improve cost efficiency by reducing the total amount of drug used to maintain anesthesia, as well as enhance recovery. A danger in this process, however, is the potential for public opinion, outside regulatory bodies, or medico-legal implications to drive change and enforce standards of care before appropriate data are available.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11892502/
11873028,The influence of remifentanil on the dynamic relationship between sevoflurane and surrogate anesthetic effect measures derived from the EEG.,Anesthesiology,2002,"Olofsen E, Sleigh JW, Dahan A","The authors modeled the influence of remifentanil on the dynamics of sevoflurane using three parameters derived from the electroencephalogram: 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), canonical univariate parameter (CUP), and Bispectral Index (BIS).
Thirty-six patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I or II were recruited, of which 12 received a target remifentanil concentration of 0 ng/ml, eight 2 ng/ml, eight 4 ng/ml, and another eight 8 ng/ml. Next (before surgery), several step-wise changes in the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (F(ET,sevo)) were performed. A data acquisition system simultaneously recorded F(ET,sevo), the raw electroencephalogram, BIS, and SEF. The authors used a combination of an effect compartment and an inhibitory sigmoid E(MAX) model to describe the relation between F(ET,sevo) and BIS, SEF, and CUP. Model parameters (t(1/2)k(e0), E(MAX), E(MIN), C(50), gamma, CUP weight factors) were estimated using the population data analysis program NONMEM. Significant remifentanil model parameter dependencies (P < 0.01) were determined.
Determined from SEF, remifentanil had no effect on t(1/2)k(e0) (1.91 +/- 0.26 min [mean +/- standard error]) but caused an increase in C(50) (baseline = 1.48 +/- 0.12%; 80% increase at 8 ng/ml) and decrease in E(MIN) (baseline = 10.8 +/- 0.6 Hz; 80% reduction at 8 ng/ml). Determined from CUP, remifentanil caused a dose-dependent decrease in t(1/2)k(e0) (baseline = 4.31 +/- 1.00 min; 60% decrease at 8 ng/ml), with no effect on C(50) (baseline = 0.88 +/- 0.13%). Determined from BIS, remifentanil caused a dose-dependent decrease in t(1/2)k(e0) (baseline value = 3.11 +/- 0.32 min; 40% decrease at 8 ng/ml), without affecting C(50) (baseline = 1.12 +/- 0.05%). Median R(2) values of the pooled data set were 0.815 for SEF, 0.933 for CUP (P < 0.01 vs. SEF), and 0.952 for BIS (P < 0.01 vs. SEF and CUP). Addition of remifentanil increased the R(2) values for CUP only.
Remifentanil accelerates sevoflurane blood-brain equilibration without affecting its hypnotic potency as determined from BIS and CUP. In terms of R(2), the authors' pharmacodynamic model describes the anesthetic-BIS relation best.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11873028/
11863328,Variation in surgical and anaesthetic technique and associations with operative risk in the European carotid surgery trial: implications for trials of ancillary techniques.,European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,2002,"Bond R, Warlow CP, Naylor AR, Rothwell PM, ","several ancillary surgical techniques, such as shunting and patching, are used in association with carotid endarterectomy. However, the balance of risks and benefits of these techniques is uncertain because of the lack of large randomised controlled trials (RCTs). To assess the potential for further trials, we studied the variation in use of these techniques by surgeon and by country in the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST).
use of each ancillary technique was assessed by surgeon and by country. For each technique, the relationships between the use of the technique and baseline patient characteristics, use of other techniques, and the 30-day operative risk of stroke and death were determined.
there was considerable variation between surgeons in the use of ancillary operative techniques both within (p<0.001 for shunting and patching), and between countries (p<0.001 for shunting and patching). Some surgeons used techniques selectively, and so the characteristics of patients differed depending on which techniques were used. Use of each technique was also significantly associated with the use of other techniques. Multiple regression analysis, taking into account all these factors, found no statistically significant associations between operative risk and the use of shunting, patching, intra-operative EEG monitoring, or type of anaesthetic. The only surgical technique significantly associated with an increased operative risk was not using intra-operative anticoagulation (hazard ratio=2.33, 95% CI=1.4-4.2). Other factors associated with an increased risk were an operation time of less than 1 h, or greater than 1.5 h, and the surgeons' subjective assessment that the operation was difficult.
in the ECST, operative risk was more closely related to patient characteristics, length of surgery, and the surgeons' perception of the difficulty of the operation, than to the use of particular ancillary operative techniques. The considerable variation between surgeons, and between countries, in the use of ancillary techniques is in keeping with the lack of convincing data from RCTs, and suggests that there should be sufficient uncertainty to make large pragmatic trials possible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11863328/

It is associated with a high incidence of brain damage and mental retardation as a consequence of repeated episodes of hypoglycaemia. Subtotal to near total pancreatectomy is indicated as a matter of urgency to decrease the amount of circulating insulin. The perioperative management of a 45-day-old, 5 kg male infant with hyperinsulinaemia (nesidioblastosis) is described. He had a history of generalized tonic clonic seizures 4 h after birth. The blood sugar at that time was 0.66 mmol x l(-1) (12 mg x dl(-1)) and serum calcium was 2.4 mmol x l(-1) (9.82 mg x dl(-1)). The insulin : glucose ratio was 1.6 (normal < 0.4). Occasional episodes of hypoglycaemia persisted in spite of medical line of management with intravenous dextrose 12%, 2 h gastric tube feeds, hydrocortisone (5 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) i.v.) and oral diazoxide 10 mg x kg(-1), 8 h for 3 weeks. A CT scan and USG did not reveal any abnormality of the pancreas. However, the EEG varied from one of abnormally low amplitude to an isoelectric record.

A comparison with bispectral index monitoring during propofol-remifentanil-anaesthesia.,Der Anaesthesist,2001,"Kreuer S, Biedler A, Larsen R, Schoth S, Altmann S, Wilhelm W","The Narcotrend is a new EEG monitor designed to measure the depth of anaesthesia based on a 6-letter classification from A (awake) to F (general anaesthesia with increasing burst suppression) and divided into 14 substages (A, B0-2, C0-2, D0-2, E0,1, F0,1). This study was designed to investigate the assessment of the depth of anaesthesia as measured by the Narcotrend in comparison with bispectral index monitoring (BIS).
Both BIS and Narcotrend EEG electrodes were positioned on the patient's forehead as recommended by the manufacturers. All patients were premedicated with diazepam 0.15 mg/kg orally in the evening and on the morning before surgery. Induction of anaesthesia was started with a remifentanil infusion at 0.4 microgram/kg/min; 5 min later propofol was given for hypnosis using a target-controlled infusion initially started at 3.5 micrograms/ml. After loss of consciousness patients received 1.2 mg/kg of suxamethonium. Immediately after intubation, remifentanil was reduced to 0.2 microgram/kg/min, and the depth of anaesthesia was adjusted according to clinical needs by regulating the propofol target-controlled-infusion. BIS values and Narcotrend stages were recorded as data pairs in intervals of 1 min during anaesthetic induction and emergence, and in intervals of 5 min during maintenance of anaesthesia.
Fifty patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery were studied and 2031 data pairs were obtained. An increasing depth of anaesthesia as indicated by the Narcotrend was associated with significantly lower mean BIS values. With BIS values between 100 and 85 (representing awake patients), 95.5% of all data pairs indicated a Narcotrend stage A or B. In case the BIS was found to be 65-40 (representing general anaesthesia) the corresponding Narcotrend stages were measured as D (52.4%) or E (41.1%). No patient complained of intraoperative recall when interviewed on the 1st and 3rd postoperative day.
We could demonstrate that an increase of the hypnotic component of anaesthesia as indicated by BIS is accompanied by corresponding effects as displayed by the Narcotrend during propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia. The Narcotrend stages D or E are assumed equivalent to BIS values between 64 and 40 indicating general anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11824075/
11812701,Electrocardiographic electrodes provide the same results as expensive special sensors in the routine monitoring of anesthetic depth.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2002,"Hemmerling TM, Harvey P","The Bispectral Index (BIS) is a mathematically derived electroencephalographic (EEG) derivative that has been introduced to monitor depth of anesthesia (1,2). The A-2000 BIS monitoring system (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Newton, MA) is currently the only commercially available system to monitor depth of anesthesia. In several studies, its propensity to optimize the use of hypnotics to maintain and achieve a certain depth of anesthesia has been described (3,4). Some studies have even proposed that the routine use of the monitoring system can decrease awareness (1,5), an increasing factor in malpractice claims. The cost-benefit calculations for BIS monitoring suffer from the fact that like its predecessor, the 1000-A BIS monitor, the A-2000 BIS monitoring system demands the use of expensive, special electrodes (6). Although the application of the single-use BIS sensor is very comfortable and easy to use, its high price of approximately $10-20 US prevents many anesthesiologists from using it. Furthermore, whereas the former model of the monitor (1000-A BIS monitor; Aspect Medical Systems, Inc.) used standardized connectors, which allowed the use of other electrodes such as electrocardiogram (ECG), the new monitoring system makes this very difficult because of special connectors that match the equivalent connector at the proximal BIS sensor site. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare BIS values derived from the original BIS sensor with BIS values derived from commercially available ECG electrodes. This comparison was made possible by designing and manufacturing a connector allowing the use of ECG electrodes.
The Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor adequately monitors depth of anesthesia. The routine use of this monitor has been hampered by the benefit-cost equation because only special expensive electrodes can be used. We examined the agreement of BIS values obtained by original sensor electrodes and commercial electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes. These ECG electrodes can replace more expensive BIS sensors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11812701/
11771598,Propofol anaesthesia via target controlled infusion or manually controlled infusion: effects on the bispectral index as a measure of anaesthetic depth.,Anaesthesia and intensive care,2001,"Gale T, Leslie K, Kluger M","Target controlled infusions (TCI) of propofol allow anaesthetists to target constant blood concentrations and respond promptly to signs of inappropriate anaesthetic depth. Studies comparing propofol TCI with manually controlled infusion (MCI) reported similar control of anaesthesia, but did not use an objective measure of anaesthetic depth. We therefore tested whether the Bispectral Index (BIS), an electroencephalographic (EEG) variable, is more stable during propofol TCI or MCI. Forty patients received midazolam and fentanyl before induction and were randomized to TCI or MCI. Target propofol concentrations in the TCI group were 3 to 8 microg/ml. The MCI group received propofol bolus (approximately 2 mg/kg) and infusion (3 to 10 mg/kg/h). Neuromuscular blockade was achieved with rocuronium. Following endotracheal intubation, nitrous oxide (66%) in oxygen was delivered and propofol infusion and fentanyl boluses were titrated against clinical signs. Blood pressure, heart rate and EEG were recorded, although the anaesthetist was blind to BIS values. The ideal BIS for general anaesthesia was defined as 50. Performance error, absolute performance error, wobble and divergence of BIS, and maximum changes in blood pressure and heart rate were compared using two-sample t-tests or rank-sum tests where appropriate. There was no difference in absolute performance errors during maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol TCI or MCI (23 +/- 11% vs 23 +/- 9%; P=0.97). The two groups did not differ significantly in performance error, wobble, divergence on haemodynamic changes. We conclude that TCI and MCI result in similar depth of anaesthesia and haemodynamic stability when titrated against traditional clinical signs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11771598/
11762264,Benzodiazepines in the intensive care unit.,Critical care clinics,2001,"Young CC, Prielipp RC","The effects of BZ drugs result from interaction at the GABAA receptor within the CNS, producing anxiolysis, hypnosis, and amnesia in a dose-dependent fashion. These sedative effects are best titrated to reproducible clinical endpoints, using scoring systems such as the Ramsay scale. All BZs exhibit similar pharmacologic effects, but the important differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics should be recognized to use these drugs safely and effectively within the ICU. Diazepam is the classic anxiolytic, amnestic, and sedative agent, but the presence of long-acting active metabolites that depend on the kidneys for elimination limits its use in many ICU patients. Lorazepam is the most potent BZ used in the ICU; it has stable pharmacokinetics and relatively low cost. This drug is best reserved for situations in which rapid onset is not essential and long-term sedation is anticipated. Midazolam has the shortest t1/2 of the commonly used BZs, generates few active metabolites, and is water soluble at physiologic pH. Thus, it is well suited for continuous infusion in the ICU, and the recent introduction of generic formulations of midazolam has decreased the drug-acquisition cost for many hospitals. Optimal sedation for ICU patients often requires BZ and concomitant therapy with drugs such as haloperidol, dexmedetomidine, opioids, and so forth, to reduce untoward side effects and, perhaps, overall drug costs. Flumazenil, a specific BZ antagonist, can be used for diagnostic or therapeutic reversal of BZ agonists when appropriate. Most experienced intensivists recommend an individualized approach to sedation and titration of anxiolysis to maximize efficacy, minimize side effects, and optimize cost effectiveness in the ICU. New CNS monitors of the EEG, such as the BIS or entropy EEG monitors, may refine titration algorithms further in the near future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11762264/

Twenty-seven patients undergoing vascular surgery were studied under general anesthesia with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, or desflurane. The EEG was recorded continuously during the procedure and patients' anesthesia states were assessed according to the responsiveness component of the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score. An OAA/S score of zero or one was considered asleep and two or greater was considered awake. Complexity of the EEG was quantitatively estimated by the measure C(n), whose performance in discriminating awake and asleep states was analyzed by statistics for different anesthetic techniques and different patient populations. Compared with other measures, such as approximate entropy, spectral entropy, and median frequency, C(n) not only demonstrates better performance (93% accuracy) across all of the patients, but also is an easier algorithm to implement for real-time use. The study shows that C(n) is a very useful and promising EEG-derived parameter for characterizing the (DOA) under clinical situations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11759923/

In this study, the authors compared the artifact robustness and the interindividual and intraindividual baseline stability of several univariate descriptors of the electroencephalogram (Shannon entropy, approximate entropy, spectral edge frequency 95, delta ratio, and canonical univariate parameter).
Electroencephalographic data of 16 healthy volunteers before and after administration of an intravenous bolus of propofol (2 mg/kg body weight) were analyzed. Each volunteer was studied twice. The baseline electroencephalogram was recorded for a median of 18 min before drug administration. For each electroencephalographic descriptor, the authors calculated the following: (1) baseline variability (= (median baseline - median effect) [i.e., signal]/SD baseline [i.e., noise]) without artifact rejection; (2) baseline variability with artifact rejection; and (3) baseline stability within and between individuals (= (median baseline - median effect) averaged over all volunteers/SD of all median baselines).
Without artifact rejection, Shannon entropy and canonical univariate parameter displayed the highest signal-to-noise ratio. After artifact rejection, approximate entropy, Shannon entropy, and the canonical univariate parameter displayed the highest signal-to-noise ratio. Baseline stability within and between individuals was highest for approximate entropy.
With regard to robustness against artifacts, the electroencephalographic entropy parameters and the canonical univariate parameter were superior to spectral edge frequency 95 and delta ratio.

Changes in cerebral glucose metabolism may be an early postnatal indicator of fetal asphyxia. The objective is to develop an experimental lamb model involving the transition from fetal to neonatal life and to examine the effect of fetal asphyxia with cerebral hypoxic ischemia on early postnatal cerebral glucose metabolism. Fetal asphyxia was induced by total umbilical cord occlusion in eight near-term fetal lambs (134-138 days) with the ewe under isoflurane-opiate anesthesia. The mean occlusion time until cardiac arrest was 14.5 (4.2) min (SD). Lambs were immediately delivered and standardized resuscitation was instituted after 2 min asystole. At 4 hr postnatal age, [18-F]Fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (18-FDG) was injected intravenously in eight asphyxiated lambs and in eight controls. Cerebral glucose metabolism was examined by positron emission tomography (PET). As a result the mean arterial blood pressure, acid-base values, blood glucose and serum lactate at 4 hr postnatal age did not differ significantly between lambs subjected to umbilical cord occlusion and controls. EEG was abnormal in all lambs subjected to cord occlusion and normal in the controls at 4 hr postnatal age. Global cerebral metabolic rate (CMRgl) as determined by PET was significantly lower in lambs subjected to cord occlusion mean/median (SD) 22.2/19.6 (8.4) micromol/min/100 g) than in controls mean/median (SD) 37.8/35.9 (6.1); P < 0.01).

This study was designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of urapidil, as an alternative to labetalol, in preventing the hemodynamic response of ECT. Twenty-seven patients undergoing a series of six consecutive ECT treatments were studied. Each patient received all three pretreatments twice: no drug, labetalol 0.2 mg/kg, or urapidil 25 mg. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were recorded during the awake state, after anesthesia induction, and 1, 2, 5, 10 and 30 minutes after electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure ended. The duration of the EEG convulsion was also recorded. After induction, the HR increased for no drug and urapidil pretreatments, whereas it decreased when labetalol was given. Labetalol and urapidil attenuated the peak increase of blood pressure and returned it to earlier baseline values. There were no differences in the duration of EEG convulsion between the three pretreatments.

The aim of this study was to determine which derivations distinguish the best between patients requiring a shunt and patients who do not need a shunt. Four predefined frequency bands and two regimens for general anesthesia (isoflurane versus propofol) were used. EEG data (16 channels) were obtained from 152 EEGs recorded during carotid endarterectomy. Analog EEG signals of preclamp and clamp periods of 100 seconds were digitized to compute power spectra. Changes in power during clamping were calculated for all possible derivations in four predefined frequency bands and were expressed as Z-scores. For each derivation, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated. Derivations with the greatest area under the receiver operating characteristics curve were considered to distinguish the best between the shunt and the nonshunt groups formed in retrospect on the basis of consensus between three independent and experienced board-certified electroencephalographers. The two different anesthetic regimens resulted in different patterns of EEG changes because of clamping.

To compare the effects of reboxetine on cognitive and autonomic functions with those of placebo in healthy humans.
A randomised, double-blind, crossover study of 12 healthy male volunteers aged 25 (21-27; median, range) years. Subjects orally received 4 mg reboxetine and placebo twice daily for periods of 14 days each with at least 14 days in between. Vasoconstrictory response of cutaneous vessels (VR) and skin conductance response (SCR) following sudden deep breath were employed as parameters for autonomic function. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) and psychometric tests served as parameters for cognitive function.
Reboxetine decreased SCR and prolonged the dilation phase of VR (P<0.05). It did not affect cognitive functions such as flicker fusion frequency, choice reaction, memory and psychomotor coordination but increased slow beta (beta1) power density in the qEEG. Tiredness (n=12), dry mouth (n=9), delayed urination (n=3) and constipation (n=1) were noted with reboxetine.
Sustained peripheral and/or central sympathetic activation accounts for the prolongation of VR. The decrease of SCR and typical side effects suggest a relevant antimuscarinic drug action. Chronic administration of reboxetine at therapeutic doses causes autonomic dysfunction and subjective sedation but does not impair cognitive and psychomotor abilities in healthy humans.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11594447/

Prospective, observational study.
Medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university-affiliated teaching hospital.
Thirty-one awake, unsedated critically ill adults were assessed in 108 separate sessions.
In each session, severity of illness was assessed by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE III). The APACHE III Acute Physiology Score was used to quantify the degree of physiologic derangement. Neurologic function was assessed using the APACHE III Neurologic Score, the Glasgow Coma Scale, the Reaction Level Scale, and the Modified Ramsay Sedation Scale. All indices were plotted against various spectral parameters of the EEG, including BIS, an empirical index of EEG activity that is scaled from 0 to 100. BIS was significantly (p <.05) correlated with neurologic score regardless of scoring system used and was more strongly correlated than any other EEG spectral parameter. Better neurologic function was associated with higher values of BIS. In multivariate analysis, the combination of BIS and relative power in the theta band of the EEG accounted for 38% of the variability in the Glasgow Coma Scale.
BIS provides a reliable index of neurologic status in awake, unsedated, critically ill patients. Further research is needed to determine whether the effects of neurologic status and pharmacologic sedation upon EEG are additive, whether BIS can be used to assess pharmacologic sedation in the critically ill patient population, and whether such objective measures of neurologic status have prognostic value.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11588470/

We thus evaluated the influence of clonidine on the bispectral index (BIS) and its potential dose-sparing effect on propofol. After induction of anaesthesia with target-controlled infusion of propofol and obtaining an unchanged bispectral index (pre-BIS), clonidine 4 microg kg(-1) or placebo was administered randomly to 50 patients in a double-blind manner. Subsequently, if there was a decrease in BIS we reduced the target concentration of propofol until pre-BIS was reached. The pre-BIS was maintained and a remifentanil infusion was added during surgery. The courses of the BIS, heart rate and blood pressure were recorded and the total amounts of intra-operative propofol and remifentanil were determined. Assessment of implicit memory during anaesthesia was performed with an auditory implicit memory test consisting of item sequences. Administration of clonidine resulted in a decrease in the BIS from 45 (SD 4) to 40 (6) (P<0.001), which allowed a reduction of propofol target concentration from 3.3 (0.6) to 2.7 (0.7) microg ml(-1) (P<0.001) and measured propofol concentration from 2.9 (0.6) to 2.5 (0.7) kg ml(-1) (P=0.009) in order to maintain the pre-BIS value. During subsequent surgery, propofol requirements were reduced by 20% (P=0.002) in the clonidine group and a similar amount of remifentanil was used in each group. The increase in anaesthetic depth given by clonidine can therefore be measured with bispectral EEG analysis and allows reduction of the propofol dose to achieve a specific depth of anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11575336/
11573582,Monitoring level of sedation with bispectral EEG analysis: comparison between hypothermic and normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.,British journal of anaesthesia,2001,"Schmidlin D, Hager P, Schmid ER","The level of sedation of 28 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting with fentanyl-propofol anaesthesia was monitored with bispectral analysis (BIS), spectral edge frequency, and band power of the electroencephalogram. Fourteen patients underwent hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (32 degrees C, group H), and 14 normothermic CPB (group N). The level of sedation was measured with Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Score and with Ramsay Sedation Score. BIS was the only EEG measurement that paralleled the clinical course of the patients' sedation level. Values (median, 95% confidence intervals (CI)) changed significantly over time in both groups (P<0.0001). In group H, BIS decreased from 97 (95, 99) the day before surgery to 48 (44, 52) after tracheal intubation, to 46 (41, 52) before going off CPB, to 91 (85, 97) immediately before extubation. In group N, values were 93 (91, 97) the day before surgery, 53 (47, 59) after tracheal intubation, 48 (43, 53) before going off CPB, and 90 (84, 96) before extubation. During CPB, BIS values were significantly different between the two groups. Group H had a median of 41 (95% CI, 39, 42), and group N had a median of 49 (95% CI, 48, 51, P<0.0001). Peak values of all other processed EEG parameters during anaesthesia and surgery overlapped with values from the day before, when patients had no sedating medication, and these values did not correlate to the patients' course of sedation during the study. There was no explicit recall of the surgery in either group. During the phases of anaesthesia and surgery without CPB, the progression of BIS levels was comparable with previously published data for non-cardiac surgery. During normothermic CPB, the highest BIS values were close to values representing insufficient depth of sedation. It remains to be elucidated whether the much lower BIS values in the hypothermic group were solely a result of brain cooling or if increased serum propofol concentrations, because of slowed pharmacodynamics during hypothermia, also contributed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11573582/

Newborn infants suffering from neonatal encephalopathy often ventilate spontaneously and are not necessarily sedated. We aimed to test whether mild posthypoxic HT lasting 24 h was neuroprotective if the animals were not sedated. Thirty-nine piglets (median weight 1.6 kg, range 0.8-2.2 kg; median age 24 h, range 7-48 h) were anesthetized and ventilated and subjected to a 45-min hypoxic (FiO(2) approximately 6%) global insult (n = 36) or sham hypoxia (n = 3). On reoxygenation, 18 were maintained normothermic (NT, 39.0 degrees C) for 72 h, and 21 were cooled from 39 (NT) to 35 degrees C (HT) for the first 24 h before NT was resumed (18 experimental, three sham hypoxia). Cardiovascular parameters and intermittent EEG were documented throughout. The brain was perfusion fixed for neuropathology and five main areas examined using light microscopy. The insult severity (duration in minutes of EEG amplitude < 7 microV) was similar in the NT and HT groups, mean +/- SD (28 +/- 7.2 versus 27 +/- 8.6 min), as was the mean FiO(2) (5.9 +/- 0.7 versus 5.8 +/- 0.8%) during the insult. Six NT and seven HT piglets developed posthypoxic seizures that lasted 29 and 30% of the time, respectively. The distribution and degree of injury (0.0-4.0, normal-maximal damage) within the brain (hippocampus, cortex/white matter, cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus) were similar in the NT and HT groups (overall score, mean +/- SD, 2.3 +/- 1.5 versus 2.4 +/- 1.3) as was the EEG background amplitude at 3 h (13 +/- 3.5 versus 10 +/- 3.3 microV). The HT animals shivered and were more active. The sham control group (n = 3) shivered but had normal physiology and neuropathology. Plasma cortisol was significantly higher in the HT group during the HT period, 766 +/- 277 versus 244 +/- 144 microM at 24 h. Mild postinsult HT for 24 h was not neuroprotective in unsedated piglets and did not reduce the number of animals that developed posthypoxic seizures. Cortisol reached 3 times the NT value at the end of HT. We speculate that the stress of shivering and feeling cold interfered with the previously shown neuroprotective effect of HT. Research on the appropriateness of sedation during clinical HT is urgent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11518829/

The goal was to identify those changes that were sensitive to alterations in the state of consciousness but independent of anaesthetic protocol. Healthy paid volunteers were anaesthetized and reawakened using propofol/remifentanil and sevoflurane/remifentanil, administered in graded steps while the level of arousal was measured. Alterations in the level of arousal were accompanied by significant QEEG changes, many of which were consistent across anaesthetic protocols. Light sedation was accompanied by decreased posterior alpha and increased frontal/central beta power. Frontal power predominance increased with deeper sedation, involving alpha and, to a lesser extent, delta and theta power. With loss of consciousness, delta and theta power increased further in anterior regions and also spread to posterior regions. These changes reversed with return to consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11517126/

E, Statistical, nonlinear, and soft matter physics",2001,"Steyn-Ross DA, Steyn-Ross ML, Wilcocks LC, Sleigh JW","In our two recent papers [M.L. Steyn-Ross et al., Phys. Rev. E 60, 7299 (1999); 64, 011917 (2001)] we presented clinical evidence for a general anesthetic-induced phase change in the cerebral cortex, and showed how the significant features of the cortical phase change (biphasic power surge, spectral energy redistribution, ""heat capacity"" divergence), could be explained using a stochastic single-macrocolumn model of the cortex. The model predictions were based on rather strong ""adiabatic"" assumptions which assert that the mean-field excitatory and inhibitory macrocolumn voltages are ""slow"" variables whose equilibration times are much longer than those of the input ""currents"" that drive the macrocolumn. In the present paper we test the adiabatic assumption by running numerical simulations of the stochastic differential equations. These simulations confirm the number and nature of the steady-state solutions, the growth of fluctuation power at transition, and the redistribution of spectral energy towards lower frequencies. We use spectral entropy to quantify these changes in the power spectral density, and to show that the spectral entropy should decrease markedly at the point of transition. This prediction agrees with recent clinical findings by Viertiö-Oja and colleagues [J. Clinical Monitoring Computing 16, 60 (2000)]. Our modeling work shows that there is an inverse relationship between spectral entropy H and correlation time T of the soma-voltage fluctuations: H inversely proportional to (ln T). In a theoretical analysis we prove that this proportionality becomes exact for an ideal Lorentzian process. These findings suggest that by monitoring the changes in EEG correlation time, it should be possible to track changes in the state of patient consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11461299/

It can be shown that a QPC exists between the frequency ranges 0-2.5 and 3-7.5 Hz and between the frequency ranges 0-2.5 and 8-12 Hz. By means of time-variant bicoherence analysis, a strong phase-locking between the modulating and the modulated component can be identified. The phase-locking is demonstrable within the first 250 ms after the burst onset and comes up to the maximum between 750 and 1250 ms.
The effect is maintained over the whole first part of the burst (2 s) with a decreasing tendency after 1250 ms. All these effects cannot be found in the EEG before entering the burst suppression period (BSP). The transient coupling phenomena in the EEG bursts during BSP can be regarded as indicators for short-term interrelations between the underlying electrophysiologic processes.
It can be suggested that the method introduced for the quantification of the sedation depth should be used.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11459678/

A dramatic decline in the need to use conscious sedation in our EEG laboratory prompted this review of our sedation experience. The purpose of this review was to determine the incidence of adverse sedation effects and to determine why the need for sedation had declined.
All 513 attempts to administer sedation to children who were undergoing EEG studies during a 4-year period were reviewed retrospectively. Parameters studied included type and amount of the sedative agents, need for repeated dosing, successful completion of the EEG, and complications attributed to the sedative.
Sedation was attempted in 513 (18%) of 2855 EEGs performed during the 4-year period. Ninety-one percent of the EEGs performed with sedation were completed successfully. Chloral hydrate was the most frequently administered sedative. Complications (transient oxygen desaturation) occurred in 3 children, all of whom had recognized risk factors for airway compromise. The proportion of children who required sedation decreased from 32% to just 2% during that time period.
Sedation of children who are undergoing EEG examinations is effective and safe. Complications are infrequent. The need for sedation can be decreased greatly by adequate preparation and by creating a less-threatening, child-friendly environment in which to perform the study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11433070/
11432160,The use of bispectral analysis to monitor outpatient sedation.,Anesthesia progress,2000,Sandler NA,"The bispectral (BIS) index has been used to interpret partial EEG recordings to predict the level of sedation and loss of consciousness in patients undergoing general anesthesia. The author has evaluated BIS technology in determining the level of sedation in patients undergoing outpatient deep sedation. These experiences are outlined in this review article. Initially, the correlation of the BIS index with traditional subjective patient evaluation using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) scale was performed in 25 subjects. In a second study, the recovery profile of 39 patients where the BIS was used to monitor sedation was compared with a control group where the monitor was not used. A strong positive relationship between the BIS and OAA/S readings was found in the initial subjects. From the recovery study, it appears that use of the BIS monitor may help titrate the level of sedation so that less drugs are used to maintain the desired level of sedation. A trend to earlier return of motor function in BIS-monitored patients was also demonstrated. BIS technology offers an objective, ordinal means of assessing the depth of sedation. This can be invaluable in comparing studies of techniques. The BIS index provides additional information to standard monitoring techniques that helps guide the administration of sedative-hypnotic agents. The trend to earlier return of motor function in BIS-monitored patients warrants further investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11432160/

Artifact-free data from the 19 electrodes of the International 10/20 System were subjected to quantitative analysis of the electroencephalogram (QEEG). Induction was variously accomplished with etomidate, propofol or thiopental. Anesthesia was maintained throughout the procedures by isoflurane, desflurane or sevoflurane (N = 68), total intravenous anesthesia using propofol (N = 49), or nitrous oxide plus narcotics (N = 59). A set of QEEG measures were found which reversibly displayed high heterogeneity of variance between four states as follows: (1) during induction; (2) just after loss of consciousness (LOC); (3) just before return of consciousness (ROC); (4) just after ROC. Homogeneity of variance across all agents within states was found. Topographic statistical probability images were compared between states. At LOC, power increased in all frequency bands in the power spectrum with the exception of a decrease in gamma activity, and there was a marked anteriorization of power. Additionally, a significant change occurred in hemispheric relationships, with prefrontal and frontal regions of each hemisphere becoming more closely coupled, and anterior and posterior regions on each hemisphere, as well as homologous regions between the two hemispheres, uncoupling. All of these changes reversed upon ROC. Variable resolution electromagnetic tomography (VARETA) was performed to localize salient features of power anteriorization in three dimensions.

Occurrence of sharp transients in the EEG resembling distinctive waves which can be seen in epileptic disorders.
In six of the seven patients under 8.0% sevoflurane, sharp transients were observed which appeared in very deep EEG stages, mostly with endtidal sevoflurane concentrations of 4.8-5.9%. The findings are in accordance with observations in non-epileptic children from our clinic.

About 7 percent of patients undergoing elective caesarean section have reported dreaming or recall of voices during the procedure. The bispectral index (BIS), a value derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG), has been shown to be useful in monitoring the depth of anesthesia. Supplementation of propofol or isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia has been shown to effectively reduce the incidence of awareness. However, the effects of propofol or isoflurane on the BIS index have not been fully investigated. We therefore designed this study to compare the effects of isoflurane or propofol supplementation on the BIS index in 24 healthy parturients undergoing elective caesarean section.
All patients had induction of anesthesia and orotracheal intubation in rapid sequence made possible by 1 MAC isoflurane with 50% N2O-50% O2 as conveyer and atracurium. After delivery, patients were randomly assigned to either of two groups (isoflurane or propofol). Patients in the Isoflurane group (n = 12) received 0.5 MAC isoflurane in 67% N2O-33% O2 and fentanyl + droperidol. Patients in the propofol group (n = 12) received propofol (8 mg/kg/h) infusion combined with 67% N2O-33% O2 and fentanyl + droperidol.
There was no difference between the two groups in total operation time, maternal blood loss, fetal Apgar scores. No differences between the two groups in heart rate, blood pressure or BIS index values were found throughout the surgery. No patient from either group reported recall of the operative procedure. However, 25% of patients (3 of 12) in the isoflurane group had poor uterine contraction, suggestive of doubtful appropriateness of the use of isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia in delivery.
We therefore concluded that supplementation of isoflurane or propofol for maintenance of anesthesia can satisfactorily decrease the BIS index and minimize the incidence of awareness in patients undergoing caesarean section under general anesthesia. The BIS index is a reliable monitor of the hypnotic component of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11407290/

In this study we evaluated the BIS changes in induction of anesthesia with ketamine in comparison with that of thiamylal.
Forty ASA class I and II adult female patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgeries were enrolled into this randomized, prospective study. No premedication was given to the patient. In each patient EEG was recorded continuously from the frontal electrodes using Aspect A-1050 monitor after his arrival at the operating room. Blood pressure and heart rate were also recorded throughout the surgery. After steady baseline recordings of all necessary parameters having been accomplished Group K patients (n = 20) were given an induction dose of ketamine 1.5 mg/kg i.v., whereas Group T patients (n = 20) received thiamylal 5 mg/kg i.v. When loss of consciousness was ascertained, intubation was performed after administration of succinylcholine 1 mg/kg i.v. and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane-nitrous oxide-oxygen. Demographics, BIS values, HR, BP were analyzed and compared.
The demographics were comparable between the two groups. Both groups showed a mean value of BIS of 96 with comparable BP and HR before induction. After study drug the post-induction BIS for ketamine was 94 as against 51 for thiamylal (P < 0.05), 91 against 43 post-succinylcholine (P < 0.05), 92 against 53 post-intubation (P < 0.05) and 45 against 37 five min after isoflurane. BIS remained below 60 throughout the entire course of anesthesia and returned to above 95 on emergence in both groups. None of the patients reported awareness, recall, delirium or hallucination during anesthesia.
Ketamine-induced dissociative anesthesia produces persistently elevated BIS index which is different from thiamylal and those reported with other conventional anesthetic agents. The established range of BIS index appears not to be applicable in patients under ketamine anesthesia.

In a double blind, controlled, randomized and prospective study, 24 ASA I-II patients received either midazolam 0.05 mg x kg(-1) (PM; n = 13) or saline placebo (PO; n = 11) i.v. as premedication. Twenty minutes later, anesthesia was induced by propofol infusion at 30 mg x kg(-1) x hr(-1). ED50, ED95 and group medians for times and doses were determined and compared at multiple anesthetic endpoints.
At the hypnotic, motor and EEG endpoints, midazolam premedication significantly and similarly reduced propofol ED50 (reduction: 18%, 13% and 20% respectively; P <0.05 vs unpremedicated patients) and ED95 (reduction: 20%, 11% and 20% respectively; P <0.05 vs unpremedicated patients). For antinociception (LRP), dose reduction by premedication was greater for propofol ED95 (reduction: 41%; P <0.05 vs unpremedicated patients) than ED50 (reduction: 18%; P <0.05 vs unpremedicated patients). Hemodynamic values were similar in both groups at the various endpoints.
Midazolam premedication 20 min prior to induction of anesthesia reduces the propofol doses necessary to attain the multiple anesthetic endpoints studied without affecting hemodynamics in this otherwise healthy population.

Electroencephalographic monitoring is one method of determining indirectly anesthetic effect on the brain. The present study investigated the effect of surgical stimuli on the concentration-response relation of desflurane-induced electroencephalographic changes.
The electroencephalographic activity was recorded from 24 female patients who received only desflurane after a single induction dose of propofol. Twelve patients served as a control group before surgical stimulation. The other 12 patients, all undergoing lower abdominal surgery, were investigated between opening and closure of the peritoneum. Desflurane vaporizer settings were randomly increased and decreased between 0.5 and 1.6 minimum alveolar concentration as long as anesthesia was considered adequate. Spectral edge frequency 95, median power frequency, and Bispectral Index were calculated. Desflurane effect-site concentrations and the concentration-effect curves for spectral edge frequency 95, median power frequency, and Bispectral Index were determined by simultaneous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling.
Surgical stimulation shifted the desflurane concentration-electroencephalographic effect curves for spectral edge frequency 95, median power frequency, and Bispectral Index toward higher desflurane concentrations. In the unstimulated group, 2.2 +/- 0.74 vol% desflurane were necessary to achieve a Bispectral Index of 50, whereas during surgery, 6.8 +/- 0.98 vol% (mean +/- SE) were required.

Simultaneous scalp and depth EEG recordings have yet to be performed in this setting. The relationship between opiate dose and proconvulsant activity is unclear.
Simultaneous scalp and depth electrode recordings were performed on five patients with complex partial epilepsy (CPE) who underwent alfentanil anesthesia induction before depth electrode removal. Consecutive equal bolus doses of alfentanil were administered to each patient according to strict time intervals so as to assess their correlation with any induced epileptiform activity.
Epileptiform activity was induced by alfentanil in three of five patients. Two of these patients had electrographic seizures. Epileptiform activity was only detected from the depth electrodes, occurring within 2 min of the first bolus dose in all three cases. Further increase or spread of epileptiform activity did not occur despite cumulative bolus doses of alfentanil.
Alfentanil is proconvulsant in patients with CPE. Induced seizures may be subclinical and lack a scalp EEG correlate. There is a complex dose-response relationship. Alfentanil induction of anesthesia should be approached with caution in patients with CPE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11240593/

11166093,Physiological response to ECT stimulus dose.,Psychiatry research,2000,Swartz CM,"For a physiological effect to be useful to regulate the electrical stimulus dose used in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), it must show sensitivity to the stimulus dose. In the analogy of using blood drug concentration to regulate drug dosage, this concentration must be sensitive to the dose. Accordingly, we examined the sensitivity of several physiological effects to ECT stimulus dose. Previously no substantial sensitivity of physiological effects was found when generally effective ECT methods were used. EEG post-ictal suppression, recruitment phase duration, wave form regularity and spike-and-wave frequencies, peak seizure heart rate (HR), and several types of seizure duration were measured with standard and higher dose stimuli given on separate days to 24 subjects. Left frontal to right temporal asymmetric bilateral stimulus placement was applied. Peak HR (P=0.007, t=2.7) and EEG recruitment phase duration (P=0.04, t=1.9) varied with stimulus dose, by 12 beats/min and 1.3 s, respectively. Only peak HR (P=0.02, t=2.2) varied with stimulus dose (by 6 beats/min) when subjects who showed only EEG seizure but no motor seizures were excluded. Subjects who maintained peak HR near their individual maximum values received fewer ECTs than other subjects (P=0.00003, t=5.20); this greater efficacy suggests that the peak HR reflects clinical efficacy as well as stimulus dose. In addition to EEG measurements, peak HR is a candidate to measure ECT seizure quality and provide feedback for stimulus dose regulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11166093/

It can be shown that a transient quadratic phase coupling (QPC) exists between the frequency ranges 0 to 2.5 and 3 to 7.5 Hz and between the frequency ranges 0 to 2.5 and 8 to 12 Hz. The QPC can be explained by an amplitude modulation, where the slow rhythm modulates the rhythmic activities with a higher frequency. By means of time-variant bicoherence analysis, a strong phase-locking between the modulating and the modulated component can be identified. The phase-locking is demonstrable within the first 250 ms after the burst onset and comes up to the maximum between 750 and 1250 ms. The effect is maintained over the whole first part of the burst (2 s) with a decreasing tendency after 1250 ms. All these effects cannot be found in the EEG before entering the burst suppression period (BSP). The transient coupling phenomena in the EEG bursts during BSP can be regarded as indicators for short-term interrelations between the underlying electrophysiologic processes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11165910/

Twenty-three patients participated in the study. Phase synchronization indices based on the Hilbert transform were investigated on frequency bands 0.05-1 Hz, 1-4 Hz, 4-8 Hz, 8-12 Hz and 12-16 Hz for all pairs of the 9 EEG channels covering midline and frontal areas. A straight line was used to approximate the index values as a function of time and the Sign Test statistics were applied to the slope parameters.
Systematic phase synchronization changes were detected. Generally, phase synchronization in the sub-delta band decreased during the induction and increased during the recovery, while the directions were reversed in the alpha band. The changes were dependent on the channel pair. In the delta, theta and beta bands, the changes were aligned more irregularly than in the sub-delta or in the alpha bands. Highly asymmetric behavior between the induction and the recovery periods was also observed in these bands.
Induction and recovery from propofol anesthesia changes the phase synchronization between the EEG channels. The passband and location-specific behavior of these changes reveals the effects of the anesthetic to the different neural mechanisms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11165545/

We retrospectively studied the EEGs of epileptic patients, examined in our laboratory, who, after having undergone an inconclusive initial routine recording, had then been examined with a second recording. This was after either: (1) sleep deprivation with evidence of drowsiness in the recordings, (2) sleep deprivation without drowsiness (indicative of the effect which sleep deprivation per se has in eliciting abnormal patterns), or (3) drug-induced sedation. The activation rates found were (1) 22.5%, (2) 24% (22.6% for sleep deprivation collectively, regardless of the presence or not of subsequent drowsiness) and (3) 27% respectively. Only the sleep deprivation rate was statistically different from the 9.6% increased rate of abnormal patterns elicited by the simple repeating of a second routine recording, while the rate of drug-induced sleep was not.

We developed a new direct brain monitoring system capable of recording intracranial EEGs. This study included 13 patients with head trauma or cerebrovascular accident under deep anesthesia.
The intracranial EEGs showed different patterns of wave activity in depth compared with the cortical surface. In 3 of the cases, the scalp EEG showed a flat tracing at 2.0-2.5% of isoflurane. In two of the cases, the intracranial EEGs showed electrical silence when the scalp EEG was flat. Decreasing the concentration of isoflurane to 1.5%, the intracranial EEG showed single paroxysmal appearance of 'revival' theta waves on the electrocorticogram (ECoG) or electroventriculogram (EVG). The intracranial 'revival' wave was followed by high-voltage burst-waves. In another case, at 2.0-2.5% of isoflurane, the amplitude of the waves was greatest on the EVG.

Nineteen-channel vigilance-controlled EEG recordings were carried out in 20 healthy subjects before and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after drug intake. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA; Key Institute for Brain-Mind Research, software: http://www.keyinst.unizh.ch) was computed from spectrally analyzed EEG data, and differences between drug- and placebo-induced changes were displayed as statistical parametric maps. Data were registered to the Talairach-Tournoux human brain atlas available as a digitized MRI (McConnell Brain Imaging Centre: http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca). At the pharmacodynamic peak (1st hour), buspirone increased theta and decreased fast alpha and beta sources. Areas of theta increase were mainly the left temporo-occipito-parietal and left prefrontal cortices, which is consistent with PET studies on buspirone-induced decreases in regional cerebral blood flow and fenfluramine-induced serotonin activation demonstrated by changes in regional cerebral glucose metabolism. In later hours (8th hour) with lower buspirone plasma levels, delta, theta, slow alpha and fast beta decreased, predominantly in the prefrontal and anterior limbic lobe. Whereas the results of the 1st hour speak for a slight CNS sedation (more in the sense of relaxation), those obtained in the 8th hour indicate activation.

Open, observational trial with retrospective analysis of guideline performance. Data were analyzed from 1,552 adult patients receiving general anesthesia with surgical times of at least 1 hour and who were extubated by postanesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge. Staff were trained using a simple decision matrix, which integrated BIS titration goals with anesthetic management.

Demographic profiles of all groups and subgroups were similar. Anesthetic emergence, recovery times, and volatile drug use were significantly shortened or reduced only when BIS values were maintained between 50 and 65. Extubation time from end of surgery decreased by 2.1 minutes from 5.7+/-7 (37%); OR exit time decreased by 2.2 minutes from 9.3+/-6 (24%); eligibility for phase 1 PACU discharge decreased by 4 minutes from 22+/-42 (23%); and actual PACU discharge decreased by 15 minutes from 130+/-78 (7%).

Five hundred fifty patients underwent revascularization off CPB, with 344 patients having three-vessel disease, 150 two-vessel disease, and 54 one-vessel disease. The use of controlled intermittent hypotension, administering esmolol and nitroglycerine during anesthesia greatly facilitated access to the marginal territory. The reduction of the systemic arterial blood pressure and the heart rate resulted in decrease ventricular wall stress. The heart was pliable, easy to manipulate, herniated into the right pleural cavity, and thus epicardial stabilization was achieved without inducing hemodynamic instability. To avoid the potential detrimental effects of intermittent hypotension we used two continuous brain-monitoring techniques: a) cortical brain oxymetry (cerebro-venous oxygen saturation (CVOS)) and b) electroencephalographic spectral array (EEG). Brain oxymetry changes of more than 20% from baseline value were observed in 15% of patients and preceded the EEG changes observed in 6% of patients. A reduction of CVOS, more than 20% for one to two minutes from baseline values required pharmacological intervention with alpha agents. The combination of both CVOS and EEG required temporary placement of the heart back into the pericardial cavity. Normalization of CVOS and EEG to baseline values was always restored. Following recovery the addition of alpha agents and reduction of drug dosage allowed successful cardiac herniation.
We performed a total of 1,579 grafts on 1,389 VD, obtaining a ratio of 1.13 grafts for VD. In the entire group, there were 411 patients with circumflex disease who underwent 456 bypass grafts (ratio of 1.1). The stroke incidence was not significantly different than patients operated on using CPB.

The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study was to compare the quality and characteristics of sedation with midazolam or propofol in patients undergoing ERCP.
A total of 32 patients undergoing ERCP were randomly allocated for sedation with propofol (n = 15) or midazolam (n = 17). Blood pressure, heart rate, and O2 saturation were monitored. Sedation was maintained at near constant levels by use of the spectral edge frequency (SEF) technique, an EEG-based method for measuring the depth of sedation. Clinical variables, patient cooperation, time to recovery, and amnesia served as outcome variables.
There was no significant difference between the two study groups in patient characteristics. The ""target SEF"" was 13.6 +/- 0.7 Hz for the propofol group and 14.8 +/- 1.1 Hz for the midazolam group (n.s.). The only clinical parameter with a significant difference between the groups was the percent of time in which the heart rate deviated more than 20% from baseline for at least 2 minutes, i.e. 14.6 +/- 2.0 % for propofol and 48.2 +/- 38.0% for midazolam (P<0.01). Patient cooperation was better in the propofol group than in the midazolam group (full cooperation, 13/15 vs. 1/17, respectively; P<0.001). Patient recovery was significantly quicker in the propofol group (P<0.001). The degree of amnesia was similar in both groups; no patient in either group remembered details of the procedure.

Elevation of electroencephalographic (EEG) Beta/Alpha Ratio has been linked to onset of midazolam amnesia. Propofol anaesthesia for cardioversion in 19 patients enabled us to profile the changes in BIS and Beta/Alpha Ratio during a short, single-agent anaesthetic with a relatively rapid induction and recovery period. BIS values did not alter significantly through onset of amnesia and hypnosis as compared with awake values. Cardioversion occurred over a wide range of BIS values (38 to 94), with recovery at a median BIS value of 79. We observed the BIS to lag about 60 s behind the clinical situation (termed BIS60). The BIS60 more closely tracked the clinical level of consciousness, showing statistically significant differences from the uncorrected BIS.

There was no significant EEG response to cardioversion. We conclude that: (1) in rapidly changing conditions, the value of the BIS most accurately reflects the level of consciousness of the patient about 60 s in the past, and (2) the onset and offset of propofol-induced amnesia commonly corresponds to a peak in Beta/Alpha Ratio of the EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10969364/

Preoperatively, the mean seizure frequency was 12.1 per day, or 364 per month (range, 0.06-200 per day, 1.8-6000 per month). Before surgery, 40% of patients were classified with generalized tonic-clonic seizures of different etiologies, or cryptogenic seizures; 36% had mixed seizures; 19% had Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome; and 5% had West Syndrome. Usually, routine EEG, computed tomography, and clinical findings sufficed for the surgical decision. The standard microsurgical technique performed was an anterior two-thirds CCS by the same surgeon under general anesthesia. In five cases, an additional frontal lobe excision after electrocorticography and subdural electrode monitoring was carried out in the same session. The results were evaluated after a mean follow-up of 35 months (range, 12-28). Two thirds of patients became seizure-free or were left with none or some disabling seizures. AED medication was eased slightly after surgery. The complication rate was low. The patients underwent postoperative psychosocial studies and neuropsychological rehabilitation and showed tendencies toward improvement. The direct cost of CCS in U.S. dollars (US$) ranged between 3,137 and 3,995 depending on the preoperative studies. Thus, CCS is well suited for selected patients in developing countries.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) power was measured in three frequency bands to quantify cortical activity, and autonomic heart rate control was quantified using spontaneous baroreflex assessment and power spectral analysis of pulse interval.
Sedation scores closely paralleled propofol blood concentrations (0, 0.53 +/- 0.34, 1.24 +/- 0.21, 3.11 +/- 0.80, and 0.96 +/- 0.42 microg x mL(-1) at baseline, three infusion levels and recovery respectively), and all subjects were unconscious at the deepest level. Indices of autonomic heart rate control were decreased only at the deepest levels of CNS depression, while EEG effects were apparent at all propofol infusion rates. These EEG effects were frequency specific, with power in the beta band being affected at light levels of sedation, and alpha and delta power altered at deeper levels.
The results of this study support a relative preservation of neurovegetative circulatory control mechanisms during the early stages of CNS depression using gradually increasing rates of infusion of propofol. Indices of circulatory control did not reliably reflect depth of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10831201/

Subjects received orally administered placebo and alprazolam in a randomized, double-blind, single-dose crossover study. The elimination half-life, time of maximum plasma concentration, maximum concentration, volume of distribution, and clearance of alprazolam were similar for both groups. For each cohort, alprazolam treatment (vs. placebo) produced significant changes in typical benzodiazepine agonist effects, such as increased sedation and impaired cognitive performance on the digit-symbol substitution test. For the panic disorder group only, there was a significant increase in the subjective rating of""contented"" and a reduction in the rating of ""easily irritated."" For the healthy volunteer group, alprazolam produced increases in ratings of ""fatigued"" and ""slowed thinking,"" but also increases in ratings of ""relaxed."" In each group, alprazolam significantly increased the electroencephalographic (EEG) measure of relative beta amplitude (range, 13-30 Hz) compared with placebo. Concentration-EEG response curves fit a sigmoid E(max) model, and there was greater sensitivity to EEG effects, as measured by a 28% reduction in the EC50 value, in the panic disorder group compared with healthy control subjects. After alprazolam treatment, there was increased sensitivity to EEG and mood effects and fewer aversive effects in the panic disorder group compared with healthy subjects. There were no differences in the pharmacodynamic measures of sedation and cognition or differences in pharmacokinetics between the two groups.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10831021/

Flumazenil is a potent antagonist of midazolam-induced sedation. Physostigmine has also been shown to reverse benzodiazepine sedation in anecdotal reports. The aim of this study was to quantitatively characterize the reversal of midazolam-induced changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) by physostigmine compared to flumazenil and placebo.
Twelve healthy male subjects received 5 mg midazolam as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes after the end of infusion, single doses of either 0.4 mg flumazenil, 0.5 mg physostigmine, or placebo (physiologic saline solution) were administered as intravenous injections in a randomized crossover fashion. Midazolam serum concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The time from the start of injection until awakening was noted and the EEG was measured.
Four subjects were excluded from further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis because no midazolam-induced changes on EEG alpha power could be observed in each of the three study periods. The pharmacokinetics of midazolam were not influenced by flumazenil or physostigmine. Midazolam induced a decrease in EEG alpha power (7.50 to 11.25 Hz) compared with baseline (P < .05). After injection of flumazenil and physostigmine, an increase in EEG alpha power was observed, whereas placebo did not affect alpha power. Subjects opened their eyes 25.2 +/- 1.1 minutes after the placebo injection was begun, whereas subjects awoke after 6.2 +/- 2.7 minutes and 15.4 +/- 3.4 minutes after they received flumazenil and physostigmine, respectively (mean +/- SEM; P < .001).
Physostigmine and flumazenil antagonized midazolam-induced sedation. This suggests that a reversible central anticholinergic mechanism may be involved in the sedative action of midazolam.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10824633/

10776835,Levobupivacaine: a review of its pharmacology and use as a local anaesthetic.,Drugs,2000,"Foster RH, Markham A","Based on findings that the cardiotoxicity infrequently observed with racemic bupivacaine shows enantioselectivity, i.e. it is more pronounced with the R(+)-enantiomer, the S(-)-enantiomer (levobupivacaine) has been developed for clinical use as a long acting local anaesthetic. The majority of in vitro, in vivo and human pharmacodynamic studies of nerve block indicate that levobupivacaine has similar potency to bupivacaine. However, levobupivacaine had a lower risk of cardiovascular and CNS toxicity than bupivacaine in animal studies. In human volunteers, levobupivacaine had less of a negative inotropic effect and, at intravenous doses >75 mg, produced less prolongation of the QTc interval than bupivacaine. Fewer changes indicative of CNS depression on EEG were evident with levobupivacaine. Levobupivacaine is long acting with a dose-dependent duration of anaesthesia. The onset of action is < or = 15 minutes with various anaesthetic techniques. In studies of surgical anaesthesia in adults, levobupivacaine provided sensory block for up to 9 hours after epidural administration of < or = 202.5 mg, 6.5 hours after intrathecal 15 mg, and 17 hours after brachial plexus block with 2 mg/kg. Randomised, double-blind clinical studies established that the anaesthetic and/or analgesic effects of levobupivacaine were largely similar to those of bupivacaine at the same dose. Sensory block tended to be longer with levobupivacaine than bupivacaine, amounting to a difference of 23 to 45 minutes with epidural administration and approximately 2 hours with peripheral nerve block. With epidural administration, levobupivacaine produced less prolonged motor block than sensory block. This differential was not seen with peripheral nerve block. Conditions satisfactory for surgery and good pain management were achieved by use of local infiltration or peribulbar administration of levobupivacaine. Levobupivacaine was generally as effective as bupivacaine for pain management during labour, and was effective for the management of postoperative pain, especially when combined with clonidine, morphine or fentanyl. The tolerability profiles of levobupivacaine and bupivacaine were very similar in clinical trials. No clinically significant ECG abnormalities or serious CNS events occurred with the doses used. The most common adverse event associated with levobupivacaine treatment was hypotension (31%).
Levobupivacaine is a long acting local anaesthetic with a clinical profile closely resembling that of bupivacaine. However, current preclinical safety and toxicity data show an advantage for levobupivacaine over bupivacaine. Clinical data comparing levobupivacaine with ropivacaine are needed before the role of the drug can be fully established. Excluding pharmacoeconomic considerations, levobupivacaine is an appropriate choice for use in place of bupivacaine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10776835/

It was the purpose of this project to assess the usefulness of BIS technology in determining the level of sedation in patients undergoing third molar extraction under conscious sedation.
Twenty-five subjects undergoing third molar extraction in an outpatient setting were analyzed. The EEG activity was recorded continually during surgery using a microcomputer (Aspect-1050 Monitor; Aspect Co, Natick, MA) with real-time bispectral data obtained by EEG skin electrodes through a frontotemporal montage. The Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) scale was used to subjectively assess the level of sedation observed by the anesthetist before initiating the sedation procedure and then at 5-minute intervals until the end of the procedure. The BIS level was simultaneously recorded. The initial sedation was accomplished using a standard dose of midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) and fentanyl (1.5 microg/kg) followed by a 10- to 30-mg bolus of propofol until a level of sedation at which the patient's eyes were closed and he or she was responsive only to vigorous stimulation or repeated loud calling of their name (OAA/S level of 1 to 2). Local anesthesia was then administered. Additional doses of sedative medication (midazolam or propofol) were given during the procedure to maintain the desired level of sedation (an OAA/S level of 2 to 3). The time and dose of the drug given were recorded. The level of sedation based on a single anesthetist's interpretation (OAA/S) and the BIS readings were then compared.
A strong positive relationship between the BIS index and OAA/S readings was found (P < .0001). Pairwise comparisons of mean BIS index and its corresponding OAA/S level were significantly different from each other (P < .003) except for OAA/S levels 2 and 3 (P = .367).
BIS technology offers an objective, ordinal means of assessing the depth of sedation. There was a strong relationship between the objective BIS values and subjective assessment (OAA/S scale) of the depth of anesthesia. This can be invaluable in providing an objective assessment of sedation in oral and maxillofacial surgery where it may be difficult to determine the level of sedation clinically.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10759114/

""Approximate entropy"" is a new statistical parameter derived from the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy formula which quantifies the amount of regularity in data. The approximate entropy quantifies the predictability of subsequent amplitude values of the EEG based on the knowledge of the previous amplitude values. The authors investigated the dose-response relation of the EEG approximate entropy during desflurane anesthesia in comparison with spectral edge frequency 95, median frequency, and bispectral index.
Twelve female patients were studied during gynecologic laparotomies. Between opening and closure of the peritoneum, end-tidal desflurane concentrations were varied between 0.5 and 1.6 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). The EEG approximate entropy, median EEG frequency, spectral edge frequency 95, and bispectral index were determined and the performance of each to predict the desflurane effect compartment concentration, obtained by simultaneous pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, was compared.
Electroencephalogram approximate entropy decreased continuously over the observed concentration range of desflurane. The performance of the approximate entropy (prediction probability PK = 0.86 +/- 0.06) as an indicator for desflurane concentrations is similar to spectral edge frequency 95 (PK = 0.86 +/- 0.06) and bispectral index (PK = 0.82 +/- 0.06) and is statistically significantly better than median frequency (PK = 0.78 +/- 0.06).

EEGs of 104 patients under general anesthesia were processed by three different methods: a) ""on-line"" visual analysis during surgery, b) ""off-line"" visual analysis in laboratory, and c) computer analysis. To identify pathological EEGs, variability and asymmetry indexes of the 0.5-3.5 Hz and 8-15 Hz bands, absolute power and variability indexes of spectral edge frequency (SEF), and main dominant frequency were evaluated. On-line visual analysis showed clamp-related modifications in 29 EEGs (27.9%). Off-line visual analysis detected 24 pathological EEGs (23.1%): 18 with major changes and 6 with moderate changes. Computer analysis showed 21 EEGs (20.19%) with at least one altered index and 7 (6.7%) with altered variability for both SEF and 8-15 Hz power. The statistical analysis was significant for SEF variability and for 8-15 Hz power variability and asymmetry (P < 0.0001, analysis of variance test). While SEF and 8-15 Hz power variability did not appear influenced by anesthesia and single electrode artifacts, 8-15 Hz power asymmetry index was confounded by the presence of contralateral internal carotid occlusion. The data show that the use of these spectral indexes adds objective information to visual analysis, supporting and making easier intraoperative strategies.

It is often assumed that the cerebral metabolic and protective effects of qualitative burst suppression are similar to those of the isoelectric encephalogram (EEG). We have examined the effect of different degrees of EEG suppression on blood flow and oxygen difference during general anaesthesia. We studied 11 patients undergoing general anaesthesia for resection of acoustic neuromas. The study was performed after surgery with propofol and remifentanil anaesthesia. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and jugular bulb venous saturations were measured at values of EEG suppression: 0%, 50% and 100% (isoelectric EEG). Data from nine patients were suitable for analysis. There were no significant differences in mean arterial pressure, heart rate or PaCO2 during EEG activity, 50% burst suppression ratio or isoelectric EEG. There was a significant decrease in middle cerebral artery flow velocity (vmca) with increasing EEG suppression (0% suppression, mean 38 (SEM 4) cm s-1; 50% suppression, 29 (3) cm s-1; and 100% suppression, 24 (2) cm s-1; P < 0.05). Jugular bulb venous saturations did not change consistently with the change in EEG activity, indicating intact flow-metabolism coupling. We conclude that the degree of EEG suppression had a significant effect on blood flow. If flow-metabolism coupling is maintained, the assumption that cerebral metabolism during 50% EEG burst suppression is equivalent to isoelectric EEG may not be justified. If cerebral protection is related to brain metabolism, then an isoelectric EEG may give more cerebral protection than 50% burst suppression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10673873/

In a longitudinal study of prenatal cocaine/crack exposure, women were interviewed at the end of each trimester about cocaine, crack, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use. Two-hour paper- and computer-generated EEG sleep recordings were obtained on a sample of the full-term infants on the second day of life and at 1 year postpartum. Eligible newborns were full-term, had received no general anesthesia, and had a 5-minute Apgar score >5. All infants whose mothers used one or more lines of cocaine during their first trimester or any crack (n = 37) were selected. A comparison group was chosen randomly from the group of women who did not use cocaine or crack during their pregnancy (n = 34).
Women who used cocaine/crack during the first trimester were older, less educated, less likely to be working, and used more tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs than women who did not use cocaine/crack during the first trimester. There were no differences in infant birth weight, length, head circumference, or gestational age between the two exposure groups. After controlling for the significant covariates, prenatal cocaine exposure was associated with less well developed spectral correlations between homologous brain regions at birth, and with lower spectral EEG power values at 1 year of age.

Acoustically evoked short (SLP) and middle (MLP) latency potentials, transitory evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), and EEG power spectra were analysed after short i. v. injections of placebo, or 0.15 mg kg-1 midazolam, or alpha-hydroxy-midazolam, respectively.
All subjects fell asleep during the 4 min infusion of active drug. SLP showed a significant transient increase of Jewett wave V 10 min after injection for midazolam and alpha-hydroxy-midazolam while the latency of wave I was unchanged. Both benzodiazepines induced a marked and long-lasting MLP amplitude decrease for 240 min with slow recovery over the following 360 min. No changes of TEOAE were observed. In agreement with earlier reports, increases in EEG beta activity and decreases in alpha activity were observed after administration of either drug.
Systemically administered benzodiazepines modulate the auditory pathway above the level of the cochlea.

Epileptiform EEG activity (spikes or polyspikes) was seen in all patients with controlled hyperventilation, and in seven patients with spontaneous breathing (P < 0.01). Jerking movements were seen in three patients with controlled hyperventilation. In the controlled hyperventilation group, heart rate increased 54% from baseline at 4 min after induction (P < 0.001). Mean arterial pressure increased 17% (P < 0.05), peaking at 3 min. In the spontaneous breathing group, heart rate showed no change, and mean arterial pressure decreased by 14% (P < 0.01) at 6 min. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure differed significantly between the groups from 2 min after beginning of the induction to the end of the trial. An increase in heart rate of more than 30% from baseline always was associated with epileptiform EEG activity.
Sevoflurane mask induction elicits epileptiform EEG patterns. These are associated with an increase in heart rate in patients with controlled hyperventilation and also during spontaneous breathing of sevoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10598599/

We therefore used the median frequency of the EEG power spectrum as a quantitative measure for closed-loop administration of propofol in 21 artificially ventilated patients (nine trauma, 12 non-trauma). The EEG setpoint was correlated with a clinical sedation score and defined such, that mechanical ventilation was tolerated. The sedative therapy was given for 31 +/- 30 h. Non-trauma patients required sedation with an EEG median frequency between 2 and 3 Hz (propofol consumption: 1.4 +/- 0.8 mg kg-1 h-1) and sedation seemed to follow some circadian patterns, whereas trauma patients needed significantly deeper sedation (EEG median frequency: 1-2 Hz; propofol consumption: 2.6 +/- 0.8 mg kg-1 h-1). We conclude that the EEG closed-loop system could safely and reliably administer propofol to maintain a predetermined level of sedation for patients in intensive care unit over a protracted time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10583350/

It has been observed in deep stages of general anesthesia and in conjunction with sedative overdoses. It is also known to occur in the wake of cardiorespiratory arrest. Undercutting of the cortex has been found to result in BS activity. Rare neonatal epileptic encephalopathies also give rise to BS. Our personal interest was prompted by the consistent finding of BS activity in rats following cerebral anoxia (nitrogen inhalation, airway obstruction): after periods of EEG flatness, BS activity developed, followed by periodic bursts and diffuse slowing. On the other hand, earlier literature (before 1960) showed virtually no observation of BS, neither in anoxic patients, nor in animal experiments. It is likely that the introduction of modern intensive care treatment has engineered episodes of BS activity, probably due to modifications of the anoxic cerebral pathology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10578472/

Among patients with refractory epilepsy, this study compared 1) electroencephalographic (EEG) interictal spike activity during wakefulness and sevoflurane anesthesia, and 2) electrocorticographically (ECoG) recorded interictal spike activity during sevoflurane and isoflurane anesthesia. We studied 12 patients undergoing insertion of subdural electrodes. Before commencing anesthesia, awake (baseline) EEG recordings were obtained. After inhaled induction, EEG interictal spike activity was evaluated during stable, normocapnic, and hypocapnic (Paco2 = 28-30 mm Hg), sevoflurane anesthesia administered at 1.5 times the minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (1.5 MAC). Immediately after surgery, ECoG recordings were obtained from subdural electrodes during 1) 1.5 MAC isoflurane, 2) 0.3 MAC isoflurane, and 3) 1.5 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia. EEG spike frequency increased in all patients during sevoflurane anesthesia compared with awake recordings (P = 0.002). Compared with 0.3 MAC isoflurane anesthesia, ECoG interictal spike frequency was higher in all patients during 1.5 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia (P = 0.004) and in 8 of 10 patients during 1.5 MAC isoflurane anesthesia (P = 0.016). Under sufficiently rigorous conditions, both sevoflurane and isoflurane can provoke interictal spike activity at near burst-suppression doses. This property is more prominent with sevoflurane than isoflurane.
The results of this study suggest that the capacity to modulate neuroexcitability is a dose-dependent feature of volatile anesthetics that is manifested most prominently at near burst-suppression doses (i.e., 1.5 times the minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration) and is minimal or absent at low doses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10553850/

After induction of anaesthesia with propofol and 20 min of positive pressure ventilation via a laryngeal mask airway with 0.6 MAC of isoflurane and 50% nitrous-oxide in oxygen, patients received saline (control), or alfentanil 15 or 50 micrograms kg-1 before intubation. The early cortical AER before and after intubation in each group was measured and compared. After intubation, Pa amplitude increased in the saline group by 60% (95% CI +10 to +130), decreased in the low-dose alfentanil group by 11% (-38 to +29) and decreased further in the high-dose alfentanil group by 26% (-49 to +7). There were significant (P < 0.005) linear trends in the three group means for Pa amplitude. Similarly, Nb latency increased in the saline group by 30% (-2 to +73), decreased in the low-dose alfentanil group by 10% (-32 to +19) and decreased further in the high-dose alfentanil group by 19% (-39 to +7). There were significant (P = 0.02) linear trends in the three group means for Nb amplitude. Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures increased after intubation in the control group, and to a lesser extent in the low-dose alfentanil group, but decreased after high-dose alfentanil. Heart rate increased after intubation in the control group but decreased in both alfentanil groups, decreasing to a greater degree in the high-dose group. There were significant (P < 0.001) linear trends for all three haemodynamic variables in the three groups. We conclude that the increase in Pa amplitude after intubation was blocked by bolus administration of alfentanil and that this effect was dose dependent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10562791/

Following Ethics Committee approval, patients were randomly assigned to one of the following four treatments: Group P (n = 17): propofol infusion, 1 mg kg-1 min-1 intravenous for 2 min, followed by propofol infusion, 200 micrograms kg-1 min-1, until skin incision; Group PF1 (n = 17): fentanyl bolus, 1 microgram kg-1 intravenous + propofol infusion as in Group P; Group PF2 (n = 17): fentanyl bolus, 2 micrograms kg-1 intravenous + propofol infusion as in Group P; and Group PF3 (n = 17): fentanyl bolus, 3 micrograms kg-1 intravenous + propofol infusion as in Group P. The bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency were monitored continuously and recorded prior to induction of anaesthesia (base-line) and at skin incision. Twelve, 10, 4 and 4 patients responded to skin incision in Groups P, PF1, PF2 and PF3, respectively (P and PF1 vs. PF2 or PF3; P = 0.0001, and 0.006). The bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency were significantly lower at skin incision compared with the base-line values in all the four treatment groups. However, only bispectral index values were significantly lower in the nonmovement as compared with the movement (M) category (32.6 +/- 8.9 vs. 37.4 +/- 10.3; P = 0.04). Though deeper levels of hypnosis to lower bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency values may be effective in preventing the movement response to skin incision, provision of adequate analgesia rather than lower bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency (clinical maintenance) values may be more reliable for preventing the response to skin incision as bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency measure the hypnotic component of the anaesthetic effect. Lower bispectral index values may be more discriminatory as compared with 95% spectral edge frequency values for preventing the movement response to skin-incision.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10549460/

Mean values for AEPIndex during consciousness and unconsciousness were 74.5 (SD 14.7) 36.7 (7.1), respectively. BIS had mean values of 89.5 (SD 4.6) during consciousness and 48.8 (16.4) during unconsciousness. AEPIndex and BIS were greater during consciousness compared with during unconsciousness. The average awake values of AEPIndex were significantly higher than all average values during unconsciousness but this was not the case for BIS.

We evaluated whether the bispectral index, median frequency, or 95% spectral edge of the electroencephalogram are sensitive to the sympathetic response seen during reversal of opioid dependence. Eight patients undergoing rapid opioid detoxification gave informed consent. Two-channel frontal electroencephalogram was measured. Sympathetic heart rate variability was measured in 256 second segments by Fourier transform of continuous heart rate and the low frequency segment (0.02-0.13 Hz) analyzed for sympathetic function. Patients were anesthetized with propofol infusion. After a 30-60 min steady state, naloxone was infused intravenously at a rate of 25 mg/30 min, followed by an infusion of 1 mg/hr. During induction of anesthesia, sympathetic heart rate variability decreased from 1.80 to 0.3, bispectral index from 86 to 47, median frequency from 10.2 to 3.4, spectral edge from 23.5 to 16.7 (all P<.05). During naloxone infusion, the median percent increase in sympathetic heart rate variability was 487% (P<.05), median frequency increased 163% (P<.05), bispectral index (10%), and spectral edge (7%) did not significantly change. The increase in median frequency was delayed compared to sympathetic heart rate variability and median frequency remained elevated after sympathetic heart rate variability returned to anesthetized baseline in 5 of 8 cases. Our results show that median frequency and sympathetic heart rate variability increase during opioid detoxification, but the time course of each response is different. Median frequency is a more sensitive electroencephalogram indicator of opioid reversal than bispectral index or spectral edge.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10527144/

The approach is based upon an extension of the backpropagation algorithm for the correction of the preprocessing parameters. In comparison with purely neural systems, the reduced input dimensionality improves the generalization capability and reduces the numerical effort. In comparison with PPUs with fixed parameters, the success of the adaptation is less sensitive to the choice of the parameters. The efficiency of the developed method is demonstrated via the use of quadratic filters with adaptable transmission bands as preprocessing units for the segmentation of two different types of discontinuous EEG: discontinuous neonatal EEG (burst-interburst segmentation) and EEG in deep stages of sedation (burst-suppression segmentation).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10522126/

It has higher affinity for limbic compared to striatal dopamine receptors in vivo. At low doses, amisulpride facilitates dopamine transmission via a selective blockade of presynaptic D2- and D3-receptors. Amisulpride is an active antipsychotic compound effective at low doses for negative symptoms and at high doses for positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The CNS profile of multiple doses of a low dosage regimen of amisulpride (50 mg once daily for 4 days) was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, 3-way crossover, placebo-controlled study carried out in 12 young sleep-deprived (for 36 h) subjects, using EEG and various measures of psychomotor and cognitive functions. Caffeine slow release (600 mg) was used as a positive reference. Multiple doses of 50 mg amisulpride once daily were devoid of any detrimental effects on EEG and psychomotor performance and cognitive function after total sleep deprivation. In addition, 50mg amisulpride partially antagonized the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation on EEG and subjective sedation as shown by trends, and a significant increase in EEG relative beta power and a decrease in subjective sedation. These effects were more pronounced at the end of sleep deprivation, suggesting possible alerting effects of amisulpride at this dose level. Caffeine significantly antagonized the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation on vigilance (increase in EEG beta waves, speed of reaction, sustained attention and reduction in subjective sedation). In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that 50 mg amisulpride is devoid of detrimental effects on EEG, psychomotor and cognitive performance after sleep deprivation, a situation well-known to amplify such effects if they exist. Moreover, some data suggest possible alerting effects of this low dosage regimen of amisulpride.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10520732/
10510142,Electroencephalographic and psychomotor effects of chlorpromazine and risperidone relative to placebo in normal healthy volunteers.,British journal of clinical pharmacology,1999,"Hughes AM, Lynch P, Rhodes J, Ervine CM, Yates RA","To investigate the effects of single oral doses of chlorpromazine (50 mg) and risperidone (2 mg) relative to placebo on topographical electroencephalometry (CATEEMTM ) and psychomotor tests in 12 healthy male volunteers.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design using a double dummy blinding technique was utilized. Chlorpromazine was selected as representative of the 'typical' neuroleptics, being also highly sedative. Risperidone has been suggested as representative of the newer 'atypical' neuroleptics and is claimed to be only minimally sedative. Volunteers were dosed on 3 separate days with a minimum of 7 days interval between trial days. On each trial day volunteers were dosed twice. Dose 1 consisting of either chlorpromazine 50 mg or placebo to chlorpromazine, and dose 2 either risperidone 2 mg or placebo to risperidone. The volunteers were randomized so that each received either chlorpromazine or risperidone (or neither), but not both on an individual trial day. A 17 electrode quantitative topographical electroencephalograph (EEG) recording was taken for each volunteer before and after each dosing period. Seven psychomotor function tests were used to determine the effects of each treatment on psychomotor performance.
The data confirm the cited reports of sedation following single oral doses of chlorpromazine 50 mg. However, 7 of the 12 volunteers dosed with risperidone 2 mg also reported drowsiness/lethargy which was of greater severity and duration than 5 of the 12 volunteers who reported somnolence following dosing with chlorpromazine 50 mg. Objective assessment of psychomotor impairment using a short battery of psychomotor function tests mirrored the subjective reports of somnolence in that the impairment in volunteers dosed with risperidone 2 mg was greater in extent and magnitude than in volunteers dosed with chlorpromazine 50 mg. With respect to the cortical quantitative electroencephalogram, both chlorpromazine (50 mg) and risperidone (2 mg) increased power (4.75-6.75 Hz) in keeping with cited effects of other neuroleptics on the quantitative EEG. In addition, there was a statistically significant increase (P<0.05) in alpha1 (7.0-9.5 Hz) and beta1 (12.75-18.5 Hz) wavebands in volunteers dosed with risperidone 2 mg. Furthermore, based on estimates of variability, we propose that a 3 min eyes open and 3 min eyes closed quantitative EEG recording is sufficient to maintain adequate power for this technique, whilst allowing its application to early volunteer trials of novel neuroleptic agents.
This study demonstrates that quantitative EEG can be utilized in the profiling of neuroleptic agents, and could be readily applied to the early profiling of novel neuroleptics in limited numbers of volunteers, early in drug development. The chosen battery of psychomotor tests has clearly demonstrable sensitivity to the quantification of the subjective reports of somnolence secondary to both chlorpromazine and risperidone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10510142/

A small risk of sedation may exist and may not have been discovered by those studies due to their small sample size.
Using combined data, there is no increased risk of sedation over placebo for patients using 10 mg of loratadine daily.
Literature search and meta-analysis of published data was performed.
Pooled data showed sedation in 25 of 517 patients given 10 mg of loratadine, and 24 of 510 patients given placebo. The relative risk was 1.03, with a confidence interval from 0.59 to 1.77. Sleepiness was objectively studied using the multiple sleep latency test. Patients treated with 10 mg of loratadine did not have excess sleepiness induced; patients treated with 40 mg of loratadine did. Using 10 different methods, 20 studies did not find performance impairment in subjects given 10 mg of loratadine. Two performance studies, digit substitution and driving, showed impairment with 20 mg and 40 mg of loratadine, respectively. Physiologic studies using resting EEG had conflicting reports. There was no impairment detected in altitude studies or vestibular studies. No centrifuge or color vision data were found.
Ingesting 10 mg of loratadine daily does not have sedative effects or impair cognitive-motor performance. Higher doses have demonstrated impairment. Aviation concerns that have not been addressed include centrifuge studies and color vision studies. It would be reasonable to employ loratadine in the high performance aerospace environment if these latter tests prove to be negative.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10503759/

First-generation antihistamines readily cross the blood-brain barrier leading to significant drowsiness, altered mood, reduced wakefulness, and impaired cognitive and psychomotor performance. This paper reviews of studies CNS functioning conducted with loratadine, a second-generation H1-receptor antagonist, at its therapeutic dose of 10 mg per day. Studies employing self-report measures, such as diary cards, visual analogue scales, rating scales, and mood inventories have shown that the effect of loratadine on somnolence, fatigue, and mood was comparable to those found with placebo. In studies exploring physiological indices of CNS functioning, such as EEG-evoked potentials, and sleep latency tests, loratadine has been shown to be free of CNS effects. In addition, studies have investigated the effects of loratadine on actual driving performance, and on tests of cognitive and psychomotor functioning. On all of these performance measures, loratadine has been shown to have effects comparable to placebo. In contrast, diphenhydramine, a common first-generation antihistamine, usually available without a doctor's prescription, has significant adverse effects on vigilance, divided attention, working memory and psychomotor performance.

Either fentanyl (7 micrograms/kg; n = 30) or sufentanil (1 microgram/kg; n = 30) were given in a randomized fashion to induce anesthesia in heavily premedicated patients, followed by pancuronium bromide (100 micrograms/kg). EEG-power spectra (delta, theta, alpha, beta) as well as mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HF) were measured at the following end-points: before the induction of anesthesia (control), 1 and 10 minutes after laryngoscopy and intubation (L & I). Linear regression analysis was computed to determine which of the EEG power spectra was most sensitive to detect insufficient blockade of nociceptive-related arousal when correlated with haemodynamics. In the fentanyl group the change in HF closely correlated with the decrease of power in the slow delta- and theta-domain (r2 = 0.98 and r2 = 0.89 respectively) of the EEG. The change in MAP also closely correlated with a decrease in the slow delta- and theta-domain (r2 = 0.97 and r2 = 0.99 respectively). There was little correlation in regard to spectral edge frequency (SEF) and HF and MAP changes (r2 = 0.36 and r2 = 0.12 respectively). In the sufentanil group the change in HF correlated closely with an increase of power in the fast alpha and a decrease in the slow theta-domain (r2 = 0.91 and r2 = 0.98 respectively) of the EEG. The changes in MAP closely correlated with an increase in the fast alpha-band a decrease in the slow theta-domain (r2 = 0.98 and r2 = 0.73 respectively). Also there was little correlation of SEF with HF and MAP changes (r2 = 0.09 and r2 = 0.02 respectively). Among the EEG-spectra, reduction of power in the slow delta- and theta-bands are the most sensitive parameters to determine insufficient antinociception of opioids commonly used for the induction in cardiac anesthesia. Increase of power in the alpha-band seems to be closely correlated with cortical reactivation and reduction of hypnosis, while a reduction of power especially in the deltabut more so in the theta-band of the EEG reflects nociception related arousal.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10418645/

EEG analysis accompanied by clinical assessment, CT and MRI scans, and cerebral angiography were performed.
With pentobarbital coma, the EEG showed burst suppression with prominent interhemispheric asynchrony. Suppression epochs >2 s in duration and with amplitude <20 microV in all channels were identified. In 12 min of the EEG analyzed, 6 unilateral and 20 bilateral epochs occurred. Of the 20 bilateral suppression epochs, interhemispheric asynchrony of >1 s was noted at onset for 5 epochs and at offset for one. Chi-square analysis revealed an equal tendency for unilateral suppressions to occur over either hemisphere, and for suppression in one hemisphere to begin before the other.
We conclude that the corpus callosum plays a critical role in interhemispheric synchronization of cortical neuronal electrical activity and propose that: (1) normally, the corpus callosum modulates interhemispheric synchronization of cortical inhibition; and (2) with corpus callosal disruption, cortical areas are 'released' from such synchronization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10402090/

Nine younger (24 to 28 years) and nine elderly (67 to 81 years) male volunteers received midazolam by a computer-controlled device. Two infusion cycles with linearly increasing target plasma levels (slope, 40 ng/mL/min for the younger subjects; 20 ng/mL/min for the elderly subjects) were administered until defined end points were attained (median EEG frequency <4 Hz and loss of responsiveness to acoustic stimuli). An EEG was recorded to quantitate the hypnotic effect, relating the median frequency of the power spectrum to the plasma level by a sigmoid Emax model, including an effect compartment. Pharmacokinetic data were derived from arterial blood samples with use of a three-compartment model.
The total doses needed to reach the defined end points were 71+/-9 mg and 35+/-6 mg for the younger and elderly subjects, respectively (P < .001). Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar in both groups (clearance, 399+/-91 and 388+/-97 mL/min; steady-state volume of distribution, 85+/-22 and 104 +/-11 L in young and elderly subjects, respectively). Pharmacodynamic data showed a large difference in half-maximum concentration (EC50; young subjects, 522+/-236 ng/mL; elderly subjects, 223+/-56 ng/mL; P < .05), a steep concentration-response curve, and distinct hysteresis. We found much interindividual variability in the plasma concentrations necessary to achieve the clinical end points, regardless of age.
These results suggest that the lower doses needed to reach sedation in the elderly subjects were attributable to a 50% decrease in EC50, not to changes in pharmacokinetics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10391668/

We sought to determine whether the depth of EEG suppression correlated with persistent seizure control in such patients.
We reviewed the EEGs and clinical course of patients treated with pentobarbital (PTB) for RSE. Persistent seizure control or relapse to status epilepticus after the taper of PTB was determined with reference to the depth of EEG suppression during treatment.
Of 35 patients tapering PTB, persistent seizure control was achieved in six of 12 patients reaching a burst-suppression record at greatest depth of EEG suppression and in 17 of 20 patients reaching a ""flat"" record; three patients with neither pattern had persistent control. Survival also was somewhat better in the more suppressed group. Isolated epileptiform discharges during the barbiturate infusion did not correlate with outcome. Recurrence of electrographic status after PTB taper predicted clinical relapse.
The EEG is important in managing PTB treatment for patients with RSE. Some period of intense seizure and EEG suppression may help in preventing relapse of status after the PTB taper. It is not necessary to suppress all epileptiform discharges, but persistent clinical and EEG monitoring is necessary to avoid relapses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10368075/
10358784,QEEG changes during cardiopulmonary bypass: relationship to postoperative neuropsychological function.,Clinical EEG (electroencephalography),1999,"Gugino LD, Chabot RJ, Aglio LS, Aranki S, Dekkers R, Maddi R","The relationship of changes in intraoperative QEEG and postoperative cognitive function was studied in 32 patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). All patients were anesthetized with a high dose narcotic technique in which CPB was carried out using moderate hypothermia. EEG recorded continuously throughout each procedure was analyzed using the neurometric technique. Neuropsychological (NP) evaluations were administered to all patients before, 1 week and 2-3 months postoperatively. A decrement in postoperative performance of 2 standard deviations in two or more tests from preoperative testing was defined as a new cognitive deficit. Of the patients studied, 40.6% demonstrated a new postoperative cognitive deficit at 1 week. At 2-3 months postoperatively, 28.1% continued to show a cognitive deficit. Discriminant analysis of the QEEG as a function of NP performance was calculated at select times during the surgical procedure. QEEG prediction of NP performance was just above chance at the 1 week comparison but excellent for the 2-3 month comparisons. This study suggests that with appropriate monitoring protocols, intraoperative QEEG may predict cognitive dysfunction experienced by patients 2-3 months postoperatively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10358784/
10357354,Middle latency auditory evoked responses and electroencephalographic derived variables do not predict movement to noxious stimulation during 1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration isoflurane/nitrous oxide anesthesia.,Anesthesia and analgesia,1999,"Kochs E, Kalkman CJ, Thornton C, Newton D, Bischoff P, Kuppe H, Abke J, Konecny E, Nahm W, Stockmanns G","The electroencephalogram (EEG) and middle latency auditory evoked responses (MLAER) have been proposed for assessment of the depth of anesthesia. However, a reliable monitor of the adequacy of anesthesia has not yet been defined. In a multicenter study, we tested whether changes in the EEG and MLAER after a tetanic stimulus applied to the wrist could be used to predict subsequent movement in response to skin incision in patients anesthetized with 1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) isoflurane in N2O. We also investigated whether the absolute values of any of these variables before skin incision was able to predict subsequent movement. After the induction of anesthesia with propofol and facilitation of tracheal intubation with succinylcholine, 82 patients received 1 MAC isoflurane (0.6%) in N2O 50% without an opioid or muscle relaxant. Spontaneous EEG and MLAER to auditory click-stimulation were recorded from a single frontoparietal electrode pair. MLAER were severely depressed at 1 MAC isoflurane. At least 20 min before skin incision, a 5-s tetanic stimulus was applied at the wrist, and the changes in EEG and MLAER were recorded. EEG and MLAER values were evaluated before and after skin incision for patients who did not move in response to tetanic stimulation. Twenty patients (24%) moved after tetanic stimulation. The changes in the EEG or MLAER variables were unable to predict which patients would move in response to skin incision. Preincision values were not different between patients who did and did not move in response to skin incision for any of the variables. MLAER amplitude increased after skin incision. We conclude that it is unlikely that linear EEG measures or MLAER variables can be of practical use in titrating isoflurane anesthesia to prevent movement in response to noxious stimulation.
Reliable estimation of anesthetic adequacy remains a challenge. Changes in spontaneous or auditory evoked brain activity after a brief electrical stimulus at the wrist could not be used to predict whether anesthetized patients would subsequently move at the time of surgical incision.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10357354/
10350112,"Clamping ischemia, threshold ischemia and delayed insertion of the shunt during carotid endarterectomy with patch.",The Journal of cardiovascular surgery,1999,"Deriu GP, Milite D, Mellone G, Cognolato D, Frigatti P, Grego F","Shunt insertion during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is mandatory to avoid neurological damage due to clamping ischemia; however shunt insertion before plaque removal has many inconveniences (atheroembolism, intimal dissection, difficulty of endarterectomy). The aim of this study is to verify whether and how long shunt insertion may be safely delayed to permit plaque removal and ensure cerebral perfusion during the further time consuming manoeuvres of CEA (peeling, patch angioplasty).
From July 1990 to February 1996 383 patients underwent 411 CEAs under general anesthesia with EEG continuous monitoring and PTFE patch angioplasty. A Pruitt-Inahara shunt was routinely inserted only after atherosclerotic plaque removal. In 316 CEAs (76.9%) without EEG signs of cerebral ischemia (Group A) the mean clamping time was 10 min +/-4.8 (range 2-37 min). In 95 CEAs (23.1%) with EEG signs of cerebral ischemia (Group B) it was 7.3 min +/-3.5 (range 3-20 min). All patients had normal EEG signals after delayed shunt insertion and reperfusion (mean 21 min, range 5-45 min).
In the short term results (within 30 days) there was a relevant neurological complication rate of 0.96% (2 major stroke and 2 lethal stroke); at awakening we observed 5 RINDs (1.21% of total) 1 in a patient of Group A (0.31%) and the other 4 in patients of Group B (4.21%).
These data confirm the rationale of a delayed insertion of the shunt: actually the cerebral parenchyma may tolerate under general anesthesia a sufferance due to carotid clamping, EEG detectable, without neurological deficits for at least 7.3 min. This time is sufficient to perform the most difficult steps of CEA (plaque removal, distal intima checking) allowing shunt insertion in a clean operatory field, without inconveniences. Finally the shunt allows complementary time consuming steps, as patch angioplasty, with improvement of both short- and long-term results.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10350112/

Two groups of patients were recruited over the same period. The vigabatrin monotherapy group comprised 40 patients (18 male, 22 female; mean age at last visit 7.5 years); the comparative carbamazepine monotherapy group comprised 40 consecutive clinic patients (22 male, 18 female; mean age at last visit 7.8 years). Seizures disappeared in 82% of vigabatrin patients and in all carbamazepine patients with idiopathic partial epilepsy, and in 50% of vigabatrin patients and 55% of carbamazepine patients with symptomatic partial epilepsy. Interictal EEG abnormalities decreased in vigabatrin patients more than in carbamazepine patients (P < 0.05). Tolerability was good in vigabatrin patients, but four out of 37 showed mild irritability by the end of the trial. Persistent sedation was observed in eight of the 40 patients receiving carbamazepine. No patient had drug therapy discontinued because of side-effects. During vigabatrin long-term monotherapy, efficacy and good clinical tolerability were maintained. These results suggest that vigabatrin may be an alternative first-line treatment for childhood partial epilepsies.

The basic requirements for a monitoring index are definite response, gradual scaling and independence from the anaesthetic technique used. Additionally the index should be predictive for appearance of clinical signs of an inadequate anaesthesia. Different signal-processing methods will be discussed to extract the relevant information from both the spontaneous and the evoked brain electrical activity. In this context well established methods like spectral analysis are investigated in combination with new and more sophisticated methods like bispectral analysis or wavelet decomposition. Since no single-parameter index has been defined for monitoring depth of anaesthesia, a set of EEG parameters may be more useful to take into account intra- and interindividual variability. In parallel to the description of the monitor concept, the investigation of neural nets and fuzzy techniques, in addition to or in substitution of conventional statistical methods, will be introduced. Examples are given for data quality assessment, parameter extraction and re-classification.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10224216/

This study assessed the sensitivity of different surrogates of sedation to clinically relevant sleepiness induced by sleep deprivation. Nine healthy volunteers completed a balanced three-way cross-over study with 1-week wash-out periods. Adaptive tracking, smooth-pursuit and saccadic eye movements, body sway, digit symbol substitution (DSST), visual analogue scales (VAS) and electroencephalograms (EEG) were evaluated on three occasions: (1) during the day after normal sleep, (2) during wakefulness at night; and (3) during the day after a night of sleep deprivation. VAS of alertness showed a gradual decline at night and a constant average reduction of 38 percent [95% Confidence intervals (CI), 28-47%] during the day after sleep deprivation. Average mood scores diminished by 14 percent (95%, CI 2-24%) during the day after sleep deprivation. Adaptive tracking, saccadic eye movements and body sway tended to deteriorate at night, but overall this was not statistically significant. After a night of sleep deprivation, adaptive tracking decreased by 21 percent (95% CI, 11-30%), saccadic eye movements decreased by 9-10 percent (95% CI, 5-13%/6-15%) and body sway increased by 37 percent (95% CI, 5-79%). In contrast, EEG beta2-amplitudes declined significantly at night by 18 percent (95% CI, 6-29%), without changes during the day after sleep deprivation. Smooth pursuit, DSST and other EEG-amplitudes remained unchanged. These results emphasize that reductions in adaptive tracking, saccadic peak velocity and body sway caused by sedative drugs really reflect sedation. They also provide a level of clinical significance for these surrogates of sedation. EEG parameters and smooth pursuit were unaffected by sleep deprivation, so drug-induced changes in these measures may not reflect sedation in a stricter sense. The motivation and alertness necessary for DSST may overcome mild sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10221355/

We compared tramadol with morphine, administered during wound-closure, surmising that tramadol may cause earlier awakening, more rapid recovery, less respiratory depression and equivalent pain relief. Forty patients received nitrous oxide-enflurane for abdominal surgery. At wound closure, patients received tramadol 3 mg kg-1 or morphine 0.2 mg kg-1 and end-tidal enflurane concentrations were maintained at 0.5 kPa until skin closure, whereupon anaesthesia was discontinued. Times to spontaneous respiration, awakening and orientation were similar in the two groups, as were blood-gas tensions, ventilatory frequency, pain scores and incidence of nausea. Half of each group required supplementary analgesia during their 90-min stay in the recovery room. P-deletion counts improved more rapidly in the tramadol group. This study confirms previous reports that tramadol did not antagonize the hypnotic effects of volatile anaesthetics. Tramadol, administered during operation, was as effective as morphine in providing postoperative analgesia while permitting more rapid psychomotor recovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10193286/

In this study, the relation between the hypnotic endpoints of unresponsiveness to verbal commands, loss of eyelash reflex and body movement response to mechanical nasal membrane stimulation vs. bispectral index, 95% spectral edge frequency and median frequency during propofol anaesthesia with or without fentanyl is presented. Forty-two patients were randomly assigned to receive either propofol infusion, 30 mg kg-1 h-1 (n = 22), or propofol infusion, 30 mg kg-1 h-1 + fentanyl bolus, 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v. (n = 20). Bispectral index, 95% spectral edge frequency and median frequency and propofol doses were monitored and recorded at unresponsiveness to verbal commands, loss of eyelash reflex and inhibition of nasal body movement response. The bispectral index values were significantly higher in the propofol + fentanyl compared with the propofol group, i.e. 74.7 +/- 10.9, 73.1 +/- 10.5 and 47.1 +/- 9.2 vs. 65.8 +/- 9.8, 59.6 +/- 10 and 33.8 +/- 5.7 at unresponsiveness to verbal commands, loss of eyelash reflex and inhibition of nasal body movement response respectively. Doses of propofol for achieving the hypnotic endpoints were significantly lower in the propofol + fentanyl compared with the propofol group. Plasma propofol concentrations at inhibition of nasal body movement response were lower in the propofol + fentanyl compared with the propofol group (9.2 +/- 2.0 micrograms mL-1 vs. 14.1 +/- 4.2 micrograms mL-1).

10084098,Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring during propofol-induced sedation and anaesthesia.,European journal of anaesthesiology,1999,Singh H,"One may have to use a monitor of cortical suppression to maintain the optimal level of sedation and hypnosis. The bispectral index (BIS), a processed EEG parameter, which incorporates coupling along with the frequency and amplitude of EEG waveforms, has been proposed as a measure of the pharmacodynamic anaesthetic effect on the central nervous system. The numerical value of BIS varies from 0 to 100 (no cerebral activity to fully awake patient). In order to achieve the desired level of propofol sedation or hypnosis, a target concentration of propofol at the effect site or in the blood must be delivered. Alternately, one may use BIS monitoring to monitor hypnosis or sedation levels or to reflect propofol concentrations in the blood. Significant correlations between plasma propofol concentrations and BIS values (r = 0.68-0.78) have been reported by many investigators. During propofol-induced sedation, BIS values may be maintained above 75 to prevent airway obstruction and hypoxia. During propofol intravenous anaesthesia, BIS values from 40 to 60 have been proposed to maintain the desired level of hypnosis, with values below 50 associated with an insignificant probability of recall. However, the major limitation of the BIS monitor (monitor of hypnosis) relates to the fact that balanced anaesthesia comprises hypnosis, areflexia and analgesia and requires the administration of hypnotic agents, muscle relaxants and analgesics to achieve the desired clinical effects. Therefore, besides using the BIS value guidelines, one may also consider the haemodynamic, autonomic and somatic responses of the patient, the anaesthetic technique and the surgical interventions before deriving definite conclusions about the overall anaesthetic state of the patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10084098/

In light of the efficacy and success achieved in this experience, advanced age does not seem in itself to contraindicate the performance of CEA; the surgical risk for elderly patients appears sufficiently low to justify the operation.

We collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data from five subjects during the early part of the night, comparing the changes in the BIS with the conventional EEG stages of sleep.

Light sleep occurred at BIS values of 75-90, slow-wave sleep occurred at BIS values of 20-70, and rapid eye movement sleep occurred at BIS values of 75-92. The effects of natural sleep on the BIS seem to be similar to the effects of general anesthesia on the BIS. The BIS may have a role in monitoring depth of sleep.
Electroencephalographic data were collected from five subjects during sleep.

The aim of EEG analysis was the characterization and quantification of the interrelations between distinct frequency components in both states of sedation. The data for the investigations were derived from the routine EEG derivations of 12 patients with various neurosurgical diseases. It can be demonstrated that the degree of interrelation (amplitude modulation) between a low-frequency component (0-2.5 Hz) and oscillations with higher frequency (3-7.5 and 8-12 Hz) is increased in burst patterns during BSP compared with the EEG during basic sedation. It can be concluded that the degree of interrelations depends on the sedation depth induced by hypnotic drugs.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10027698/

Forty-eight patients received either propofol infusion, 30 mg.kg-1.h-1 (Group P; n = 12) or ketamine bolus, 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 mg i.v., followed by propofol infusion, 30 mg.kg-1.h-1 + variable dose ketamine infusion, 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 mg.kg-1.h-1 (Groups PK0.25, PK0.5 and PK0.75; n = 12 each) until UVC, LER and INBMR. BIS, 95% SEF and MF values were monitored and recorded at the endpoints of hypnosis. Propofol and ketamine concentrations were measured at INBMR.

Our results suggest additive interaction between propofol and ketamine (Groups PK0.5 and PK0.75) for achieving the hypnotic endpoints; however, ketamine did not depress the EEG variables in proportion to its hypnotic effect.

We investigated the effects of PAN on plasma cytokine and soluble cytokine receptor levels and blood cell counts during 4 weeks in ten patients out of the previous study sample. Under PAN treatment, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble TNF receptors p55 and p75, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels were not increased and neither were monocyte and lymphocyte counts affected. This absence of immunomodulation is in contrast to clozapine, but similar to haloperidol treatment.

MTE is a mostly acute condition, characterized by change of mentation (confusion, delirium, etc.) with little or no neurological deficit but with impressive diffuse EEG slowing. A variety of medical conditions lead to MTE, especially at an age above 50 years, but status-post-surgery (leaving aside cranial neurosurgery, but also cardiac surgery in view of common embolic cerebral pathology) may also result in MTE, especially with the use of general anesthesia. An attempt is made to analyze the plethora of contributory factors and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. All types of classical brain pathology such as strokes, meningitis-encephalitis and typical metabolic encephalopathies (hepatic, renal, etc.) and others must be excluded from the diagnosis of MTE. Special emphasis is being placed on behavioral and EEG criteria in the early state of impaired consciousness with subdivision into 4 types: obtundation, somnolence, morbid lethargy and delirium. Cases of MTE are best picked up by an interdepartmental consultation (liaison) service making use of neurological consultations and EEG assessment. The value of the latter cannot be overestimated in these cases, especially in view of the very limited contributions of neuroimaging methods. The prognosis tends to be good. Severe and fatal developments are usually due to intervening cerebral hypoxia or anoxia. In such a development, epileptic manifestations, which are usually absent or mild in MTE, can become quite prominent. A thorough multi-institutional and international study of MTE is already in the planning stage. It is hoped that preventive measures can minimize the cerebral complications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9891186/
9890387,Is there paradoxical arousal reaction in the EEG subdelta range in patients during anesthesia?,Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,1999,"Litscher G, Schwarz G","Different anesthetic drugs can produce different electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns. Nondrug induced influences, such as surgical stimulation, may also alter the EEG in anesthetized patients. Increases of delta activity are interpreted as signs of deepening of anesthesia. These EEG patterns are sometimes also found in frontal leads after surgical stimulation during isoflurane anesthesia. However, to avoid incorrect anesthetic management under EEG monitoring, this phenomenon of ""paradoxical arousal"" must be taken into consideration. This study demonstrates that, after surgical stimulation, frontal activity was enhanced in the 2-3 Hz and 3-4 Hz frequency bands. On the other hand, in the subdelta range (the 0.05-1 Hz and 1-2 Hz frequency bands), there was an opposite reaction. This significant (p<0.001, according to ANOVA and Dunn's method) reduction of EEG power as a result of the surgical stimuli was found in 25 patients (mean age, 49.1+/-16.3 years) scheduled for elective neurosurgical intervention in the lumbosacral region.

A wide range of BIS was observed, with 15 of the patients having a BIS below 60, indicating a state of deep sedation (or possibly over-sedation).

Regional anesthesia (RA), which consisted of superficial cervical block, was chosen preferentially in 75% of the cases, with general anesthesia (GA) reserved for the patients who did not fulfill the criteria for RA. When available, 8-channel EEG monitoring was performed (59% with RA and 55% with GA).
The EEG was a reliable predictor in comparison with MSE in most but not all cases of cerebral ischemia. Significant neurologic changes were noted using MSE in 4 of 89 patients (4.5%) that were not detected using EEG (false negative results). Conversely, 6 of 89 cases (6.7%) showed unilateral slowing without associated changes in MSE (false positive results). For the awake patients, 21 of 150 cases (14%) showed MSE changes that required a shunt. By contrast, 9 of 32 GA cases (28%) showed EEG changes that would have led to shunting (P = NS). In the RA group, there were no strokes versus 3 of 58 cases (5.2%) with strokes in the GA group. Two of 150 cases (0.1%) had transient ischemic attacks in the RA group. There was 1 myocardial infarction in the GA group; no deaths occurred in this series.
EEG monitoring yielded a significant number of false positive (6.7%) and false negative (4.5%) results in the detection of neurologic deficits when compared with MSE in the awake patients.

Sixty consenting women undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation procedures were studied. After premedication with midazolam 2 mg IV, anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg IV, fentanyl 1.5 microg/kg IV, and succinylcholine 1 mg/kg IV and was initially maintained with either desflurane 4% (n = 31) or a propofol infusion 100 microg kg(-1) min(-1) (n = 29), in combination with nitrous oxide 65% in oxygen. Subsequently, the inspired desflurane concentrations (2%-6%) and propofol infusion rates (50-150 microg.kg(-1) min(-1) were varied to maintain a clinically acceptable depth of anesthesia. The average BIS value during the 3-min interval immediately before the discontinuation of the maintenance anesthetics was recorded. Emergence times and modified Aldrete scores were assessed from the end of anesthesia until patients were considered fast-track-eligible. The BIS values at the end of anesthesia were significantly correlated with the time to reach fast-track eligibility in both the desflurane (r = -0.68) and propofol (r = -0.76) groups. We concluded that the EEG-BIS value at the end of anesthesia is useful in predicting fast-track eligibility after laparoscopic tubal ligation procedures with either a desflurane- or propofol-based anesthetic technique.
In outpatients receiving either desflurane and propofol anesthesia for laparoscopic tubal ligation surgery, the times to achieve criteria for bypassing the recovery room (i.e., fast-tracking) correlated with the electroencephalographic-Bispectral Index values at the end of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9842806/
9841687,Influence of the status of the contralateral carotid artery on the outcome of carotid surgery.,Annals of vascular surgery,1998,"Julia P, Chemla E, Mercier F, Renaudin JM, Fabiani JN","From 1985 to 1995, 747 carotid arteries were operated on in 694 patients, who were under general anesthesia and continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. These patients were divided into three groups according to contralateral carotid status. Group 1 consisted of 58 patients who had contralateral occlusion; group 2, 53 patients who had contralateral stenosis and bilateral staged surgery; and group 3, 583 patients who had nonstenotic contralateral internal carotid artery. All groups were similar with regard to age and sex ratio. There were more asymptomatic patients in group 3 than in group 1 (39.9% vs. 25.8%) (p < 0.05), and less preoperative strokes in group 2 than in the other groups (3.7% vs. 17.2% and 13. 6%, respectively) (p < 0.05). Among risk factors, smoking was less frequent in group 3 (59.5%) than in group 1 (82.7%) and group 2 (77%) (p < 0.01), and coronary artery disease was more frequent in group 2 (60%) than in group 1 (32.7%) and Group 3 (26.4%) (p < 0.01). EEG changes occurred more frequently in group 1 (25.8%) than in group 2 [5.6% (first stage) and 3.8% (second stage)] and in group 3 (4.9%) (p < 0.01). A shunt was used only when EEG changes did not disappear after pharmacologic increasing of central blood pressure, which occurred more frequently in group 1 (10.3%) than in group 2 (0%) and group 3 (0.3%) (p < 0.05). The combined morbidity/mortality rate was similar for groups 1 and 3 (1.7% and 1.5%, respectively), however, transient morbidity was more frequent in group 1 (6.9%) than in group 3 (1.5%) (p < 0.05). The combined morbidity/mortality rate was higher in group 2 than in group 3 (7.5% vs. 1.5%) (p < 0. 05), and all strokes in group 2 were seen during the second-stage operation. In conclusion, contralateral carotid artery occlusion had minimal influence over carotid surgery results. Selective use of a shunt based on EEG monitoring prevented ischemic strokes, with minimal neurologic morbidity. Contralateral carotid stenosis did not affect operative strategy for first stage, but we noted a higher incidence of strokes during the second procedure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9841687/

One purported advantage of etomidate over thiopental is its hemodynamic stability. This study examined the cardiovascular effects of etomidate given for electroencephalographic (EEG) burst suppression during cerebral aneurysm clipping in humans and the direct effects of etomidate on arteries in vitro. The charts of intracranial aneurysm surgery patients were retrospectively reviewed to determine the dose of etomidate employed, the frequency of concurrent vaspressor administration, and whether hemodynamic changes were associated with etomidate use. Against a background of balanced anesthesia, the dose of etomidate to induce burst suppression was 0.73 +/- 0.49 mg/kg (mean +/- SD) and the maintenance dose was 48 +/- 30 microg/kg/min. Etomidate produced an immediate decrease in mean arterial pressure that was sustained in patients who did not receive vasopressor support. During etomidate administration, 48% of patients (10 of 21) received some form of vasopressor support such as phenylephrine or ephedrine, and 62% of patients (13 of 21) receiving isoflurane had the anesthetic discontinued or its inspired concentration decreased. Etomidate in vitro produced dose-dependent relaxation of human internal mammary arterial rings that had been preconstricted by potassium or norepinephrine. Etomidate, in EEG burst suppression doses, decreases mean arterial pressure in anesthetized patients undergoing cerebral aneurysm surgery. One mechanism of etomidate-induced hypotension may be direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, because etomidate directly dilates preconstricted human arteries in vitro.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9796607/

A mathematical model of glutamate, glutamine and ammonia metabolism in the brain has been developed, under the constraints of carbon and nitrogen mass balance, allowing the direct and quantitative comparison of in vivo 13C- and 15N-NMR data. Using this model and 13C-NMR data, the authors have separated the neurotransmitter cycling and detoxification components of glutamine synthesis by measuring the rate of glutamine synthesis under normal and hyperammonaemic conditions in the rat brain cortex in vivo. In addition, the simultaneous measurement of the rates of oxidative glucose metabolism and glutamate neurotransmitter cycling in the rat brain cortex has shown that over a range of EEG activity (from isoelectric up to near-resting levels) the stoichiometry between glucose metabolism and glutamate cycling is close to 1:1. Under mild anesthesia, cortical glucose oxidation coupled to glutamatergic synaptic activity accounts for over 80% of total glucose oxidation. Previously, changes in cerebral glucose metabolism have been taken to indicate alterations in functional activity. These recent in vivo results demonstrate, however, that those changes are, in fact, quantitatively coupled to the crux of functional activity, neurotransmitter release. These findings bear upon a number of hypotheses concerning the neurophysiological basis of brain functional imaging methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9778568/

To increase the number of epileptiform discharges required for MEG analysis, methohexital a short-acting barbiturate that is known to activate epileptiform activity, was used. Additionally, we investigated the spike-provoking properties of clonidine in comparison to methohexital.
After oral premedication with clonidine, short-lasting anesthesia was provided by intravenously administered methohexital. The number and location of epileptiform MEG discharges were assessed after clonidine premedication and during methohexital anesthesia. Results were compared with baseline MEG recordings.
Methohexital increased the frequency of focal epileptiform discharges in eight of 13 patients (one of the 14 patients did not receive methohexital after premedication with clonidine). Additionally, premedication with clonidine was found to increase focal epileptiform discharges in nine of 14 patients. When compared with baseline MEG recordings, recordings after treatment with both clonidine premedication and methohexital anesthesia showed a significant increase in the total number of epileptiform signals and the number of spikes contributing to MEG source localizations.
This study confirms the selective proconvulsant effects of methohexital on the epileptogenic focus as suggested previously by EEG and electrocorticogram (ECoG) investigations. Additionally, our data establish for the first time that clonidine increases epileptiform activity in patients with seizure disorders. These results indicate that clonidine is suited as an activating agent for the localization of epileptogenic foci by means of MEG. This effect of clonidine on specific epileptic activity also indicates that clonidine should be used with caution as an antihypertensive drug in patients with seizure disorders.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9776332/

A retrospective review of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomies for carotid occlusive disease was conducted. EEG changes associated with intraoperative ischemia (decreased amplitude, generalized slowing, and loss of fast activity) resulting in the need for an indwelling arterial shunt were recorded for the two anesthesia groups. To determine the similarities or differences between the two groups, the groups were compared regarding age, risk factors, and indications for surgery.
Significant EEG changes were noted in 6 of 96 patients (6.3%) in the local anesthesia group versus 19 of 121 patients (15.7%) in the general anesthesia group. EEG changes consisted solely of generalized slowing in the local anesthesia group, whereas a more varied spectrum was observed in the general anesthesia group. The two groups were similar regarding age and risk factors. Although the local anesthesia group had more asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients did not have a greater incidence of EEG changes.
There is a large difference in EEG changes potentially requiring shunt placement in patients undergoing surgery while under local (6.3%) versus general (15.7%) anesthesia. This could not be explained based on age, risk factors, interpretation of EEG findings, or indications between the two groups. We conclude that EEG monitoring may be insensitive and may fail to detect ischemia in patients who are under regional anesthesia. Alternately, the presence of general anesthetics may alter the character of the EEG findings and increase the sensitivity of EEG monitoring to ischemic events.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9766302/
9751278,Electrophysiological correlates of sleep delta waves.,Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology,1998,"Amzica F, Steriade M","Recent studies have disclosed several oscillations occurring during resting sleep within the frequency range of the classical delta band (0.5-4 Hz). There are at least 3 oscillations with distinct mechanisms and sites of origin: a slow (<1 Hz) cortically-generated oscillation, a clock-like thalamic oscillation (1-4 Hz), and a cortical oscillation (1-4 Hz). The present paper reviews data on these oscillations and the possible mechanisms which coalesce them into the polymorphic waves of slow wave sleep. Data stem from intracellular (over 500 single cell and 50 double impalements) and field potentials recorded from the cortex and thalamus of cats (120 animals) under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia. Other experiments were based on whole night EEG recordings from humans (5 subjects). The frequency of the slow oscillation both in anesthetized animals and in naturally sleeping humans ranged between 0.1 and 1 Hz (89% of the cases being between 0.5 and 0.9 Hz). The slow (<1 Hz) oscillation is reflected in the EEG as rhythmic sequences of surface-negative waves (associated with hyperpolarizations of deeply-lying neurons) and surface-positive K-complexes (representing excitation in large pools of cortical neurons). Through its long-range synchronization, the slow oscillation has the ability to trigger and to group thalamically-generated spindles and two delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations. Finally, it is argued that the analysis of the electroencephalogram should transcend the spectral analyses, by taking into account the shape of the waves and, when possible, the basic mechanisms that generate those waves.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9751278/

The authors sought to characterize the effects of N2O on quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) variables including the bispectral index (BIS), a quantitative parameter developed to correlate with the level of sedation induced by a variety of agents.
Healthy young adult volunteers (n = 13) were given a randomized sequence of N2O/O2 combinations via face mask. Five concentrations of N2O (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% atm) were administered for 15 min (20 min for the first step). EEG was recorded from bilateral frontal poles continuously. At the end of each exposure, level of sedation was assessed using primarily the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale.
One subject withdrew from the study because of emesis at 50% N2O. N2O (50%) increased theta, beta, 40-50 Hz, and 70-110 Hz band powers. BIS and spectral edge frequency during 50% N2O/O2 did not differ significantly from baseline values. Abrupt decreases from higher to lower concentrations frequently evoked a profound, transient slowing of activity. No significant change in OAA/S was detected during the study.
Although the spectral content of the EEG changed during N2O administration, reflecting some pharmacologic effect, the subjects remained cooperative and responsive throughout, and therefore N2O can only be considered a weak sedative at the tested concentrations. Despite changes in the lower and higher frequency ranges of EEG activity, the BIS did not change, which is consistent with its design objective as a specific measure of hypnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9743404/
9726194,Awareness during general anesthesia: new technology for an old problem.,CRNA : the clinical forum for nurse anesthetists,1998,Halliburton JR,"The possibility of awareness during general anesthesia causes apprehension for the patient and the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA). The goals of general anesthesia are to prevent the sensation of pain and produce a state of sedation, hypnosis, and unconsciousness so the patient will not remember the surgical procedure. An inadequate level of anesthesia can result in patient awareness during surgery. The current practice of anesthesia relies on indirect hemodynamic measurements such as blood pressure and heart rate to monitor the sedative hypnotic state of the patient's brain during general anesthesia. Hemodynamic responses are not reliable for predicting awareness just as blood pressure and heart rate are not indicative of consciousness. Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms are known to be affected by anesthetics. Characteristic EEG waveforms are a direct indication of the patient's level of consciousness. Unprocessed and computer-processed EEG recordings have been used in an attempt to monitor the patient's level of consciousness during general anesthesia. A raw or unprocessed EEG recording to monitor the level of consciousness during general anesthesia is problematic. The EEG signal is complex, affected by artifact, and it requires a dedicated interpreter. Conventional processed EEG monitoring systems are problematic because of the complexity of the equipment and technical difficulty of reading the EEG recording. The purpose of this article is to describe the history of awareness during anesthesia and introduce a new processed EEG monitor, the Bispectral Index (BIS) (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Natick, MA) with implications for future clinical use and research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9726194/

Volunteers underwent functional brain imaging using the 18fluorodeoxyglucose technique; one scan always assessed awake-baseline cerebral metabolism (n = 7), and the other scans assessed metabolism during propofol sedation (n = 4), propofol anesthesia (n = 4), or isoflurane anesthesia (n = 5). The EEG was recorded continuously during metabolism assessment using a frontal-mastoid montage. Power spectrum variables, median frequency, 95% spectral edge, and bispectral index (BIS) values subsequently were correlated with the percentage of absolute cerebral metabolic reduction (PACMR) of glucose utilization caused by anesthesia.
The percentage of absolute cerebral metabolic reduction, evident during anesthesia, trended median frequency (r = -0.46, P = 0.11), and the spectral edge (r = -0.52, P = 0.07), and correlated with anesthetic type (r = -0.70, P < 0.05), relative beta power (r = -0.60, P < 0.05), total power (r = 0.71,P < 0.01), and bispectral index (r = -0.81,P < 0.001). After controlling for anesthetic type, only bispectral index (r = 0.40, P = 0.08) and alpha power (r = 0.37, P = 0.10) approached significance for explaining residual percentage of absolute cerebral metabolic reduction prediction error.
Some EEG descriptors correlated linearly with the magnitude of the cerebral metabolic reduction caused by propofol and isoflurane anesthesia.

After premedication with clonidine 5 microg/kg p.o. (Group C, n = 11), lorazepam 60 microg/kg p.o. (Group L, n = 13), or morphine 0.1 mg/kg plus scopolamine 6 microg/kg i.m. (Group M, n = 11), sedation, anxiety, and quality of premedication were graded. After the administration of sufentanil 2.0 microg/kg over 12.5 min, a computer-assisted infusion device targeted a sufentanil effect-site concentration of 0.75 ng/mL. Hemodynamic variables, end-tidal isoflurane concentration (ET-ISO), the electroencephalographic spectral edge, and the serum sufentanil concentration (SUF) were measured. There were no intergroup differences in anxiety, sedation, quality of premedication, the dose of sufentanil causing unconsciousness, or the electroencephalographic (EEG) response to induction. Intraoperative SUF was stable, with no intergroup difference. The average prebypass ET-ISO was lower in Group C than in Group M. The ET-ISO and peak ET-ISO after intense surgical stimulation were lower in Group C versus Groups L and M. Mean arterial blood pressure was lower in Group C versus Groups L and M. There were no intergroup differences in pharmacologic intervention, time to extubation, or intensive care unit stay. Clonidine produces sedation, anxiolysis, and quality of premedication comparable to conventional premedication. Compared with other drugs, clonidine does not alter the dose of sufentanil inducing unconsciousness or EEG slowing, but it uniquely reduces isoflurane requirements.
In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, clonidine produces sedation and relieves anxiety as effectively as conventional premedication.

To increase the number of epileptic discharges required for MEG analysis, we administered methohexital (MHT), a short-acting barbiturate known to provoke epileptic activity. We also investigated the spike-provoking properties of clonidine in comparison with MHT.
Patients were briefly anesthetized with intravenously administered MHT after being premedicated orally with clonidine. Numbers and locations of epileptic MEG discharges were assessed after clonidine premedication as well as during MHT anesthesia. Results were compared with baseline MEG recordings.
MHT increased the frequency of focal epileptic discharges in 8 of 13 patients ( of the 14 patients did not receive MHT after premedication with clonidine). Premedication with clonidine also increased focal epileptic discharges in 9 of 14 patients. The numbers of epileptic signals and numbers of spikes contributing to MEG source localizations were significantly increased in MEG recordings under both treatment conditions (clonidine premedication and MHT anesthesia) as compared with baseline MEG recordings.
Our results confirmed the selective proconvulsive effects of MHT on the epileptic focus, as previously suggested by EEG and electrocorticographic (ECoG) investigations. However, our present data establish for the first time that clonidine increases epileptic activity in patients with seizure disorders and indicate that clonidine is suitable as an activating agent for localization of epileptogenic foci by MEG.

Critical to the latter is the ability to afford intraoperative neuroprotection during carotid cross-clamping, although the optimal strategy to assure this protection remains debated. This report describes the impact of adding preoperative colloid volume expansion to a surgical algorithm that includes electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and barbiturate-induced burst suppression for EEG lateralization refractory to hypertension.
The incidence of ischemic EEG change during carotid cross-clamping was observed. The results of an initial series of patients (n = 45) reported before incorporation of volume expansion were compared with the results of the current series (n = 155) of carotid endarterectomies, which included preoperative volume expansion with 6% hetastarch (500 or 1000 cc).
With preoperative volume expansion, there was a 40% decrease in the incidence of EEG lateralization during carotid cross-clamping (17.4 versus 28.9%, P < 0.05) and a 63% decrease in the EEG lateralization refractory to induced hypertension (5.8 versus 15.6%, P < 0.05).

The commonly used anesthetic agents and their effects on intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potentials (EP) are discussed. Halogenated inhalational anesthetics produce dose-related reduction in EEG amplitude and frequency after an initial activation. They also produce dose-related decreases in amplitude and increases in latency of sensory evoked potentials (SEP) that are most marked in cortically generated components. Subcortical, spinal, and peripheral evoked responses are less affected. Responses in the motor pathways are recordable in the epidural space; however, the relative contributions of sensory and motor tracts may be changed when both are present. Muscle responses are easily suppressed after spinal and motor cortex stimulation, probably by anesthetic effect at the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. Intravenous analgesic agents (opioids, ketamine) are associated with less marked changes in EEG and evoked responses, with some increases in amplitude of cortically generated SEP caused by ketamine. Intravenous sedative-hypnotic drugs (droperidol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, etomidate, propofol) produce dose-related depression of the EEG after initial activation and dose-related depression of evoked responses to a lesser extent than do the inhalation agents. Etomidate is associated with amplitude enhancement of EEG and cortically generated SEP. Muscle relaxants have minimal effect on the EEG and SEP. Their use, however, may alter muscle recordings from motor tract stimulation. These effects and their relevance to the choice of agents for specific monitoring techniques are discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9681559/

Neuromonitoring has a threefold purpose: to warn the surgeon that he has to adjust his strategy, to confirm his decision, and to help him improve subsequent procedures. The pathophysiology of intraoperative events liable to alter the EEG or the EPs is first considered. The usefulness of neuromonitoring in preventing neurological complication relies on its ability to detect neurological dysfunction at a reversible stage. This applies especially to ischemia and compressive damage. The anesthetic influences on EEG and EPs are then considered. Knowledge of them is essential to disentangle these neurophysiological alterations due to intraoperative events from those merely due to anesthesia and to use neurophysiological parameters to evaluate the depth of anesthesia. Third, the main indications and limitations of neuromonitoring are considered: prevention of ischemic brain or spinal cord damage, prevention of mechanical injuries of the brain, spinal cord or peripheral nerve, and localization of the motor cortex in cortical neurosurgery or of cranial nerves in posterior fossa surgery. Finally, the 3 levels of neuromonitoring (neurophysiological feature extraction, neurophysiological pattern recognition, clinical integration of the neurophysiological patterns) are discussed together with the rules that should guide the dialogue between the surgeon, the anesthesiologist, and the neurophysiologist.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9680160/

Most patients are of Ashkenazi-Jewish ancestry. The EEG findings in this syndrome have not been characterized.
We analyzed the EEGs of 10 patients with the diagnosis of ML IV, aged between of 2.5 and 21 years. All patients had 21 channel recordings in the international 10/20 system without sedation.
Six of the 10 patients had slowing of the background in the theta frequency range, and 4 had excessive beta frequency activity without the administration of medications. Two patients were able to reach stage 2 sleep, and were noted to have both synchronous and asynchronous spindles and vertex waves. Of the 10 patients, 6 had epileptiform spikes, all of which were noted frequently. The location of the spikes varied, from the frontal and temporal regions to the central regions, although location was consistent in each patient.

Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane at a FiO2 of 0.4. At 1 MAC isoflurane the patients were randomly given either intravenous clonidine 2 microg kg(-1) (ten patients) or saline (ten patients). Finally, the isoflurane concentration was increased to a point at which a burst-suppression pattern appeared in the EEG. SEPs upon median nerve stimulation were recorded (1) before induction of anesthesia, (2) at 1 MAC before clonidine/saline, (3) at 1 MAC after clonidine/saline, (4) at EEG burst-suppression.
The cortical SEP amplitude was attenuated from 3.7 (2.0) microV to 2.1 (1.3) microV (p < 0.001) and the peak latency increased from 19.3 (1.1) ms to 22.0 (1.3) ms (p < 0.0001) during 1 MAC isoflurane anesthesia, but the addition of clonidine did not further increase these changes. The isoflurane end-tidal concentration needed to induce burst-suppression EEG was not significantly different in the clonidine group compared with the placebo group (2.0% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.07).
The effect of clonidine in reducing the requirements of anesthetics during general anesthesia is not seen in the cortical SEPs. The isoflurane-induced burst-suppression in the EEG was not affected by clonidine, suggesting that the EEG effects of clonidine and isoflurane were not additive. If SEPs are monitored intraoperatively, clonidine can be used as an adjuvant during isoflurane anesthesia without harmful effects on SEP monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9676863/
9661538,Changes in cerebral oxygen uptake and cerebral electrical activity during defibrillation threshold testing.,Anesthesia and analgesia,1998,"de Vries JW, Bakker PF, Visser GH, Diephuis JC, van Huffelen AC","During cardioverter-defibrillator implantation, repeated episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) are induced. Insufficient recovery of oxygen metabolism may cause neurological sequelae. In this prospective clinical study, we monitored the electroencephalogram (EEG), middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (Vmca), and jugular bulb oxygen saturation and estimated cerebral oxygen uptake. Results were analyzed for tests requiring a single shock (Group 1) and tests requiring multiple shocks for defibrillation (Group 2). Immediately after the induction of VF, the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decreased to < 30 mm Hg, and the Vmca decreased to 0 cm/s. The EEG showed ischemic changes consisting of a decrease of fast, and an increase of slow, activity, progressively declining to isoelectricity within 11 +/- 2 s. After defibrillation, the MAP recovered rapidly regardless of the arrest duration (3 +/- 2 s). The EEG recovered within 17 +/- 9 and 22 +/- 12 s, respectively, for Groups 1 and 2 (P < 0.05) and did not reveal ischemic changes until induction of a subsequent arrest. In Group 1, the cerebral oxygen uptake increased to 191% +/- 31% of baseline values and returned to baseline in 16 +/- 7 s, whereas in Group 2, it increased to 229% +/- 38% (P < 0.05), followed by a significant decrease to less than baseline (85% +/- 18%; P < 0.005), and returned to baseline simultaneously with the Vmca. We conclude that, although restoration to normal of the EEG and cerebral oxygen uptake coincide in short arrests, EEG recovery underestimates metabolic recovery after tests requiring multiple shocks.
Short test intervals have been mentioned as a cause of neurological sequelae after cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. This study demonstrates that although all systemic hemodynamic variables and the electrocardiogram may have returned to normal, cerebral oxygen uptake may still be depressed for a considerable time, especially after tests requiring two or more shocks.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9661538/

Significant differences were observed between agents for mean postictal pulse and blood pressure values. With methohexital, there was a clear postictal increase of mean blood pressure from 126/78 mm Hg to 161/102 mm Hg, whereas there was no increase with propofol (p = 0.00), and with methohexital, a postictal increase of the mean pulse rate from 81 to 90 beats/min and a slight decrease with propofol (79 to 78 beats/min). There were no differences in the SpO2 and ETCO2. The mean seizure duration for unilateral treatments was significantly longer with methohexital (52.7 s) compared with propofol (34.1 s; p = 0.000), but there was no difference for the seizure-quality measures: postictal suppression index (propofol 79.7%, methohexital 77.4%) and mean integrated amplitude (30.2/31.8) were the same for both anesthetic agents.

9647142,Neurologic sequelae associated with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,1998,Hickey PR,"Earlier studies of the incidence of neurologic disturbances after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest produced conflicting results. This article reviews the results of the Boston Circulatory Arrest Study, and another study undertaken to compare neurologic outcome in infants after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest using alpha-stat and pH-stat strategies.
The study population in the Boston Circulatory Arrest Study consisted of 171 infants less than 3 months of age. Neurologic outcomes were evaluated perioperatively, at 1 year, and at 4 years. The study population in the alpha-stat versus pH-stat study consisted of 182 infants no older than 9 months of age. Patients were evaluated for postoperative electroencephalographic (EEG) and clinical seizures, recovery time to first EEG activity, and postoperative mortality and morbidity.
After about 30 minutes of circulatory arrest there was increasing probability of perioperative clinical seizures, EEG seizures, and increased time to recovery of EEG activity. One-year evaluations showed a significant relation of duration of circulatory arrest to lowered psychomotor developmental index and increased neurologic abnormalities. Four-year evaluations showed no difference between low-flow and circulatory-arrest patients in results of neurologic examination or in full-scale general IQ, although there was an effect of circulatory arrest duration on various subscores of cognitive function. Compared with the pH-stat strategy, the alpha-stat strategy tended to be associated with more EEG seizures and higher postoperative morbidity and mortality, and was significantly associated with longer recovery time to first EEG activity.
These studies strongly suggest that in infants undergoing open heart operations for complex congenital heart defects, low-flow bypass is associated with better neurologic outcome than is circulatory arrest and that the pH-stat strategy is associated with a better outcome than the alpha-stat strategy when circulatory arrest is used.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9647142/

The monitor uses bispectral analysis to derive an index of anaesthetic depth, the bispectral index (BIS). We compared reliability, impedance and BIS for each montage. ECG electrodes placed in a bifrontal montage were more reliable than silver dome electrodes in a fronto-central montage and both types of electrodes had impedances in the clinically useful range. However, BIS values derived from each montage were found to differ in an unpredictable manner. The bifrontal montage is easy to apply and reliable but it is not comparable with a fronto-central montage.

In a logistic regression model, spectral edge frequency was a significant determinant of both loss of consciousness (p = 0.0006) and movement to skin incision (p = 0.0044), whereas for median frequency no significant prediction model could be established. The probabilities of 50% and 95% no response for spectral edge frequency were 13.4 Hz and 6.8 Hz, respectively.

The N20/P22 wave had the typical form of a negative wave postcentrally, and positive precentrally. The amplitude exceeded 4 microV in all patients, making it easily visible without averaging on the low-amplitude suppression. These results show that two kinds of somatosensory evoked potential can be studied without averaging during EEG suppression in deep anaesthesia. One is the localised N20/P22 wave, which is seen regularly during suppression after stimuli with intervals exceeding 1 s. The other is the burst, involving the whole cortex, which is not evoked by every stimulus. We suggest that somatosensory evoked potentials can be monitored during sevoflurane-induced EEG suppression, and often can be evaluated reliably from a couple of single sweeps with stimulation interval exceeding 1 s. The enhancement of early cortical components of SEP, their adaptation to repeated stimuli, and the disappearance of later polysynaptic components during EEG suppression, give new possibilities to study the generators of SEP and the different effects of anaesthetics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9607521/

Eight young subjects (mean age 29.8 years) and eight elderly volunteers (mean age 68.4 years) received oral placebo and alprazolam (1.0 mg) in a randomized, double-blind, single-dose crossover study. In the elderly subjects, plasma concentrations were higher, although not significantly so, than in young volunteers 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 hours after dosage. Apparent elimination half-life, time of maximum concentration, maximum concentration, volume of distribution, and apparent clearance were similar for the two groups. In both groups, alprazolam treatment (versus placebo) produced significant changes in typical benzodiazepine agonist effects, such as increased sedation and fatigue, reduced excitement, increased feelings of spaciness, and perception of thinking slowed. For some measures, the alprazolam-placebo difference was greater in young than in elderly subjects. In both groups, alprazolam significantly impaired performance on the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST). EEG studies indicated significant increases in relative beta amplitude (13-30 Hz range) after alprazolam compared to placebo. Percent DSST decrement and percent EEG change were highly correlated with plasma alprazolam concentrations for both groups. There were modest increases in alprazolam plasma concentration in the elderly compared to the younger group shortly after drug administration, but there was no evidence of increased sensitivity to the pharmacodynamic effects of alprazolam in the elderly.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9597554/

Because acute hypertensive responses are often observed immediately after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), we designed a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study to assess the effects of four different oral doses of clonidine (0.05-0.3 mg per os) on the acute hemodynamic response to ECT. Anesthesia was induced with methohexital 1 mg/kg followed by succinylcholine, 1.3 mg/kg i.v. A total of 110 treatments were evaluated in 22 patients. Noninvasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) values, duration of motor and electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure activity, and recovery times were recorded. Clonidine produced a dose-related decrease in MAP before and after ECT. Although clonidine 0.2-0.3 mg per os decreased the peak MAP value after ECT, the changes in MAP from the prestimulation values were similar in all treatment groups. Clonidine produced no significant changes in HR, duration of motor and EEG seizure activity, or recovery times after anesthesia. These data suggest that clonidine decreases the peak MAP value after ECT by decreasing MAP immediately before the ECT stimulus.
Oral clonidine (0.2-0.3 mg) decreases the acute hypertensive response after electroconvulsive therapy; however, this antihypertensive effect was achieved by decreasing the blood pressure before the electrical stimulus.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9585310/
9583568,Central nervous system monitoring during open heart surgery: an update.,Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,1998,Sebel PS,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is used to monitor the function of the central nervous system in a variety of surgical procedures. During cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, ischemic changes on the EEG as a result of impaired central nervous system blood supply can be noted. The EEG also may be used to monitor the functional state of the brain during and after profound hypothermic circulatory arrest. If a desired goal is to reduce cerebral metabolism using a barbiturate or other such agent, the EEG can be monitored to provide a measurable pharmacodynamic end point (burst suppression). Techniques have been developed to process the EEG signal using a computer and to improve on-line interpretation. These include fast Fourier transformation to develop a three-dimensional plot or compressed spectral array, evoked-potential monitoring, and bispectral analysis to derive a univariate descriptor of the EEG. These techniques have been used to detect awareness and indirect memory function, as well as to assess the adequacy of anesthesia. There is a good correlation between implicit memory and alterations in midlatency auditory-evoked responses. The bispectral index has been used to assess the adequacy of anesthesia as well as to detect awareness. Preliminary studies suggest that titrating the anesthetic to bispectral index levels may be useful during cardiac surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9583568/

Critical regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) has been defined as the rCBF below which electroencephalographic (EEG) changes of ischemia occur. This study determined the rCBF50, the rCBF value at which 50% of patients will not demonstrate EEG evidence of cerebral ischemia with carotid cross-clamping.
Fifty-two patients undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy were administered 0.6-1.2% (0.3-0.6 minimum alveolar concentration) sevoflurane in 50% nitrous oxide (N2O). A 16-channel EEG was used for monitoring. The washout curves from intracarotid 133Xenon injections were used to calculate rCBF before and at the time of carotid occlusion by the half-time (t(1/2)) technique. The quality of the EEG with respect to ischemia detection was assessed by an experienced electroencephalographer.
Ischemic EEG changes developed in 5 of 52 patients within 3 min of carotid occlusion at rCBFs of 7, 8, 11, 11, and 13 ml x 100 g(-1) x min(-1). Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate an rCBF50 of 11.5 +/- 1.4 ml x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) for sevoflurane. The EEG signal demonstrated the necessary amplitude, frequency, and stability for the accurate detection of cerebral ischemia in all patients within the range of 0.6-1.2% sevoflurane in 50% N2O.
The rCBF50 of 0.6-1.2% sevoflurane in 50% N2O, as determined using logistic regression analysis, is 11.5 +/- 1.4 ml 100 g(-1) x min(-1).

Fifteen patients (36.6%) were asymptomatic. Medical risk factors included coronary artery disease in 26 (63.4%), hypertension in 22 (53.7%), and smoking in 12 (29.3%). The procedure was performed under EEG monitoring in all patients. General anesthesia was administered in 37 (90%) and regional anesthesia in four (10%). Shunts were used in four (10%) patients. The internal carotid artery was patched in 16 patients (39%). One patient (2.4%) developed a perioperative stroke and only one patient developed perioperative myocardial infarction (MI).

The current study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of three EEG parameters and anesthetic concentration for predicting depth of sedation and anesthesia during sevoflurane anesthesia
One low and one high equilibrated concentration ranging from 0.2-1.8% were assigned randomly and administered consecutively to 69 patients. The bispectral index (BIS; version 3.2), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), and median power frequency (MPF) were obtained from a bipolar frontomastoid (Fp1-A1, Fp2-A2) montage using an EEG monitor. Sedation was assessed using the responsiveness portion of the observer's assessment of alertness-sedation scale. In the second phase of the study, the 47 patients who were scheduled to have skin incisions were observed for purposeful movement in response to skin incision at sevoflurane concentrations between 1.6% and 2.4%. The relation among BIS, 95% SEF, MPF, sevoflurane concentration, sedation score, and movement or no movement after skin incision, was determined. Prediction probability values for EEG parameters and sevoflurane concentration to predict depth of sedation and anesthesia were also calculated.
The BIS and sevoflurane concentration correlated closely with the sedation score. Both 95% SEF and MPF changed significantly but biphasically with increasing sedation. The prediction probability values for BIS and sevoflurane concentration were 0.966 and 0.945, respectively, indicating a high predictive performance for depth of sedation. No EEG parameters predicted movement after skin incision better than chance alone.

EEG analysis included visual inspection, spectral analysis and a recently developed nonlinear analysis (the Kaplan test). All EEGs showed decreased fast activity and an increase of slow wave activity on visual inspection. There was a nonsignificant trend of negative correlation between the spectral EEG analysis and the severity of the acute systemic illness (based on the sum score of 14 variables known as APACHE II score) (standard coefficient = -0.43, p = 0.118).

The EEG abnormalities seen in these patients were independent of the sedation level. Neither the EEG parameters, nor the APACHE II score, predicted outcome. Nonlinear analysis is more powerful than spectral analysis to extract clinical relevant information from EEGs in patients who experience a severe SE. The nonlinear EEG analysis suggest that brain dynamics in SE may be characterized by a shift into a fundamentally different level of cortical information exchange which can be summarized in nonlinear terminology as a loss of deterministic structure in the EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9522343/

There was no recorded value for MF that was 100% specific for unconsciousness. Of the four measurements, only AEP index demonstrated a significant difference (P < 0.05) between all mean values 1 min before recovery of consciousness and all mean values 1 min after recovery of consciousness. Our findings suggest that of the four electrophysiological variables, AEP index was best at distinguishing the transition from unconsciousness to consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9505777/

The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of postoperative cognitive disorders and cerebral hypoperfusion in patients receiving either high dose fentanyl or thiopentone anesthesia in cardiac surgery.
50 unpremedicated patients, Class IIb-NYHA (25 patients in each group suffering from single critical LAD disease) undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting surgery were randomly allocated into two groups either to receive fentanyl 50 microg/kg with diazepam 0.1 mg/kg (Group 1) or thiopentone 7 mg/kg (Group 2) for the induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl 2 microg/kg/hr and diazepam 0.05 mg/kg/hr infusion in Group 1 throughout the procedure. In Group 2, it was maintained with enflurane 0.7-1.5% before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and with thiopentone 3 mg/kg/hr infusion during CPB. Neuropsychiatric evaluation (STAI-T, min mental state examination-MMSE and Zung tests), EEG and SPECT rCBF (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Regional Cerebral Blood Flow) studies were performed preoperatively, early and late postoperatively. The patients that were diagnosed to have postoperative cerebral hypoperfusion also underwent computed tomography scanning postoperatively.
Eleven patients (9 from fentanyl and 2 from thiopentone group) were diagnosed to have cerebral hypoperfusion with respect to SPECT rCBF studies. Seven of these patients (5 from fentanyl and 2 from thiopentone) were diagnosed to be in a state of delirium clinically with MMSE tests.
High dose fentanyl anesthesia causes significant predisposition to postoperative cerebral hypoperfusion when compared with barbiturate anesthesia in cardiac surgery. Hypoperfusion as demonstrated by SPECT rCBF studies may play an important role in the pathophysiology of mental disorders, i.e., postoperative delirium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9501262/

Nine patients who did sleep naturally comprised a comparison group. EEGs were read blind; most were interpreted as mildly abnormal or within normal limits. No statistically significant differences between the three groups were observed in response to photic stimulation, hyperventilation or in frequency of paroxysmal variants. The electroencephalographer was able to identify the melatonin patients significantly more accurately than those who received secobarbital on the basis of lack of EEG manifestations of fast frequencies typical of barbiturate effects. Self-assessments of drowsiness, anxiety and performance on a perceptual-motor task were similar in the melatonin and secobarbital patients. However, the secobarbital group showed more impairment on a locomotion test than those who received melatonin or slept spontaneously. The results suggest that melatonin is a plausible alternative for EEG sleep sedation, especially for ambulatory patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9472426/

With the introduction of muscle relaxing agents, the traditional signs of awareness are often obscured or difficult to interpret. These signs include blood pressure, heart rate, pupil size, etc. However, these factors do not describe the depth of anaesthesia, (DA), in a cerebral activity sense, hence there is a desire to achieve a better measure of the DA. Auditory Evoked Potentials (AEP) provide two aspects relevant to anaesthesia: (1) they have identifiable anatomical significance and, (2) their characteristics reflect the way in which the brain reacts to a stimulus. However, AEP is embedded in noise from the ongoing EEG background activity. Hence, processing is needed to improve the signal to noise ratio. The methods applied were moving time averaging (MTA) and ARX-modeling. The EEG was collected from the left hemisphere and analysed by FFT to 1 sec epochs and the spectral edge frequency was calculated. Both the changes in ARX extracted AEP and the spectral edge frequency of the EEG correlated well with the time interval between propofol induction and onset of anaesthesia measured by clinical signs (i.e., cessation of eye-lash reflex). The MTA extracted AEP was significantly slower in tracing the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9470386/

Intubation was performed five minutes after maintenance of BIS within 45 +/- 5. EEG and haemodynamic variables were recorded at before induction, and before and after intubation.
Haemodynamic responses to intubation were greater in group P than in group PF (P < 0.05). Postintubation SBP, DBP and HR increased, compared with preinduction values, more in group P than in group PF. Postintubation BIS values increased from 45.5 +/- 3.5 and 44.2 +/- 4.1 to 51.1 +/- 4.1 and 50.9 +/- 5.3 in groups P and PF, respectively, compared with preintubation values. The BIS values were not different between treatment groups before and after intubation, and 95% SEF and MF values did not increase after intubation.
Fentanyl, 2 micrograms.kg-1 i.v., blunted the haemodynamic responses to intubation, but failed to attenuate the arousal of cerebral cortical activity.

The purposes of this study were (1) to determine whether BIS correlates with responses to command during sedation and hypnosis induced by propofol or propofol and nitrous oxide, and (2) to compare BIS to targeted and measured concentrations of propofol in predicting participants' responses to commands.
Twenty volunteers (15 men and 5 women, aged 22-50 yr) were given propofol by computer-controlled infusion, and EEG was recorded for off-line analysis of BIS. Responses to randomly ordered verbal commands or voice plus touch were measured with two categorical scales (CS1 and CS2, respectively). All subjects received a propofol infusion targeted to achieve effect site concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, and 0 microg/ml. Ten participants had repeated infusion, whereas 10 others breathed 30% nitrous oxide and oxygen and received a propofol infusion targeted for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0 microg/ml. Five minutes after each targeted concentration had been reached, CS1, CS2, and arterial propofol concentration were determined. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to compare the accuracy of (1) BIS, (2) targeted propofol concentration, (3) measured concentration, and (4) treatment history as predictors of response.
Bispectral index was a strong predictor of CS1 and CS2 (P < 0.0001) and significantly more accurate than targeted or measured propofol concentrations (P < 0.0003 and P < 0.003, respectively). It also provided additional predictive power when combined with treatment history (P < 0.02). Nitrous oxide slightly decreased the probability of response at a given value of BIS (P < 0.05), but accuracy was unaffected.
Bispectral index accurately predicts response to verbal commands during sedation and hypnosis with propofol or propofol plus nitrous oxide. Accuracy is maintained in situations likely to be encountered during clinical use: when propofol concentrations are increasing or decreasing and when repeated measurements are made over time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9447852/

Patients received lidocaine 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg i.v., or saline prior to induction of anesthesia via a standardized anesthetic technique.
Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), as well as the duration of motor and electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure, were measured.

16 ASA physical status I and II patients who underwent general or general plus epidural anesthesia for major orthopedic surgery.
In Group 1 (n = 10), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was decreased to 50 mmHg by increasing the inspired concentration of isoflurane and injecting 75 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine into the epidural catheter. Hematocrit was decreased to 20% by phlebotomy and simultaneous infusion of crystalloid and colloid. In Group 2 (n = 6), isoflurane was adjusted to maintain MAP within 20% of baseline values, and no phlebotomy or hemodilution was used.
Efficacy of hemodilution combined with induced hypotension (Group 1) was compared to standard management of blood volume and pressure (Group 2) by measuring transfusion volume and length of ICU stay. Safety of hemodilution/hypotension was determined by measuring the electroencephalogram, internal jugular venous oxygen saturation, the electrocardiogram, and central venous oxygen saturation. In Group 1, both the volume of homologous blood (225 +/- 150 ml) and total blood (1440 +/- 286 ml) was significantly less than the volume of homologous blood transfused in Group 2 (2650 +/- 878 ml). No patients in Group 1, but all patients in Group 2 required ICU admission (3.5 +/- 1.6 days) for treatment to prevent sequelae from, or progression of, moderate-severe tissue edema and metabolic acidosis.

Twenty healthy male volunteers (aged 24 +/- 5 yr) were included in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (Group 1, placebo, n = 10; Group 2, 2.0 micrograms/kg clonidine, n = 10) study. EEG (17 electrodes, common average reference, fast Fourier transformation, band pass 0.4-35.0 Hz) output was recorded until 145 min after drug infusion. Subjects were intermittently stimulated by verbal commands. Clonidine-related changes resulted in attenuation of the physiological alpha fluctuations seen in untreated subjects and were most pronounced at parietooccipital (P4, O2) recording sites. This was associated with initial maximal increases in slow wave activity (delta) almost uniformly distributed over the whole cortex, restricting with time to occipital regions (O2). The EEG mapping technique may provide more specific information about clonidine-mediated sedative effects, indicating facilitations of EEG patterns that are not homogeneously distributed. These EEG changes cannot be explained by physiologic changes in vigilance or by normal sleep stages because they were not observed after placebo. EEG effects seem to be unrelated to changes in hemodynamics.
In healthy volunteers, placebo-controlled signal changes in the electroencephalogram were evaluated to quantify sedative drug effects after intravenous application of clonidine.

A new technique, foramen ovale electrode (FOE) implantation, was first introduced by Wieser in 1984 for the lateralization of bilateral mesiotemporal lobe (MTL) onset of seizures.
Since October 1993, a multipolar, three-contact FOE has been used in 12 intractable epileptic patients for presurgical evaluation. The reasons for FOE implantation included bilateral MTL onset of seizures recorded by extracranial EEGs in nine patients, and extracranial EEG abnormalities inconsistent with the results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomogram (PET) or Wada test in three patients. Under general anesthesia, the FOEs were implanted according to the technique introduced by Kirschner, using Barters landmarks.
After long-term telemetry recording with FOE, seven patients revealed clear onset of seizures originating from one side of the MTL and underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). Two patients had seizures of bilateral MTL onset. However, they received ATL due to predominantly unilateral interictal epileptiform discharges (EDs) and/or MRI and PET abnormalities. Seven (78%) of the nine operated patients became seizure-free after ATL. Three patients were considered not operable because two had multifocal onset of seizures and one had seizures with independent bilateral MTL onset. No serious complication resulted from implantation of FOE in this series.
The semi-invasive technique of FOE is reliable for lateralization of bilateral MTL onset of seizures which are often not clearly recorded by extracranial EEGs. This procedure is safe and can be an alternative to invasive implantation of depth electrodes and subdural grids.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9419952/

However, reexamination of ketamine is warranted because data regarding the effects of ketamine on cerebral hemodynamics are conflicting.
Eight patients with traumatic brain injury were studied. In all patients, ICP monitoring was instituted before the study. Control of ICP (less than 25 mmHg), hemodynamic values, and blood gas tension (partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood between 35-38 mmHg) was obtained with propofol infusion (3 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) and mechanical ventilation. The effects of three doses of ketamine, 1.5, 3, and 5 mg/kg, respectively, on ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure, jugular vein bulb oxygen saturation, middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, and electric activity of the brain (EEG) were measured. The three doses were administered intravenously at 6-h intervals over 30 s through a central venous line. Systemic and cerebral hemodynamics and end-tidal carbon dioxide were continuously monitored and recorded at 1-min intervals throughout the 30-min study periods.
Ketamine, in all three doses studied (1.5, 3, and 5 mg/kg) was associated with a significant decrease in ICP (mean +/- SD: 2 +/- 0.5 mmHg [P < 0.05], 4 +/- 1 mmHg [P < 0.05], and 5 +/- 2 mmHg [P < 0.05]) among the study patients regardless of the ketamine dose used. There were no significant differences in cerebral perfusion pressure, jugular vein bulb oxygen saturation, and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity. Ketamine induced a low-amplitude fast-activity electroencephalogram, with marked depression, such as burst suppression.
These results suggest that ketamine may not adversely alter cerebral hemodynamics of mechanically ventilated head-trauma patients sedated with propofol. These encouraging results should be confirmed in larger groups of similar patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9416717/

We evaluated the effect of desflurane on brain tissue oxygen pressure (PO2), carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2) and pH during neurosurgery.
Following a craniotomy, the dura was opened and a Paratrend 7 sensor, which measures PO2, PCO2, pH and temperature, was inserted into brain tissue. In 6 control patients in group 1, anesthesia was maintained constant with 3% end-tidal desflurane over 60 min, including a 30-min stabilization period. In group 2, 9 patients were ventilated with 3% desflurane under baseline conditions. After a 30-min stabilization period, baseline tissue gases and pH were measured and end-tidal desflurane was increased to 6% and then 9% for 15-min intervals. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was maintained with intravenous phenylephrine.
Under baseline conditions, cardiovascular and brain tissue measures were similar between the 2 groups. Increasing end-tidal desflurane from 3% to 9% produced burst-suppression EEG in all patients and significantly increased tissue PO2 and pH and decreased PCO2. No parameters changed significantly in the control group during steady-state anesthesia.

This study determined whether addition of BIS monitoring to standard anesthetic practice results in improvements in the conduct of anesthesia or in patient outcomes.
Three hundred two patients receiving a propofol-alfentanil-nitrous oxide anesthetic were studied at four institutions. Thirty-four patients were initially enrolled to determine preexisting anesthetic practice and patient outcomes at each institution. Subsequent patients were randomized to either standard clinical practice (SP group), or standard practice plus BIS monitoring (BIS group). In all patients, the anesthesiologist attempted to provide a stable anesthetic with the fastest possible recovery. BIS was recorded for all patients, but viewed only in the BIS group. In the BIS group, propofol infusions were adjusted to achieve a target BIS between 45-60, increasing to 60-75 during the final 15 min of the case. In the SP group, propofol dose adjustments were made based only on standard clinical signs. Drug use, intraoperative responses, and patient recovery parameters were recorded.
Demographics were similar between groups. Compared with the SP group, patients in the BIS group required lower normalized propofol infusion rates (134 vs. 116 microg x kg[-1] x min[-1]; P < 0.001), were extubated sooner (11.22 vs. 7.25 min; P < 0.003), had a higher percentage of patients oriented on arrival to PACU (43% vs. 23%; P < 0.02), had better postanesthesia care unit (PACU) nursing assessments (P < 0.001), and became eligible for discharge sooner (37.77 vs. 31.70 min; P <0.04). There was no significant difference in the incidence of intraoperative responses between the groups.
Titrating propofol with BIS monitoring during balanced anesthesia decreased propofol use and significantly improved recovery. Intraoperative course was not changed. These findings indicate that the use of BIS may be valuable in guiding the administration of propofol intraoperatively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9357882/

Since propofol is administered for both sedation and hypnosis, it is important to understand the effects of low (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) and high (2-2.5 mg/kg) doses of propofol on the electroencephalogram (EEG). In this study, the hemodynamic and EEG effects of cumulative doses of propofol from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/kg i.v. were studied in 30 neurosurgical patients with or without a history of seizure disorders. While continuously recording from scalp EEG electrodes (F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, and O2), propofol 0.5 mg/kg was infused intravenously over 20 s. The same dose of propofol was reinjected four times at 2-min intervals, until a total dose of 2.5 mg/kg had been administered. The number and average amplitude of the EEG waves were counted and measured manually, respectively, from 80 to 90 s after beginning the injection of each dose of propofol. After lower propofol doses (0.5-1 mg/kg), the number of beta-waves increased, while alpha- and theta-waves decreased significantly in all patients. However, with larger doses of propofol (total dose of 2-2.5 mg/kg), the number of beta-waves decreased and delta-waves appeared. The amplitudes of all EEG waves increased and were maintained at a higher level after administration of propofol. Spike (or sharp) waves appeared in 33% of the control patients and in 40% of the epileptic group after propofol 0.5 mg/kg and in 73% of the control and 67% of the epileptic patients after the 1.5-mg/kg dose. In the majority of patients, the spike waves disappeared when additional doses of propofol were administered. One patient in the epileptic group had an EEG-recorded and clinical grand mal seizure after propofol 1 mg/kg, but the seizure disappeared after an additional 0.5-mg/kg bolus dose was administered. The propofol-induced EEG changes appeared initially at the frontal and central EEG electrodes and subsequently at the other EEG electrodes. Overall, there were no significant differences in the spectrum of EEG changes between the two patient populations. It is concluded that propofol produces similar dose-dependent effects on EEG activity in patients with or without a history of seizure disorders. While induction of anesthesia with higher doses of propofol (> 1.5 mg/kg) in neurosurgical patients with well controlled seizure disorder is safe, smaller sedative doses should be administered with caution to epileptic patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9339406/

The EEG indicated ischemic changes, ranging from occurrence of rhythmic delta activity to cessation of all electrical activity. On successful defibrillation the rSO2 increased to values in excess of pre-arrest levels and restored towards baseline; the SjO2 initially fell followed by a similar overshoot. Recovery times increased in proportion to arrest duration.
Short lasting episodes of circulatory arrest have serious, but transient effects on brain function. The rSO2 is an effective non-invasive tool for monitoring cerebral oxygenation during DFT-testing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9338844/
9316956,"Blood flow velocity of middle cerebral artery during prolonged anesthesia with halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane in humans.",Anesthesiology,1997,"Kuroda Y, Murakami M, Tsuruta J, Murakawa T, Sakabe T","It is not clear whether the increase of cerebral blood flow (CBF) produced by volatile anesthetics is maintained during prolonged anesthesia. In a previous study, the authors found that CBF equivalent, an index of flow-metabolism relationship, was stable over 3 h, suggesting no decay over time in CBF for 3 h during volatile anesthesia in humans. However, it may be possible that CBF changes in a parallel fashion to functional metabolic changes. In this study, to estimate the response of CBF to three volatile anesthetics, the authors used transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography to measure time-averaged mean velocity in the middle cerebral artery (Vmca).
Twenty-four surgical patients were randomly assigned to three groups to receive halothane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane (eight patients, each). End-tidal concentration of the selected volatile anesthetic was maintained at 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 MAC before surgery and then at 1.5 MAC during surgery, which lasted more than 3 h. Normothermia and normocapnia were maintained. Mean arterial blood pressure was kept above 70 mmHg, using phenylephrine infusion, if necessary. TCD recordings of the Vmca were performed continuously.
Vmca at 0.5 MAC of halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane was 49 +/- 19, 57 +/- 8, and 48 +/- 13 cm/s, respectively. Halothane significantly (P < 0.01) increased Vmca in a dose-dependent manner (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 MAC), whereas isoflurane and sevoflurane produced no significant dose-related changes. At 1.5 MAC for 3 h, Vmca changed significantly (P < 0.05) for the time trends, but it did not exhibit decay over time with all drugs. During burst suppression, observed electroencephalographically (EEG) on patients during isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia, the onset of a burst increased Vmca (approximately 5-30 cm/s), which was maintained for the duration of the burst.
The results indicate that there was no decay in Vmca over time during prolonged (3 h) inhalation of volatile anesthetics at 1.5 MAC in humans. The fluctuation of Vmca during burst suppression on EEG at 1.5 MAC indicates that the flow-metabolism coupling occurred.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9316956/
9305560,Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials during isoflurane anaesthesia.,Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,1997,"Porkkala T, Kaukinen S, Häkkinen V, Jäntti V","The effect of isoflurane on the subcortical P14 component of the median nerve somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) is poorly known. We studied whether the P14 wave from the upper brainstem, recorded with a nasopharyngeal electrode, was attenuated at the isoflurane-induced EEG burst-suppression level. We also compared the effect of isoflurane on the P14, cervical N13 and cortical N20, N35 and N6, components.
Seventeen elective patients were anaesthetized with isoflurane. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded prior to anaesthesia, at 0.5 MAC and 1 MAC end-tidal isoflurane as well as at the level when EEG was in burst-suppression (mean 1.9 vol% end-tidal isoflurane).
Isoflurane had varying effects on the subcortical components of median SEP. The amplitude of nasopharyngeal P14 was stable, but the mean latency increased from 14.4 +/- 1.2 msec at 0.5 MAC to 15.2 +/- 1.1 msec at burst-suppression level (P < 0.05). In contrast, the N13 neck response amplitude was attenuated from 3.3 +/- 0.6 microV to 2.6 +/- 0.5 microV (P < 0.005) without latency changes. The latency of the cortical N20 wave was increased from 19.7 +/- 1.1 msec at awake to 24.4 +/- 1.6 msec at burst-suppression level (P < 0.0001) and amplitude was reduced from 3.3 +/- 1.1 microV to 1.3 +/- 0.6 microV (P < 0.0001). The later cortical components were attenuated even during 0.5 MAC isoflurane and were not recordable during EEG burst-suppression.
We conclude that P14 can reliably be recorded with nasopharyngeal electrodes during isoflurane anaesthesia, even during EEG burst-suppression, when the N20 wave is attenuated. In contrast, the middle-latency SEP components are sensitive to isoflurane anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9305560/

Middle cerebral artery flow velocity (Vmca), intracranial pressure (ICP), electroencephalogram (EEG) activity, and jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation were measured, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and estimated cerebral vascular resistance (CVRe) were calculated at baseline and at 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) sevoflurane (n = 8) or isoflurane (n = 6). Mannitol 0.5-0.75 g/kg was given before dural incision, and blood was sampled for plasma inorganic fluoride during surgery and for up to 72 h postoperatively. Both sevoflurane and isoflurane decreased Vmca (to 31 +/- 12 - 36 +/- 14 cm/s, mean +/- SD), did not significantly alter ICP (13 +/- 9 - 15 +/- 11 mm Hg), and did not cause epileptiform EEG activity. With sevoflurane, decreased Vmca was accompanied by decreased CPP and unchanged CVRe at 0.5 MAC, and unchanged CPP and increased CVRe at 1.0 and 1.5 MAC. Plasma inorganic fluoride was 39.0 +/- 12.9 microM at the end of anesthesia (3.2 +/- 2.0 MAC hours) with sevoflurane, similar to the value (36.2 +/- 3.9 microM) for 3.7 +/- 0.1 MAC hours sevoflurane in patients not receiving mannitol. Decreased Vmca during sevoflurane presumably results from decreased cerebral metabolic rate, with CVRe changing secondarily in accord with CPP. Plasma inorganic fluoride does not seem to be altered by mannitol-induced diuresis.
In neurosurgical patients, sevoflurane decreased middle cerebral artery flow velocity and caused no epileptiform electroencephalogram activity and no increase of intracranial pressure or plasma inorganic fluoride. These effects are suitable for neurosurgery. Two other possible effects of sevoflurane, i.e., increased cerebrospinal fluid volume and/or intracranial elastance, may not be suitable for neurosurgery and warrant further study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9296414/

However, the debate regarding the ""ideal"" anesthetic for CEA remains on-going. This study was designed to evaluate the actual anesthetic techniques used by anesthesiologists for CEA. A total of 426 1-page questionnaires were mailed to all current (1995) members of the Society of Neurosurgical Anesthesia and Critical Care (SNACC). Of these, 216 (50.7%) were completed and returned. The majority of these respondents (84.7%) administered general anesthesia (GA) for CEA. Regional anesthesia (RA) was the anesthetic method of choice for 16.7%, whereas 2.8% each chose either local anesthesia (LOC) or a combined regional/general (RA/GA) technique. Despite the controversial role of nitrous oxide in neuroanesthesia, 74.6% of those returning the survey use nitrous oxide during CEA. Intraoperative neuromonitoring use was reported by 90% of the respondents, with the electroencephalography (EEG) the favored modality (67.5%). Specific intraoperative neuroprotective measures were provided by only 22.2% of all respondents, with barbiturates as the favorite method (50.0%). The technique of intraoperative hypertension is practiced by a majority of those surveyed (61.1%), with the most common target blood pressures being either preoperative baseline or preoperative baseline plus 20%. Although there is some trend towards nonintensive care setting for postoperative care, the intensive care remains the location of choice for overnight care of CEA patients (71.8%). The results of this study show that despite arguments for RA over GA, the majority of anesthesiologists surveyed choose GA for CEA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9239581/

Thirty-nine patients (ASA physical status I or II, 20-68 yr of age) undergoing orthopedic surgery were randomly assigned to receive I.V. saline (n = 20) or I.V. clonidine (3 microg/kg, n = 19). After detection of isoflurane-induced burst suppression, ET ISO was decreased in 0.1% ET steps until burst suppression diminished. Median minimum ET ISO for induction of burst suppression was 1.4% in the saline group and 0.9% in the clonidine group (P < 0.05). Before skin incision, EEG alpha 2 activity was significantly higher in the clonidine group compared with saline group. Fourteen patients (70%) in the saline group and 12 patients (63%) in the clonidine group showed a cardiovascular response to skin incision. After skin incision, EEG alpha 2 power was significantly decreased in both groups. A significant increase of delta activity was only found in the saline group.

Meticulous investigation is mandatory whenever there is any suspicion of pseudo-occlusion, since it can easily be removed with endoarterectomy. Fifteen patients were selected in the last twelve years from those participating in a prospective study on the natural history of total occlusion of the internal carotid artery. The mean follow-up was 4.2 years (ranging from 1 to 12). Pseudo-occlusion was diagnosed by duplex examination in the presence of a continuous signal with filling in of the spectral waveform window and no pulsatile flow. Arteriography showed a segmental occlusion of the internal carotid artery with reconstitution of flow in the distal portion of the vessel. Operations were performed under general anesthesia with EEG monitoring. Intraluminal shunt was necessary in only one patient. Patch closure of the arteriotomy was performed in two patients. All patients were put on Ticlopidin ""sine die"" after the operation. No mortality or strokes occurred in the perioperative period. Two patients presented with ipsilateral TIA after 7 months and one year, respectively. We conclude that: the incidence of this disease is low; the performance of duplex scan in combination with arteriography is essential in order to obtain the diagnosis of pseudo-occlusion; a strong suspicion of carotid pseudo-occlusion should always spring to mind when an apparently occluded carotid artery continues to be symptomatic or when, in asymptomatic patients, there is some discordance between angiography and Doppler or duplex scan findings; pseudo-occlusion should be considered an indication for urgent operation only in selected symptomatic patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9257677/

These include haemodynamic, respiratory, muscular and autonomic signs. These measures do not indicate adequacy of anaesthesia in a reliable manner. Many attempts have been made to find a more accurate monitor. Direct monitoring of anaesthetic effect should be possible by EEG measurement. EEG information can be reduced, condensed and simplified, leading to single numbers (spectral edge frequency and median frequency). These methods appear insufficient for assessing anaesthetic adequacy. The bispectral index, derived from bispectral analysis of the EEG, is a very promising tool for measuring adequacy of anaesthesia. An alternative approach is to monitor evoked potentials. Middle latency auditory evoked potentials may be helpful in assessing anaesthetic adequacy. Both techniques need further validation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9202934/
9250944,Ketamine psychedelic therapy (KPT): a review of the results of ten years of research.,Journal of psychoactive drugs,1997,"Krupitsky EM, Grinenko AY","Ketamine is a prescription drug used for general anesthesia. In subanesthetic doses, it induces profound psychedelic experiences and hallucinations. The subanesthetic effect of ketamine was the hypothesized therapeutic mechanism in the authors' use of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy for alcoholism. The results of a controlled clinical trial demonstrated a considerable increase in efficacy of the authors' standard alcoholism treatment when supplemented by ketamine psychedelic therapy (KPT). Total abstinence for more than one year was observed in 73 out of 111 (65.8%) alcoholic patients in the KPT group, compared to 24% (24 out of 100 patients) of the conventional treatment control group (p < 0.01). The authors' studies of the underlying psychological mechanisms of KPT have indicated that ketamine-assisted psychedelic therapy of alcoholic patients induces a harmonization of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) personality profile, positive transformation of nonverbalized (mostly unconscious) self-concept and emotional attitudes to various aspects of self and other people, positive changes in life values and purposes, important insights into the meaning of life and an increase in the level of spiritual development. Most importantly, these psychological changes were shown to favor a sober lifestyle. The data from biochemical investigations showed that pharmacological action of KPT affects both monoaminergic and opioidergic neurotransmitter metabolism, i.e., those neurochemical systems which are involved in the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence. The data from EEG computer-assisted analysis demonstrated that ketamine increases theta activity in cerebrocortical regions of alcoholic patients. This is evidence of the reinforcement of limbic cortex interaction during KPT session.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9250944/

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rac-thiopentone have been extensively studied but the component R-(+)- and S-(-)- enantiomers, until very recently, have been largely ignored.
The present study analyses the pharmacokinetics of R-(+)- and S-(-)-thiopentone in 12 patients given rac-thiopentone intravenously for induction of anaesthesia and five patients given a prolonged infusion of rac-thiopentone used for treatment of intracranial hypertension.
The mean total body clearance (CLT) and apparent volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) showed trends towards higher values for R-(+)- than for S-(-)-thiopentone in both patient groups; CLT and Vss of unbound fractions of R-(+)- and S-(-)-thiopentone, however, did not show these trends. The time courses of R-(+)- and S-(-)- thiopentone serum concentrations were so similar that EEG effect could not be attributed to one or other enantiomer. Serum protein binding for S-(-)-thiopentone was greater than for R-(+)-thiopentone (P = 0.02) and 24 h urinary excretion of R-(+)-thiopentone was greater than for S-(-)-thiopentone (P = 0.03). In one patient, concomitant measurement of CSF and serum thiopentone concentrations found that serum: CSF equilibration of unbound fractions of both enantiomers was essentially complete.
The study was unable to determine any pharmacokinetic difference of clinical significance between the R-(+)- and S-(-)-thiopentone enantiomers and concludes that minor differences in CLT and Vss could be explained by enantioselective difference found in serum protein binding.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9146846/

To establish its utility for this purpose, it is important to determine the relation among BIS, measured drug concentration, and increasing levels of sedation. This study was designed to evaluate this relation for four commonly used anesthetic drugs: propofol, midazolam, isoflurane, and alfentanil.
Seventy-two consenting volunteers were studied at four institutions. Volunteers were given either isoflurane, propofol, midazolam, or alfentanil. Each volunteer was administered a dose-ranging sequence of one of the study drugs to achieve predetermined target concentrations. A frontal montage was used for continuous recording of the EEG. At each pseudo-steady-state drug concentration, a BIS score was recorded, the participant was shown either a picture or given a word to recall, an arterial blood sample was obtained for subsequent analysis of drug concentration, and the participant was evaluated for level of sedation as determined by the responsiveness portion of the observer's assessment of the alertness/ sedation scale (OAAS). An OAAS score of 2 or less was considered unconscious. The BIS (version 2.5) score was recorded in real-time and the BIS (version 3.0) was subsequently derived off-line from the recorded raw EEG data. The relation among BIS, measured drug concentration, responsiveness score, and presence or absence of recall was determined by linear and logistic regression for both the individual drugs and, when appropriate, for the pooled results. The prediction probability was also calculated.
The BIS score (r = 0.883) correlated significantly better than the measured propofol concentration (r = -0.778; P < 0.05) with the responsiveness score. The BIS provided as effective correlation with responsiveness score of the OAAS as did the measured concentration for midazolam and isoflurane. None of the volunteers given alfentanil lost consciousness and thus were excluded from the pooled analysis. The pooled BIS values at which 50% and 95% of participants were unconscious were 67 and 50, respectively. The prediction probability values for BIS ranged from 0.885-0.976, indicating a very high predictive performance for correctly indicating probability of loss of consciousness.
The BIS both correlated well with the level of responsiveness and provided an excellent prediction of the loss of consciousness. These results imply that BIS may be a valuable monitor of the level of sedation and loss of consciousness for propofol, midazolam, and isoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9105228/

This prospective multicenter study was designed to evaluate the real-time utility of BIS in predicting movement response to skin incision using a variety of general anesthetic techniques. Three hundred patients from seven study sites received an anesthetic regimen expected to give an approximately 50% movement response at skin incision. EEG was continuously recorded via an Aspect B-500 monitor and BIS was calculated in real time from bilateral frontocentral channels displayed on the monitor. Half of the patients were randomized to a treatment group in which anesthetic drug doses were increased to produce a lower BIS. In the control group, BIS was recorded, but no action taken on the data displayed. A determination of movement in response to skin incision was made in the 2 min succeeding incision. Retrospective pharmacodynamic modeling was performed using STANPUMP to estimate effect-site concentrations of intravenously administered anesthetics. BIS values were significantly higher in the control group (66 +/- 19) versus the BIS-guided group, in which additional anesthesia was administered to produce a lower BIS (51 +/- 19). The movement response rate was significantly higher in the control group at 43% compared with 13% in the BIS-guided group, but response rates were low at sites which used larger doses of opioids. Logistic regression analysis showed that BIS, estimated opioid effect-site concentrations, and heart rate (in that order) were the best predictors of movement at skin incision. This study demonstrates that dosing anesthetic drugs to lower BIS values achieves a lower probability of movement in response to surgical stimulation. BIS is a significant predictor of patient response to incision, but the utility of the BIS depends on the anesthetic technique being used. When drugs such as propofol or isoflurane are used as the primary anesthetic, changes in BIS correlate with the probability of response to skin incision. When opioid analgesics are used, the correlation to patient movement becomes much less significant, so that patients with apparently ""light"" EEG profiles may not move or otherwise respond to incision. Therefore, the adjunctive use of opioid analgesics confounds the use of BIS as a measure of anesthetic adequacy when movement response to skin incision is used as the primary end point.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9085977/

After induction with desflurane, patients' lungs were ventilated to maintain three different end-expiratory concentrations of desflurane (1.5, 3 and 6%) during four consecutive 10-min periods before surgery. As the end-expiratory concentration of desflurane was increased, Pa and Nb (AER) amplitudes decreased and their latencies increased, and spontaneous EEG showed an increase in amplitude and a slowing of frequency. A linear relationship was demonstrated between log10 concentration of desflurane and all variables (P = 0.001). Pa amplitude showed the greatest linearity followed by the derived variable F95 of the EEG. From regression slopes, mean percentage changes of each variable were calculated for a 1 MAC change in desflurane concentration, Pa amplitude showed the largest change (mean 49% (95% confidence interval 40-56%) decrease for a 1 MAC increase). This was greater than that of F95 for a similar confidence interval, indicating better resolution. This study confirms that the early cortical AER is affected by desflurane in a similar manner to that of other anaesthetic agents and as such remains the most promising EEG derived measure of depth of anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9135306/
9089792,The gamma-hydroxybutyrate signalling system in brain: organization and functional implications.,Progress in neurobiology,1997,Maitre M,"gamma-Hydroxybutyrate is a metabolite of GABA which is synthesized and accumulated by neurons in brain. This substance is present in micromolar quantities in all brain regions investigated as well as in several peripheral organs. Neuronal depolarization releases gamma-hydroxybutyrate into the extracellular space in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate high-affinity receptors are present only in neurons, with a restricted specific distribution in the hippocampus, cortex and dopaminergic structures of rat brain (the striatum in general, olfactory bulbs and tubercles, frontal cortex, dopaminergic nuclei A9, A10 and A12). Stimulation of these receptors with low amounts of gamma-hydroxybutyrate induces in general hyperpolarizations in dopaminergic structures with a reduction of dopamine release. However, in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex, it seems that gamma-hydroxybutyrate induces depolarization with an accumulation of cGMP and an increase in inositol phosphate turnover. Some of the electrophysiological effects of GHB are blocked by NCS-382, a gamma-hydroxybutyrate receptor antagonist while some others are strongly attenuated by GABAB receptors antagonists. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate penetrates freely into the brain when administered intravenously or intraperitoneally. This is a unique situation for a molecule with signalling properties in the brain. Thus, the gamma-hydroxybutyrate concentration in brain easily can be increased more than 100 times. Under these conditions, gamma-hydroxybutyrate receptors are saturated and probably desensitized and down-regulated. It is unlikely that GABAB receptors could be stimulated directly by GHB. Most probably, GABA is released in part under the control of GHB receptors in specific pathways expressing GABAB receptors. Alternatively, GABAB receptors might be specifically stimulated by the GABA formed via the metabolism of gamma-hydroxybutyrate in brain. In animals and man, these GHBergic and GABAergic potentiations induce dopaminergic hyperactivity (which follows the first phase of dopaminergic terminal hyperpolarization), a strong sedation with anaesthesia and some EEG changes with epileptic spikes. It is presumed that, under pathological conditions (hepatic failure, alcoholic intoxication, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase defects), the rate of GHB synthesis or degradation in the peripheral organ is modified and induces increased GHB levels which could interfere with the normal brain mechanisms. This pathological status could benefit from treatments with gamma-hydroxybutyric and/or GABAB receptors antagonists. Nevertheless, the regulating properties of the endogenous gamma-hydroxybutyrate system on the dopaminergic pathways are a cause for the recent interest in synthetic ligands acting specifically at gamma-hydroxybutyrate receptors and devoid of any role as metabolic precursor of GABA in brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9089792/

Patients were divided into two groups for anesthetic induction. The first group (control) was divided into two subgroups, with the first subgroup receiving ""low-dose"" etomidate (LET) 0.4 to 0.6 mg/kg titrated to an electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral edge frequency (SEF) of 10 to 12 Hz.

Baseline (awake) measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP) heart rate (HR), and SEF were obtained prior to anesthetic induction that was accomplished using a small bolus plus an infusion of the induction drug titrated to the EEG target. MAP, HR, and SEF were recorded just prior to laryngoscopy and intubation (T1), 30 seconds after laryngoscopy and intubation (T2), and 90 seconds after (T3) laryngoscopy and intubation.

We used the UNIFAC-EEG technique to differentiate oscillatory systems underlying the rhythms induced by these drugs in a quantitative fashion. While thiopental induced beta-rhythms which were similar to those appearing during drowsiness, midazolam and propofol induced beta-rhythms with substantially different characteristics. The differences between the beta-rhythms induced by drug infusion and previously described 'sleep spindles' are discussed. We conclude that a quantitative analysis of beta-rhythms can differentiate the effects of these drugs on the EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9246224/

There were 227 carotid endarterectomies and patch graft angioplasty (198 patients), 79 carotid eversion endarterectomies (70 patients) and 58 internal carotid artery reimplantations into the common carotid artery (48 patients). Indications for CARs were TIAs (141, 43.9%), amaurosis fugax (60, 18.6%) and fixed or partial nonprogressing stroke (14, 4.3%). One hundred and six patients (33.1%) were asymptomatic. EEG abnormalities consistent with cerebral ischemia occurred in 97 (26.3%) operations. The indwelling shunt (IS) was used in 73 cases; in the remaining 24 (24.7%), IS was not used on purpose because the surgical procedure was carried out successfully within 5-6 min after the appearance of EEG changes. All patients awoke from the anesthesia without any neurological deficit. Five patients presented with a major stroke within postoperative day 1 and 2, and 1 patient died on postoperative day 10. In 2 of these cases, the intraoperative EEG monitoring was absolutely normal and the IS was not used: the carotid occlusion was due to technical errors. The most striking finding of this series is the absence of false-negative results in continuous EEG monitoring. EEG monitoring appears an available and useful method for the detection of cerebral ischemia secondary to carotid cross-clamping and contributes to put at zero the intraoperative complications of the surgical procedure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9018032/
9009936,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of remifentanil. II. Model application.,Anesthesiology,1997,"Minto CF, Schnider TW, Shafer SL","The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of remifentanil were studied in 65 healthy volunteers using the electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure the opioid effect. In a companion article, the authors developed complex population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models that incorporated age and lean body mass (LBM) as significant covariates and characterized intersubject pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability. In the present article, the authors determined whether remifentanil dosing should be adjusted according to age and LBM, or whether these covariate effects were overshadowed by the interindividual variability present in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Based on the typical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, nomograms for bolus dose and infusion rates at each age and LBM were derived. Three populations of 500 individuals each, ages 20, 50, and 80 yr, were simulated base on the interindividual variances in model parameters as estimated by the NONMEM software package. The peak EEG effect in response to a bolus, the steady-state EEG effect in response to an infusion, and the time course of drug effect were examined in each of the three populations. Simulations were performed to examine the time necessary to achieve a 20%, 50%, and 80% decrease in remifentanil effect site concentration after a variable-length infusion. The variability in the time for a 50% decrease in effect site concentrations was examined in each of the three simulated populations. Titratability using a constant-rate infusion was also examined.
After a bolus dose, the age-related changes in V1 and Ke0 nearly offset each other. The peak effect site concentration reached after a bolus dose does not depend on age. However, the peak effect site concentration occurs later in elderly individuals. Because the EEG shows increased brain sensitivity to opioids with increasing age, an 80-yr old person required approximately one half the bolus dose of a 20-yr old of similar LBM to reach the same peak EEG effect. Failure to adjust the bolus dose for age resulted in a more rapid onset of EEG effect and prolonged duration of EEG effect in the simulated elderly population. The infusion rate required to maintain 50% EEG effect in a typical 80-yr old is approximately one third that required in a typical 20-yr old. Failure to adjust the infusion rate for age resulted in a more rapid onset of EEG effect and more profound steady-state EEG effect in the simulated elderly population. The typical times required for remifentanil effect site concentrations to decrease by 20%, 50%, and 80% after prolonged administration are rapid and little affected by age or duration of infusion. These simulations suggest that the time required for a decrease in effect site concentrations will be more variable in the elderly. As a result, elderly patients may occasionally have a slower emergence from anesthesia than expected. A step change in the remifentanil infusion rate resulted in a rapid and predictable change of EEG effect in both the young and the elderly.
Based on the EEG model, age and LBM are significant demographic factors that must be considered when determining a dosage regimen for remifentanil. This remains true even when interindividual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability are incorporated in the analysis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9009936/
8989022,Electroencephalographic bispectral index correlates with intraoperative recall and depth of propofol-induced sedation.,Anesthesia and analgesia,1997,"Liu J, Singh H, White PF","The bispectral (BIS) index and 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF) of the electroencephalograph (EEG) have been used to study the anesthetic and sedative effects of intravenously (i.v.) administered drugs. This prospective study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the BIS index and 95% SEF for assessing the level of propofol-induced sedation and amnesia during regional anesthesia. Ten consenting adult patients undergoing surgery with regional anesthesia were administered propofol in increments of 10-20 mg i.v., every 5-10 min until they became unresponsive to tactile stimulation (i.e., mild prodding or shaking). The BIS index and 95% SEF were continuously recorded from a bifrontal montage (Fp1-Cz and Fp2-Cz) using the Aspect B500 monitor. The depth of sedation was assessed clinically at 5- to 10-min intervals using the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale, with 1 = no response to tactile stimulation to 5 = wide awake. Each patient was shown a picture of an animal (cat) prior to administration of an initial dose of propofol, 40 mg i.v.. Subsequently, patients were administered intermittent bolus doses of propofol, 10-20 mg i.v., and shown different pictures upon achieving OAA/S scores of 4, 3, and 2 during the onset of and recovery from propofol-induced sedation. Picture recall was tested upon arrival of the patient in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Of the two EEG variables studied, the BIS index exhibited a better correlation with the OAA/S scores during both the onset (Spearman's rho = 0.744) and recovery (Spearman's rho = 0.705) phases of propofol-induced sedation. With the increasing depth of sedation, there was a progressive decrease in the BIS index (OAA/S score of 5, BIS = 94.5 +/- 2.9; 4, 93.3 +/- 3.3; 3, 89 +/- 6.1; 2, 80.1 +/- 8.7; 1, 75.6 +/- 7.5; mean +/- SD). Conversely, there was a progressive increase in the BIS value during recovery from propofol sedation (OAA/S score of 1, BIS = 75.6 +/- 7.5; 2, 82.4 +/- 10.5; 3, 84.9 +/- 5.9; 4, 93.8 +/- 0.8). Although the changes in the 95% SEF values were less consistent during the onset phase, this EEG variable increased from 16.4 +/- 5.0 to 19.3 +/- 5.6 as the OAA/S score increased from 1 to 4 during the recovery phase. Patient recall of the intraoperative pictures decreased with increasing depth of sedation and decreasing BIS values (OAA/S:% BIS:% recall = 5:94.5 +/- 2.9:100%; 4:93.4 +/- 3:63%; 3:87.3 +/- 6.1:40%; 2:80.8 +/- 8.3:0%; 1:75.6 +/- 7.5:0%).

Thirty-four patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) participated in this randomized double-blind study. Patients in Group L (n = 17) received 3 micrograms.kg-1 sufentanil and those in Group H (n = 17) 15 micrograms.kg-1. Premedication was 60 micrograms.kg-1 lorazepam po. Anaesthesia and neuromuscular blockade were induced by infusing sufentanil and 0.15 mg.kg-1 vecuronium i.v. over five minutes. Haemodynamic data and the electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral edge were acquired by computer and compared at Control, Induction and Intubation.
Sufentanil dose did not affect the haemodynamic or EEG response at end-induction. No bradyarrhythmias occurred, and the incidence of hypotension was 12% in both groups. However, during induction apparent electromyographic artifacts and a transiently greater increase in heart rate were observed in Group H. The serum sufentanil concentration at Induction was 6.1 +/- 1.8 ng.ml-1 in Group L and 25.4 +/- 8.8 ng.ml-1 in Group H, and did not correlate with haemodynamic changes. No patient recalled any intraoperative event.
Increasing sufentanil dose from 3 to 15 micrograms-1 does not influence the ultimate haemodynamic response to induction. Combined with lorazepam premedication, 3 micrograms-1 sufentanil produces near-maximal haemodynamic and EEG effects and is adequate for induction and tracheal intubation of patients undergoing CABG. Sufentanil 15 micrograms.kg-1 is no more efficacious, and causes transient cardiovascular stimulation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8988819/

Thirty-four women (ASA-1) were studied after the epidural administration of either 10 ml saline (group A, n = 8), 10 ml saline with 0.4 mg BPN (group B, n = 13), or 10 ml saline with 150 micrograms CLO (group C, n = 13). The MAC of halothane was reduced by 32% in group B (p < 0.05), and by 23% in group C (p < 0.05) compared with group A. The delta activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG) was more dominant in groups B and C 20 and 30 minutes after the administration of BPN and CLO compared with group A. The alpha activity in group A was significantly greater than that in the other groups. The delta activity in groups B and C was increased significantly compared with group A. The blood pressure was significantly lower after the epidural administered of CLO in group C, compared with groups A and B. The study concluded that epidurally administered CLO significantly reduce the MAC of halothane and also resulted in significant acceleration of delta activity on the EEG, as did BPN. The mechanisms by which the central nervous system (CNS) is depressed by epidural BPN and CLO are different, but this may have resulted from their direct action on the CNS via the systemic and spinal absorption of BPN and CLO.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9023451/

Transient facial palsies have been observed after SE insertion. Their frequency of occurrence, distribution, and duration have not been well characterized, however. We hypothesized that this complication is due to the effect of local anesthesia on the peripheral branches of the seventh cranial nerve. To test this hypothesis, we compared the incidence and characteristics of facial palsy during SE insertions performed with either local anesthesia or after intravenous fentanyl administration.
We performed a retrospective study in two patient groups. Group A consisted of 25 patients aged 28 +/- 8.2 years who underwent a prolonged video-EEG (VEEG) monitoring study with SE after subcutaneous infusion of 1% lidocaine in the insertion area. Group B included 25 patients aged 30.1 +/- 8.9 years whose SE were inserted after intravenous administration of 100-200 micrograms fentanyl. Blood pressure (BP) was monitored every 3-5 min throughout the procedure.
Five patients (20%) from group A had a transient facial palsy; in 4, it was complete and in 1 it was partial; 1 patient had a bilateral facial palsy. Paresis lasted 1-7 min (mean 3.2 min). In all patients, the recovery was complete. None of the patients in group B had complications (p = 0.025, Fisher's exact test).
Transient facial palsy is a relatively frequent complication of SE insertion when SE are placed under local anesthesia; patients should be forewarned of its possible occurrence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8956858/

Our aim was to study the relationship between mMCAvs and clamping ischaemia during carotid endarterectomy in awake patients.
In a consecutive series of 57 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under locoregional anaesthesia 51 were monitored by intraoperative TCD, continuous EEG, and neurologic awake testing.
Five of the 51 (9.8%) patients had transient clamping ischaemia, which carotid shunting reversed. TCD showed that these five patients had significant lower mean mMCAvs than the other 46 patients, who had no deficits (1.8 +/- 1.1 cm/s vs. 26.2 +/- 8.5, p = 0.0003). Current TCD criteria indicated that four other patients (7.8%) should have been shunted. All four had significantly higher clamping mMCAvs than the five shunted patients (11.5 +/- 1.9 vs. 1.8 +/- 1.1, p = 0.0012).
Intraoperative TCD detected cerebral ischaemia and yielded no false-negative.

Forty-one patients undergoing cardiac surgery were anaesthetized with propofol and alfentanil. During several periods of surgery we recorded LLAEP. Peak-to-peak amplitude measures were used to determine if a particular LLAEP recording trace contained a recognizable waveform. Both before and after each LLAEP recording epoch, MLAEP and the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. Peak latencies and amplitudes of brainstem peak V and midlatency peaks Na, Pa, Nb, Pb and Nc, characteristic frequencies from the spontaneous EEG, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and nasopharyngeal temperature (7) were compared between recording epochs with and without clear LLAEP waveforms. These variables were also used in a discriminant analysis to predict the occurrence of an LLAEP waveform. Pa and Nb latencies were significantly shorter both before and after recording epochs in which an LLAEP waveform occurred, compared with epochs in which no LLAEP waveform occurred. Using a combination of up to six EEG, MLAEP, MAP and T measures, it was possible to predict the occurrence or absence of an LLAEP waveform with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 86%. We conclude that MLAEP components provide information on the possibility of perceptual processing during general anaesthesia, and thus may be relevant for monitoring depth of anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8957978/

Four healthy volunteers completed the protocol.
Subjects received midazolam 0.1-0.2 mg/kg by intravenous bolus on 3 study days, separated by a minimum washout period of 1 week. Subjects participated in an initial open-label response phase followed by a randomized, crossover trial of each benzodiazepine antagonist.
Venous blood samples were obtained to characterize the pharmacokinetics of all study compounds. The EEG parameter of total number of waves/second (recorded from FP1-F3 and FP2-F4 electrodes) in the frequency of 12-30 Hz was used to quantify effect. Flumazenil appeared to prolong the elimination half-life of midazolam significantly (p < 0.05). Theophylline (aminophylline) also appeared to prolong the half-life of flumazenil (p < 0.05). Despite considerable variability, flumazenil resulted in reversal of sedation at concentrations achieved by routine dosing. Resedation was apparent for all subjects following flumazenil reversal. Only partial reversal of sedation by theophylline was achieved by an aminophylline dose of 1-2 mg/kg.
Flumazenil was consistently effective in reversing sedation by midazolam at routinely recommended dosing. Further investigation of aminophylline as a reversal agent should use an estimated dose of 6-8 mg/kg aminophylline.

All LNTLE patients showed (a) presence of temporal neocortical lesion or lateral seizure onset by intracranial recording, and (b) absence of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) by histopathologic analysis. All patients with MBTLE showed (a) video-scalp EEG seizures consistent with mesial TLE, and (b) presence of unilateral MTS by histopathologic analysis. All patients had good surgical outcomes (Engel I or II). Unilateral IAP memory performance was defined as percentage of memory items presented during hemispheric anesthesia that was recognized after recovery. IAP asymmetry scores were the differences in memory performance after right and left injections.
Mean memory-asymmetry scores were significantly lower in the LNTLE than in the MBTLE group. An IAP memory asymmetry of < 25% correctly classified seven of 10 patients with LNTLE, and an asymmetry of > or = 25% correctly classified 18 of 22 patients with MBTLE. Age at first risk for epilepsy was significantly younger in those with MBTLE than in those with nonlesional LNTLE.

Graphical analysis was carried out by autocorrelation functions and return maps with different lags. During moderate and deep anaesthesia, the electroencephalogram (EEG) shows a burst suppression pattern, consisting of abruptly-occurring high amplitude bursts alternating with periods of relative silence. Deep anaesthesia with burst suppression pattern provides a simple model of brain activity when the noise that is usually present in a subject who is awake is suppressed. During anaesthesia-induced EEG suppression, the brain reacts to different external stimuli with bursts. In respect to sensory processing during anaesthesia, it is interesting to know whether these bursts have different dynamics depending on the stimuli used. We have used graphical analysis to reveal the possible differences in bursts evoked by different stimuli. Externally evoked bursts were induced by auditory, electric and visual stimuli. The EEG studied in this paper consists of 25 bursts from one subject. We have estimated the autocorrelation function for each burst and used the formation gained from such autocorrelation coefficients as the grounds for determining different lags for return maps. The graphical methods used revealed differences in dynamics and topology of bursts as evoked by different stimuli. Spontaneous bursts clearly had different dynamics from evoked burst; which could not be seen directly from the raw EEG data. This study suggests that graphical analysis is a useful tool to obtain information about the dynamics of neuronal processes behind cortical responses during deep anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8968839/

The techniques were: (1) median frequency, (2) spectral edge frequency, (3) the cerebral function analysing monitor (CFAM1) and (4) a depth of anaesthesia monitor based on EEG pattern recognition (ADAM). Dose-response curves are presented for stepwise increases in stable end-tidal concentrations of each agent.

One such measure, the largest Lyapunov exponent (lambda 1), appears to have potential for identifying seizure activity and for being of clinical utility for characterizing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) seizures. As a result, we compared lambda 1 for the EEG recorded in 8 depressed subjects in 3 states: (1) during right unilateral ECT seizures, (2) during the pre-ECT waking state, and (3) following anesthesia administration but prior to ECT. Spectral amplitude and autocorrelation were also calculated in these states, allowing a comparison of these measures with lambda 1. We hypothesized that lambda 1 would be lowest during the ECT seizures, suggestive of greater EEG signal predictability over time during the seizures. We found that during the seizures lambda 1 was smaller, while spectral amplitude was larger. Significant inter-state differences were not found for the left temporal and occipital regions suggesting that these measures might serve as markers of the degree of seizure involvement of specific brain regions. Spectral amplitude and lambda 1 were uncorrelated and varied independently in some cases. The autocorrelation time was shortest in the waking EEG, and longest for the post-anesthesia EEG, and did not account for the differences seen in lambda 1. In contrast, the persistence of oscillations in the autocorrelation functions was greater for the ictal EEG than the other two states and may relate to lambda 1.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8761049/

Prospective clinical investigation. In addition, the influence of circulatory parameters on SEP curves will also be tested.
Department of Surgery of a university clinic.
A total of 200 patients underwent intraoperative monitoring by means of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) during carotid endarterectomy between March 1, 1991 and August 1, 1994.
In order to exclude blood pressure variations as a cause for amplitude changes the blood pressure and pulse were documented during the entire phase of preparation and clamping.
A significant correlation could not be established between parameters of circulation and amplitude changes (r = 0.0026; p = 0.62). In seven cases of intraoperative amplitude reduction of more than 50% a stroke has been avoided by inserting a shunt. Despite the lack of an amplitude reduction, a watershed stroke of A.cerebri media and A.cerebri posterior occurred in two instances. Taking this into consideration the sensitivity of monitoring is 99.0% at a specificity of 100%.
SEP-monitoring in carotid endarterectomy is simple to execute and is superior in sensitivity to EEG analysis. To avoid artefaction by anesthesia, a standard injection anesthesia is recommended.

During EEG suppression, they were given somatosensory stimulation, consisting of 3-s episodes of 60 electric pulses (20 mA, 0.2 ms), to the tips of the left and right fifth fingers alternately for 10 min. One finger was then anesthetized at the base of the proximal phalanx with prilocaine and the other finger was injected with saline in a double-blind manner. The stimulation was continued for 20 min. In nine patients, the disappearance of bursts in response to stimuli applied to the anesthetized finger clearly indicated the side of the conduction block. After the injection of local anesthetic, there was a predominance of offset bursts over onset bursts in response to stimuli applied to the anesthetized finger (P < 0.05) before the responses disappeared.

Basic FGF augmented the tone of the isolated non-pregnant uterus at the concentrations of 10(-5) g/ml and above and inhibited or tended to inhibit the contractile tension of non-pregnant or pregnant uterus at 10(-4) g/ml, but it did not influence the spontaneous movement of the uterus, either the non-pregnant or pregnant, under in situ conditions even at a dose of 1 mg/kg (i.v.). Basic FGF did not influence the pupil size. 4. Respiratory and circulatory systems: Basic FGF had no effect on the isolated heart. The influence was not exerted on the heart rate for the isolated atria but slight inhibition of contractile force was observed at 10(-4) g/ml. In anesthetized dogs a decrease in blood pressure, a slight increase in heart rate and respiratory rate and a decrease in femoral blood flow were observed at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.) of bFGF Similarly, a slight increase in heart rate and a slight decrease of blood pressure were observed at 1 mg/kg (s.c.) in conscious rats. 5. Digestive system: Administration of bFGF at 1 mg/kg did not result in changes in the transport capacity within the gastrointestinal tract (s.c., i.v.) and the secretion of the gastric juice (s.c.). 6. Urine output and electrolyte metabolism: Basic FGF produced a decrease in urinary Na+ excretion at 1 mg/kg (s.c.), and showed a tendency to increase in urinary volume at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.). At 1 mg/kg (i.v.) urinary excretion of Na+ and Cl- was decreased significantly. It had no effect on the ability of rats to excrete PSP (phenol red) up to 1 mg/kg (s.c.). 7. Blood system: Basic FGF did not influence the coagulation time of the whole blood, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time of rats up to 1 mg/kg (s.c., i.v.). It did not influence the aggregation of rabbit platelets induced by collagen and ADP up to 10(-4) g/ml. Basic FGF at concentration of 10(-4) g/ml exhibited no hemolytic action. 8. Local action: Plantar subcutaneous injection of bFGF at above 0.005 mg/site induced edema by itself on and after the next day, and also reinforced carrageenin-induced edema from 1 day after injection. The results show that bFGF did not produce any acute effects on the somatic nervous system, autonomic nervous system, smooth muscle and blood system. In contrast, bFGF produced slight effects on the circulatory system, central nervous system and kidney function when injected systemically.

Ten healthy men (mean age, 33.9 years) participated in two experimental sessions in a randomized cross-over, double-blind study: in one session subjects were given a placebo and in the other they were given 0.125 mg triazolam (TRZ). Each experimental session was conducted on 1 day. After a pre-drug EEG recording and an event-related potential (ERP) recording, under an oddball paradigm, subjects took the TRZ or placebo orally at 1000 hours. Thereafter, EEG and ERP recording sessions, following the same procedure as the pre-drug sessions, were conducted at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after drug administration. The EEG and ERP recordings from Cz and Pz referred to the bilaterally linked ear electrodes were used. We found that P300 latency was significantly prolonged in TRZ condition at 2 h (Pz) and 4 h (Cz and Pz) after TRZ, and that the P300 amplitude was significantly reduced at 2 h (Cz and Pz) and 4 h (Pz) after TRZ, compared to the same times after placebo. The absolute power values for the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha 1 (8-9 Hz), and alpha 2 (10-12 Hz) bands did not differ at any measurement time between the treatments. Only the beta band (13-19 Hz) power value was significantly elevated after the TRZ administration (versus placebo). No significant sedative effects were detected in subjective measurements. These results indicate that a single oral dose of 0.125 mg TRZ caused cortical changes without distinct general sedation or subjective sleepiness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8783393/

The AEP and EEG were recorded before incision, between incision and sternotomy, and after sternotomy. Peak latencies and amplitudes of AEP peaks V, Na, Pa, Nb, Pb and Nc were determined. From the EEG the median, spectral edge and peak power frequencies, and percentages of delta, theta, alpha and beta power were calculated. Each patient was classified as responsive, equivocally responsive or unresponsive to incision or sternotomy based on increase in arterial pressure and heart rate on incision and sternotomy. Before incision, Nb and Pb latency and propofol concentration were higher for unresponsive patients but heart rate and median frequency before incision were lower. After sternotomy, Pa and Nb amplitude, peak power frequency and percentage alpha power were higher, and percentage theta power lower for responsive patients. Pa latency was higher after sternotomy for unresponsive patients. Using a combination of heart rate, arterial pressures and features derived from the AEP (all recorded before incision), the occurrence of a response to incision could be predicted in individual patients with a sensitivity of 85%, positive predictive accuracy of 63% and total accuracy of 72%. We conclude that AEP are more sensitive to pain stimuli than spectral features of the spontaneous EEG. In addition, the AEP may help in predicting inadequate anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8688270/

With an average Cmax of cetirizine of 697.0 ng/ml (10 mg) and 1000.2 ng/ml (20 mg), the diameter of histamine-induced skin weals was reduced by 24.0-74.9% depending on histamine concentration and with no dose dependence for cetirizine. Placebo and chlorpheniramine were ineffective. Behavioral or neuropsychological signs of sedation were never observed. An increase of the 6.5-14.5 Hz EEG power, with anterior scalp preponderance, was observed after chlorpheniramine or cetirizine 20 mg. This effect of cetirizine was accounted for by a substantial increase of power in the 6.5-8.0 Hz frequency subsegment and is regarded, for these experimental conditions, as an established early EEG indication of mild sedation (vigilance 'state A'). No EEG effects were observed after placebo or cetirizine at the 10 mg dose. The existence of some histaminergic (H1) specificity of the mechanisms modulating vigilance and of a threshold dose of cetirizine for sedative action is suggested.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8741162/

Reassuring electroencephalographic (EEG) findings during defibrillation threshold testing at defibrillator implantation.,Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology,1996,"Vriens EM, Bakker PF, Vries JW, Wieneke GH, Van Huffelen AC","The impact of circulatory arrest on EEG features during defibrillation threshold testing for implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator has been disputed. Cumulation of cerebral ischemic effects during threshold testing has been observed, and consequently the advice was given to avoid short intervals between tests and to limit the test number. This study investigated the duration of EEG signs of cerebral ischemia as well as the occurrence of cumulation. EEGs were recorded during standardized general anesthesia. Subsequent tests were performed after recovery of EEG, electrocardiogram, systemic arterial blood pressure, and heart rate. In 36 consecutive survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 286 episodes of induced circulatory arrest were analyzed. Ischemic EEG changes were present in all episodes of circulatory arrest, consisting of slowing, progressing to absence of activity. The relation between the onset time or recovery time and the test number and test interval was studied. A highly significant correlation between circulatory arrest and recovery time was found (P < 0.001). A significant negative correlation existed between test number and recovery time (P < 0.05). Test interval was not related with either onset or recovery time. We conclude that repeated threshold tests which are monitored by assessment of EEG and hemodynamics are not associated with cumulative EEG changes as a result of ischemia. Our results do not support the advice that the number of tests should be limited.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8641146/

While using 5 different combinations of isoflurane, 70% N2O, and fentanyl, we measured the EEG of 246 patients during pelvic laparoscopy and observed their movement responses to opening stimuli (defined as skin incision, CO2 needle insertion, or trocar insertion) and also to closing stimuli (defined as sutures during incision closure). The EEG was expressed as F95, the frequency in hertz below which resides 95% of the power in the EEG frequency spectrum. The relations between F95 and movement response were expressed as logistic regression curves. F95-response logistic regression curves, which are analogous to dose-response curves, were calculated for each of the 2 stimuli administered during each of the 5 anesthetic techniques. The prediction of patient responsiveness by F95 was tested using beta (beta), a measure of the slope of an F95-response logistic curve. The presence of shifts among the F95-response logistic curves was tested using the differences in F95 values between curves. Hypothesis tests used a level of significance of P = 0.05.
The slopes of the F95-response logistic regression curves showed a statistically significant ability to predict movement response to stimuli for 9 of the 10 combinations of stimuli and anesthetic techniques. We did not calculate an F95-response logistic curve for the tenth combination because it contained burst suppression, which our EEG analysis method was not designed to process. The F95-response logistic curves were shifted relative to each other, and the shifts were affected by the type of stimulus and the combination of anesthetic agents. Referenced to opening curves, the mean shift of the closing curves was +4.2 +/- 0.3 Hz (mean +/- SD). With increasing doses of fentanyl, the use of 70% N2O, or both, the curves shifted to higher values of F95; the range in shifts was 0.2 to 8.1 Hz. The slope beta values of the F95-response logistic curves and the shifts among the curves were similar to the beta values and shifts that might be expected from changes in anesthetic agent doses.
The EEG, expressed as F95, predicted movement response to surgical stimuli during combinations of isoflurane, 70% N2O, and fentanyl. The F95-response curves shifted upward on the frequency scale for the less intense stimuli and for anesthetic techniques using 70% N2O, fentanyl, or both. F95 prediction of movement response appeared to be related to anesthetic agent doses. Our F95-response curves may provide helpful guidelines for using F95 to titrate the administration of anesthetic agents and for assessing the depth of general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8823633/

After stable anaesthesia had been achieved with 1.0 MAC of isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen, patients were allocated randomly to receive two separate doses of vecuronium 0.05 mg kg-1 or saline. The AER was recorded before and after each dose and then after 20-s laryngoscopy in each group to determine any changes in the early cortical components of the AER waveform (Pa and Nb). There were no statistically significant changes between the vecuronium and saline groups. However, there was a statistically significant increase in mean Pa amplitude of 36% (P = 0.008) and a reduction in mean Nb latency of 6% (P = 0.05) after laryngoscopy in both the paralysed and unparalysed groups, and these changes did not differ significantly between groups. There were correspondingly significant haemodynamic responses to laryngoscopy in both groups.

With each, the first produced intense electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure activity with a sharp endpoint but no motoric activity and little heart rate elevation. The second produced 15-21 s of tonic-clonic activity with negligible seizure activity on the EEG monitor and little heart rate increase. The third produced typical motoric, EEG, and heart rate signs of seizure. These observations indicate that the signs of high EEG amplitude, sharp EEG endpoint, distinct postictal suppression, and tonic-clonic activity can appear in seizures of questionable quality and weak generalization through the brain. Consequently, none of these characteristics by themselves indicate good quality or seizure generalization, and ECT monitoring is incomplete without considering all of them along with peak heart rate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8777649/

C-EEG monitoring revealed that triprolidine-D produced significantly more daytime sedation and drowsiness than either astemizole-D or placebo (p < 0.05). Intermittent performance testing did not reveal consistent psychomotor deficits. There were no differences from placebo; the only significant findings showed that astemizole-D improved tracking accuracy at T + 65 h (p < 0.05) compared to baseline. Also, when scores were summed across all time points, astemizole-D improved scores significantly in contrast to triprolidine-D for the total scores (p < 0.05).

All these parameters failed to consistently describe the EEG effect of midazolam in a study in which large doses of midazolam were infused, and the effect subsequently reversed with flumazenil. Using a technique called semilinear correlation it is possible to extract a parameter from the EEG that is statistically optimally correlated with the apparent concentration of the benzodiazepine in the effect site. This method has been used to develop new univariate measures of the effects of opioids on the EEG but has not previously been applied to the EEG effects of benzodiazepines.
Data from ten subjects who received an infusion of midazolam were analyzed. The data were divided into ""learning"" and ""test"" sets. The learning set consisted of ten studies in which the volunteers received an infusion of 2.5 mg.min(-1) midazolam. Semilinear canonical correlation was used to extract an univariate descriptor of the EEG effect by weighting the different frequency bands of the EEG power spectrum. The test set comprised the same subjects on subsequent visits, in which the subjects received a continuous infusion of midazolam to maintain 20% or 80% of the peak drug effect for 3h. Twenty minutes after start of the midazolam infusion, the patient received an infusion of flumazenil to acutely reverse the benzodiazepine drug effect. The weights obtained from the learning set were tested prospectively in the test set, based on the coefficient of multiple determination, R(2), obtained by fitting the EEG effect to a sigmoid Emax model.
The canonical univariate parameter of benzodiazepine drug effect on the EEG, when applied to the test set receiving the midazolam infusion with flumazenil reversal, yielded a median R(2) of 0.78. The median R(2) of six commonly used empirical EEG measures of drug effect ranged from 0.18 to 0.55.

34 ASA status I and II patients scheduled for elective abdominal hysterectomy or mastectomy.
12 patients were studied without surgery (Group I, control). 22 patients were studied for the first 14 minutes following skin incision during hysterectomy (Group 2, n = 11) or mastectomy (Group 3, n = 11).
Anesthesia was maintained with 0.6% isoflurane in 66% N2O in oxygen (O2). EEG was recorded via 17 channels followed by calculation of spectral power densities in selected frequency bands for each recording site. In addition, heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), end-tidal carbon dioxide tensions, and isoflurane concentration were recorded. Total observation time was 20 minutes in all groups. At baseline, EEG variables were comparable in all groups. The EEG demonstrated slow wave activity superimposed with alpha waves. Start of surgery resulted in increases of slower waves and decreases in alpha activity. In both surgical groups, these EEG changes were most pronounced at frontal recording sites (p < 0.05) with differences in the frequency content. In Group 2 (hysterectomy), delta-activity became dominant, whereas in Group 3 (mastectomy), a shift to theta waves was observed. During surgery MAP was increased by 40% (Group 2; p < 0.05) and 21% (Group 3; p < 0.05), respectively.
These results show that specific surgical procedures may induce EEG slow wave activity to a different degree. The EEG response varied in relation to the surgical procedure and/or the intensity of noxious stimulation. Mastectomy resulted in the appearance of theta activity whereas, during laparotomy, the EEG frequency content was shifted to delta waves. The topographical analysis indicates spatial inhomogeneities in the EEG responses with a dominance at frontal areas. From this findings, it may be concluded that the electrode montage used for intraoperative EEG recordings has to be carefully selected.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8695077/

Cerebellopontine angle (CPA) surgery bears the risk of damaging the facial nerve in its root exit zone; functional degradation should therefore be reflected by changes of the nasal muscle F-wave. Constant current pulses supraliminal for direct (M) muscular responses were applied subcutaneously to the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve ipsilateral to the operated side, EEG needle electrodes were placed in the nasal muscle and referred to glabella for recording of myoelectric activity. Anesthesia was achieved by application of fentanyl, midazolame and N2O and low doses of short acting muscular relaxants; the above-mentioned narcotics did not influence F-wave recordings, whereas the administration of muscle relax ants was often deleterious to F-wave monitoring. 22 patients with different tumors in the CPA, the cerebellum or the vicinity of the brainstem were subject to this monitoring procedure up to now. F-wave monitoring was effective in 12/22 cases. In 7/12 patients the signal was stable without any resulting dysfunction postoperatively. In 3/12 cases changes in amplitude and/or latency were observed indicating a subsequent facial palsy of a moderate degree. In 2 cases the F-wave was lost-these suffered from a facial paralysis afterwards. As an illustrative case the course of one of these is pointed out. In 10/22 procedures F-wave monitoring was ineffective due to the prolonged administration of muscle relaxants. The F-wave appears to be a valid tool for intraoperative prognosis of postoperative facial nerve function in CPA surgery.

EEG recordings, psychometric and psychophysiological tests and evaluation of pulse, blood pressure and side effects were carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours; blood sampling, in addition, at hour 1. TIA plasma levels rose fast to peaks at 1-2 hours and declined rapidly as well, while the MC5 metabolite peaked in the 4th hour and declined more slowly. EEG mapping demonstrated that both TIA and FLU induced significant changes in brain function between the 1st and 8th hour, which, however, differed in their time course. 12.5 mg TIA exhibited, as compared with placebo, slight activating properties in the EEG (decrease of delta and theta, increase of alpha and beta, acceleration of the centroid), parallelled by thymopsychic improvement (mood elevation). 25 mg TIA showed EEG activation up to the 4th hour, later EEG sedation, accompanied by an initial thymopsychic improvement and differential changes thereafter (improved mood, decreased vigility), with the noopsyche improving at all times (attention, Pauli test). 50 mg FLU induced initially sedation and thereafter activation, accompanied by thymopsychic deterioration and subsequent improvement, the latter also being observed in the noopsyche (attention, memory). In pupillary and skin conductance measures, generally a slight activation occurred after placebo, which was attenuated by 25 mg TIA. Correlation maps between plasma levels and EEG changes demonstrated: the higher the TIA plasma levels, the more absolute and relative beta power, the less alpha power and the faster the centroid of the total power spectrum, reflecting CNS-activation. Topographically, the correlations were mostly seen over both fronto-temporal regions. In the latter, dominant frequency signalled desactivation in the right and activation in the left hemiphere after both antidepressants which, thereby induced changes in brain function opposite to those observed in depression.

With both formulations, there was a time-dependent increase in plasma concentration of pregnanolone with highest values 1-2 h postdosing. The model of short polygraphic recordings under resting conditions demonstrated soporific effects of pregnanolone. Compared to predosing baseline the number of sleep attempts and the time asleep increased after treatment with a peak 60 min postdosing.

Twenty-six consenting adult patients were administered 4.5-20 mg intravenous midazolam (in increments of 0.5-1 mg bolus doses every 6-10 min) until they became unresponsive to tactile stimulation (i.e., mild prodding or shaking). The EEG was continuously recorded from a bifrontal montage (FP1-Cz and FP2-Cz) to obtain the bispectral index (BI), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), median frequency (MF), and delta, theta, alpha, and beta power bands. Sedation was assessed clinically at 6-10-min intervals using the Observers' Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale, with 1 = no response (unconsciousness) to tactile stimulation to 5 = wide awake. The EEG parameters were correlated with the OAA/S scores using nonparametric Spearman's rank-correlation analysis. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance was used to determine significant changes in EEG parameters during the onset of and recovery from midazolam-induced sedation.
Of the EEG parameters studied, the BI exhibited the best correlation with OAA/S scores during both the onset (Spearman's Rho = 0.815) and recovery (Spearman's Rho = 0.596) phases. With increasing sedation, there was a progressive decrease in the BI (OAA/S score of 5: BI = 95.4 +/- 2.3; 4: 90.3 +/- 4.5; 3:86.6 +/- 4.6; 2:75.6 +/- 9.7; 1:69.2 +/- 13.9). A similar pattern was found for the 95% SEF as the OAA/S score decreased from 4 to 1. Similarly, EEG-BI increased with recovery from the sedative effects of midazolam (OAA/S score = 2:BI = 75.2 +/- 10.2; 3:82.3 +/- 7.3; 4:90.8 +/- 6). However, no consistent changes were found with the other EEG parameters. The mean EEG values between OAA/S scores 3 and 2 and between OAA/S scores 2 and 1 during the onset and recovery phases from midazolam-induced sedation, defined as EEG50 values for response to verbal command (EEG50-VC) and to shaking of the head (EEG50-SH), were 79.3 +/- 8 and 70.8 +/- 14.3, respectively, for EEG-BI. The EEG-BI displayed the smallest coefficients of variation for the EEG50-VC and EEG50-SH values.
The EEG-BI appears to be a useful parameter for assessing midazolam-induced sedation and can predict the likelihood of a patient responding to verbal commands or to shaking of the head during midazolam-induced sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8572355/

Institutional Review Board-approved prospective clinical trial.
The ten-bed intensive care unit of an university hospital.
18 consecutive patients (ten men/eight women; age: 17-73 years, mean 51.6 +/- 16.7 years, SD; body weight: 60-110 kg, mean 82.9 +/- 11.2 kg, SD) requiring mechanical ventilation and prolonged sedation/analgesia after major surgery or trauma.
Plasma propofol and alfentanil concentrations were measured at regular intervals during the long-term drug infusion using a high-performance liquid chromatography (propofol) and radioimmunoassay (alfentanil) analysis. The depth of sedation was controlled by monitoring a two-lead online EEG. Thus, drug application was computer controlled via a closed-loop EEG median-frequency feedback system.
ICU long-term infusion population pharmacokinetics (open three-compartment model) revealed for propofol: central compartment distribution volume (V1): 31.2 +/- 5.3 l; steady-state distribution volume (Vdss): 499 +/- 173 l; total clearance (Cltot): 1001- +/- 150 ml/min; redistribution half-life (t1/2 gamma): 90 +/- 23 min; elimination half-life (t1/2 beta): 558 +/- 218 minutes. For alfentanil: V1: 31.9 +/- 10.1 l; Vdss: 124 +/- 41 l; Cltot: 345 +/- 70 ml/min; t1/2 gamma: 36 +/- 15 min; t1/2 beta: 275 +/- 94 min, respectively.
The population pharmacokinetic analysis of propofol/alfentanil for ICU sedation therapy revealed increased volumes of drug distribution and decreased elimination characteristics as compared to pharmacokinetic data from short-term infusions in surgical patients. This can be attributed in part to altered distribution/redistribution processes and/or drug elimination under the condition of ICU therapy. No significant drug accumulation was observed. For future long-term sedation and analgesia of ICU patients with propofol/alfentanil, this altered pharmacokinetic behaviour should be taken into consideration to allow a more individualized and safer dosing of this drug combination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8750122/

The scalp EEG was recorded monopolarly from 16 different sites based on the 10-20 International System. Microcomputer-based hardware and RHYTHM 7.1 software were used to obtain quantitative power frequency topographic EEG data. A total of 10 normal adult volunteers were given incremental doses of propofol targeted to plasma concentrations of 0 to 1200 ng/ml.
Sedative concentrations of propofol produced a dramatic increase in beta 1, an increase in alpha 2 and beta 2, and an increase in delta activity at the largest concentration, with almost no change in theta activity. The increase in beta 1 activity had a linear correlation with plasma propofol levels (r = 0.9). Topographic mapping indicated that beta 1 activation was primarily in the frontal and central regions, with focal changes more in the left hemisphere.
Topographic brain EEG mapping techniques indicate that frontal brain beta 1 EEG activity may be useful as an objective brain index of propofol conscious sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8529332/

Fifteen patients scheduled for gynecologic surgery were anesthetized with isoflurane until burst suppression appeared in the EEG. During steady state burst suppression at 1.5 end-tidal isoflurane concentration (ETisof), each patient was given a 5-min interval each of episodes of visual, auditory, and somatosensory stimulation. During the 5-min interval of visual stimulation the patient was given 3-s episodes of 60 flashes, 4 ms duration each, at a 20-Hz frequency via redlight-emitting diode goggles. Corresponding auditory and somatosensory stimulation consisted of 60 clicks (80 dB, 0.1 ms, 20 Hz) via earphones and 60 pulses to the median nerve at the wrist (20 mA, 0.2 ms, 20 Hz). The 3-s episodes of stimulation were given at irregular intervals ranging from 5 to 20 s. End-tidal isoflurane was then increased by 0.3 vol% and 15 min later the stimulation sequence was repeated. During anesthesia at 1.5 +/- 0.1 ETisof all stimulus modalities readily evoked bursts. One hundred percent of visual stimuli, 98% +/- 4% of somatosensory stimuli, and 94% +/- 9% of auditory stimuli, given during EEG suppression, evoked bursts. Somatosensory and visual stimulation evoked bursts at both onset and offset of the 3-s episodes of stimuli. The responses to auditory stimuli were related mainly to the ending of the 3-s episode of clicks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7486108/

Eight patients with cortical parietal brain tumors, 3.3 (SD 1.3) cm in diameter, and eight control patients with lung cancer and normal brain computed tomography scans received thiopental by infusion (50-75 mg/min) until burst suppression (50% isoelectric activity) on the EEG occurred. Infusion lasted 10.7 (SD 2.4) min, and the average dose of thiopental administered was 810 (SD 170) mg [11.2 (SD 1.9) mg/kg]. During infusion the EEG was continuously recorded from the F3, F4, P3, and P4 electrodes. On-line power spectral analysis was performed, and data were saved for later analysis. Four EEG parameters [log beta (15-30 Hz) power, percent beta power, spectral edge 95% and spectral edge 70%] were plotted against calculated brain concentration of thiopental [using an assumed plasma-effect site rate constant (ke0) of 0.58] for each individual. Three points were measured on each curve (50% upslope, peak, and zero intercept) to quantitate the EEG response. Statistical comparisons were performed between the following sets of data: EEG response at electrode closest to brain tumor versus electrode farthest from tumor (in the same patient); and electrodes closest to brain tumors (parietal P3 and P4) versus same electrode pair in control patients (patients with thoracic tumors) using analysis. No differences were found in any comparison.

7574054,Validation of the alfentanil canonical univariate parameter as a measure of opioid effect on the electroencephalogram.,Anesthesiology,1995,"Gambús PL, Gregg KM, Shafer SL","Several parameters derived from the multivariate electroencephalographic (EEG) signal have been used to characterize the effects of opioids on the central nervous system. These parameters were formulated on an empirical basis. A new statistical method, semilinear canonical correlation, has been used to construct a new EEG parameter (a certain combination of the powers in the EEG power spectrum) that correlates maximally with the concentration of alfentanil at the effect site. To date, this new canonical univariate parameter (CUP) has been tested only in a small sample of subjects receiving alfentanil.
The CUP was tested on EEG data from prior studies of the effect of five opioids: alfentanil (n = 5), fentanyl (n = 15), sufentanil (n = 11), trefentanil (n = 5), and remifentanil (n = 8). We compared the CUP to the commonly used EEG parameter spectral edge, SE95%. The comparison was based on the signal to noise ratio, obtained by fitting a nonlinear pharmacodynamic model to both parameters. The pharmacodynamic parameter estimates obtained using both measurements were also compared.
The values for signal-to-noise ratio were significantly greater for the CUP than for SE95% when considering all the opioids at once. The pharmacodynamic estimates were similar between the two EEG parameters and with previously published results. Semilinear canonical correlation coefficients estimated within each drug group showed patterns similar to each other and to the coefficients in the CUP, but different from coefficients for propofol and midazolam.
Although the CUP was originally designed and tested using alfentanil, we have proven it to be a general measure of opioid effect on the EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7574054/

The EEG was recorded from frontal leads and processed variables were analyzed as a function of increasing isoflurane and desflurane concentration with age and baseline delta EEG power (0.5-3.75 Hz) as independent variables. Isoflurane and desflurane (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration [MAC]) were incrementally administered until the EEG was quiesecent at least 40% of the time. Both anesthetics were evaluated separately in each patient. By analysis of variance, isoflurane and desflurane produced dose-related increments in burst suppression which were significantly affected by the age and baseline delta EEG of the patient. When isoflurane and desflurane were equated by MAC and adjusted for age, they produced statistically similar patterns of EEG burst suppression. Within subjects, a high degree of correlation was observed for percent burst suppression between equipotent levels of isoflurane and desflurane (r = 0.85; P < 0.05). Patients with baseline delta EEG power less than 80% of total power showed increases in delta EEG and decreases in median frequency with isoflurane and desflurane. Patients with baseline delta EEG power > 80% of total power produced no change in EEG frequency with increasing anesthesia but revealed a greater sensitivity to the development of burst suppression. These results show that isoflurane and desflurane produce similar EEG suppression in neurosurgical patients. If the EEG is initially slow, further slowing cannot be used to assess anesthetic depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7574015/

The lipophilic brain SPECT agent, [99mTc]hexamethylpropylene aminoxime (HMPAO), was administered intravenously during the procedure to determine the intracerebral distribution of methohexital. The validity of the ISM depends on consistent delivery of the anesthetizing agent to one hemisphere, including the mesial structures of the temporal lobe. To prevent postoperative language and memory deficits, correct interpretation of the test results supposes a reliable knowledge of which regions of the brain have been anesthetized. Currently, no absolute criteria allow determination of the level and topographical extent of the anesthesia. We compared results of HMPAO-SPECT with clinical and EEG video-monitoring data and with results of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed during the test. In all patients, the effect of SM was ipsilateral cerebral hypoperfusion on SPECT and crossed cerebellar diaschisis. The distribution of HMPAO varied from patient to patient. The delivery of SM to mesial temporal lobe structures was not constant. Using nonparametric tests, we demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between hypoperfusion on SPECT and duration of hemiplegia but not with the duration of aphasia. Hypoperfusion on SPECT was also related to the onset and duration of drug-induced delta activity on EEG. SPECT showed a statistically different distribution of SM in the brain from that predicted with DSA. We present our experience with HMPAO-SPECT use for mapping the distribution of methohexital's effects during the ISM (Wada test). We confirm the results of previous studies that SPECT assessment may be an excellent way of determining the distribution of barbiturate during the examination. It increases confidence in interpreting results of speech and memory testing by detecting either contralateral diffusion of the drug due to crossflow between hemispheres or insufficient quantitative delivery to the homolateral hemisphere.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7555955/

AER were generated by averaging 512 sweeps each of 125-ms duration. In children less than 2 yr of age, the AER was often irregular, whereas children older than 2 yr had AER patterns similar to those in adults. In children less than 2 yr, regular artefact activity was superimposed on the background EEG which was at the same frequency as the instantaneous heart rate and which was often identifiable as the ECG. We conclude that the AER may be unreliable in children less than 2 yr of age, and modification of current methodology may be required if this technique is to become useful in paediatric anaesthetic practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7488482/

Intravenous pentobarbital therapy was successful and without distinct sequelae in all 3 patients, and could be incrementally discontinued without breakthrough seizures after 12-65 hours of a burst-suppression or complete suppression pattern on EEG. Obtaining a suppression pattern was important for controlling status epilepticus in children as well as adults. We suggest that 12 hours after a burst-suppression pattern is obtained, tapering of pentobarbital should be attempted to avoid serious complications of extended pentobarbital anesthesia (e.g., respiratory depression, hypotension, pneumonia).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8534284/

Since the clinical efficacy of ECT depends on the induction of a seizure of adequate duration, it is important to determine the optimal dose of the hypnotic for use during ECT. We compared the duration of seizure activity and cognitive recovery profiles after different doses of methohexital, propofol, and etomidate administered to induce hypnosis prior to ECT. Ten outpatients with major depressive disorders receiving maintenance ECT participated in this prospective, randomized, cross-over study. Patients were premedicated with glycopyrrolate, 0.2 mg intravenously (i.v.), and labetalol, 20-30 mg i.v., and hypnosis was induced with an i.v. bolus injection of methohexital or propofol (0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/kg), or etomidate (0.15, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg), administered over 10-15 s. Adequate muscle paralysis was achieved with succinylcholine, 1.0-1.4 mg/kg i.v. Each patient's seizure threshold was determined prior to enrollment in the study and the electrical stimulus variables were kept constant throughout the study period. After delivery of a bilateral electrical stimulus, the duration of the resulting electroencephalographic (EEG) and motor seizures were recorded. A total of 90 ECT treatments were evaluated. The durations of EEG and motor seizures were longest after etomidate and shortest after propofol. There were no significant dose-related differences in motor and EEG seizure durations (means +/- SD) after the low, intermediate, and high doses of etomidate of 44 +/- 11 and 77 +/- 19, 43 +/- 10 and 76 +/- 34, 42 +/- 16 and 78 +/- 56 s, respectively.

EEG samples of 2-4 min were taken during 4 states: alertness, stage 2-3 sleep, light surgical anesthesia permitting the patient to respond to questions and electrical seizures. Coherence was computed for all frequencies from 1 to 50 Hz or 0.3-100 Hz; for comparisons the mean coherence over each of 6 or 7 narrower bands between 2 and 70 Hz was used. Whereas the literature supports the view that EEG coherence is usually substantial over many centimeters, the hypothesis here tested--and found to be well above stochastic expectations--is that significant structure occurs in the millimeter domain for EEG recorded subdurally or within the brain. In both the subdural surface samples and those from temporal lobe depth electrode arrays coherence declines with distance between electrodes of the pair, on the average quite severely in millimeters. This is nearly the same for all frequency bands. For middle bands like 8-13 and 13-20 Hz, mean coherence typically declines most steeply in the first 10 mm, from values indistinguishable from 1.0 at < 0.5 mm distance to 0.5 at 5-10 mm and to 0.25 in another 10-20 mm in the subdural surface data. Temporal lobe depth estimates decline about half as fast; coherence > or = 0.5 extends for 9-20 mm and > or = 0.25 for another 20-35mm. Low frequency bands (1-5, 5-8 Hz) usually fall slightly more slowly than high frequency bands (20-35, 35-50 Hz but the difference is small and variance large. The steepness of decline with distance in humans is significantly but only slightly smaller than that we reported earlier for the rabbit and rat, averaging less than one half. Local coherence, for individual pairs of loci, shows differentiation in the millimeter range, i.e., nearest neighbor pairs may be locally well above or below average and this is sustained over minutes. Local highs and lows tend to be similar for widely different frequency bands. Coherence varies quite independently of power, although they are sometimes correlated. Regional differentiation is statistically significant in average coherence among pairs of loci on temporal vs frontal cortex or lateral frontal vs. subfrontal strips in the same patient, but such differences are usually small.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7555907/

Electroencephalography (EEG) can detect ischemic brain cell dysfunction before irreversible injury. The carotid stump back pressure (CSP) has been inconsistent in determining the need for shunting, and contralateral carotid disease has had a variable impact. The purpose of this study was to evaluate CSP and operative EEG changes, and to determine the effect of contralateral carotid artery disease on determining the need for carotid shunting.
In 140 consecutive carotid procedures, operative EEG and CSP were monitored, and contralateral carotid disease was documented. The carotid stump pressure/mean arterial pressure index (CSP/MAP) was also calculated to determine if this was a better indicator of the need for shunting than the CSP alone.
There was a 58% incidence of EEG changes when the CSP was < or = 25 mm Hg, 32% with a CSP of 26 to 50 mm Hg, and 4% with a CSP > 50 mm Hg. There was a 43% incidence of EEG changes and lower CSP among patients with a contralateral occlusion, both of which were significantly different from patients with a patent contralateral carotid artery. Three patients with CSP > 50 mm Hg had EEG changes, but none had a contralateral occlusion. Two patients had permanent neurologic deficits, and 2 had transient deficits. Excluding combined procedures, operative stroke rate was 0.8%.
A CSP of < 50 mm Hg achieved a sensitivity of 89% in patients who developed ischemic EEG changes during carotid clamping, and a pressure > 50 mm Hg had a negative predictive value of 96%. However, a CSP of < 50 mm Hg had a positive predictive value of only 36%. Neither the addition of the status of the contralateral carotid artery or the calculation of the CSP/MAP improved the sensitivity of the CSP in determining the need for shunting.

We reviewed the medical record of each patient scheduled to undergo carotid endarterectomy and recorded the patient's age and history of previous neurological symptoms. We then continuously monitored and analyzed 16 channels of anteroposterior bipolar EEG and two of referential derivations from at least 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia and throughout the operation.
We completed 394 consecutive studies. Preoperative neurological symptoms were related to EEG abnormalities in awake patients (P < .001) and to EEG asymmetries in anesthetized patients (P < .001). Abnormal awake EEG findings were associated with asymmetries after anesthesia (P < .0001). Twenty-eight percent of both symptomatic (70/249) and asymptomatic (41/145) patients had EEG ischemic pattern changes at carotid artery cross-clamp. Neither neurological symptoms nor EEG abnormalities were associated with age or the development of EEG ischemic pattern changes at carotid artery cross-clamp.
Despite the strong association between a history of cerebral ischemic symptoms and preoperative EEG abnormalities in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, patients who have suffered strokes or transient ischemic events are at no greater risk of having EEG evidence of cerebral ischemia during carotid artery cross-clamp than patients without symptoms and with normal baseline EEGs.

We hypothesized that ketamine would not increase intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity in anesthetized, ventilated patients. Twenty patients requiring craniotomy for brain tumor or cerebral aneurysm were studied. After induction with thiopental, anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. During controlled ventilation (PaCO2 34 +/- 1 mm Hg); middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (VMCA), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), bilateral frontooccipital processed electroencephalogram (EEG), and ICP were measured before and for 10 min after intravenous ketamine 1.0 mg/kg. Cerebral arteriovenous oxygen content difference (AVDO2) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were calculated. After ketamine, MAP, CPP, PaCO2, and AVDO2 were unchanged. ICP decreased from 16 +/- 1 mm Hg to 14 +/- 1 mm Hg (mean +/- SE; P < 0.001) and VMCA decreased from 44 +/- 4 cm/s to 39 +/- 4 cm/s (P < 0.001). Total EEG power decreased (P < 0.02). These results suggest that ketamine can be used in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated patients with mildly increased ICP without adversely altering cerebral hemodynamics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7598288/
7549376,Electrophysiological monitoring and mild hypothermia.,Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,1995,Kochs E,"Hypothermia affects cerebral metabolism including a variety of neurotransmitter systems. Neurophysiologic changes during hypothermia are characterized by decreases in the membrane resting potential and amplitude. The duration of the action potential is prolonged and nerve conduction velocity is decreased. Nonsynaptic responses are reduced to a lesser extent than synaptic responses. Mild hypothermia to 33.5 degrees C produces only minimal changes in the EEG with small shifts in frequencies to theta- and beta-activity. Electro-cerebral silence occurs at a temperature below 22-25 degrees C. Evoked potentials (EP) of all modalities are affected by hypothermia to a similar degrees. Amplitudes are decreased and latencies are prolonged. Cortical EP components are more profoundly affected than early, subcortical potentials. EP may be reliably recorded at temperatures > 25 degrees C. Changes in EEG and EP are not specific for hypothermia. In addition, a hysteresis between cooling and rewarming has to be taken into account for the interpretation of temperature effects on brain electrical activity. The interactive effects of anesthetics and temperature may preclude EEG and EP measure for a graded quantification of hypothermia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7549376/

Hemodynamic, central nervous system, and respiratory monitoring were used for safety assessment. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was evaluated as a surrogate measure of drug effect. Butorphanol was chosen as the control drug. In the mirfentanil group (n = 8) the dose was increased in sequential subjects from 25 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 30 min to 450 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 15 min, and in the butorphanol group (n = 10) from 2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 30 min to 25 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 15 min. In the mirfentanil group, serious side effects were observed at plasma concentrations more than 2000 ng/mL: heart rates exceeded 130 bpm (n = 2), epileptiform EEG potentials (n = 2), and a convulsion (n = 1). The clearance of mirfentanil was high (5.8-7.2 L/min), and the volume of distribution large (247-348 L). The EEG of the subjects receiving mirfentanil showed no changes typical for opioids. Butorphanol however, caused intermittent slowing in the delta and theta ranges.

In the present study, 12 patients suffering from schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder with predominantly positive symptomatology were treated in an open clinical trial for 4 weeks with seroquel at a maximum dosage of 750 mg/day. The drug was generally well tolerated, and virtually no adverse extrapyramidal side effects such as acute dystonia, parkinsonism or akathisia were observed. Total scores for BPRS (item score 0-6; baseline: 42.0 +/- 2.3; mean +/- SEM), SAPS (64.5 +/- 4.8) and SANS (55.0 +/- 4.3) showed a moderate decrease at the end of treatment (BPRS: 30.0 +/- 3.5; SAPS: 36.1 +/- 6.7; SANS: 42.5 +/- 5.9), when intention-to-treat analysis was applied. There were considerable interindividual differences in treatment response, with some subjects showing almost full remission of positive symptoms, in contrast to about half of the patients who showed no satisfactory clinical improvement. Interestingly, patients showing good antipsychotic response reported slight initial side effects like mild sedation. Prolactin and TSH levels were not altered during seroquel administration. As to pharmaco-EEG investigations, seroquel caused a moderate increase of the absolute power in the alpha, theta, and beta frequency bands, paralleled by a decrease of delta activity. There were no signs of paroxysmal EEG activity under seroquel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7659771/

Fifty women undergoing general anaesthesia for elective Caesarean section were examined. Responsiveness to verbal commands was detected every minute in the period from the induction of anaesthesia to the delivery of the newborn using the Tunstall isolated forearm technique and correlated with the SEF90 value. The patients were assigned by a randomized code to receive either thiopentone (4 mg.kg-1) or ketamine (1 mg.kg-1) for induction of anaesthesia. Before the administration of succinylcholine a tourniquet was applied to the free arm, and inflated to 200 mmHg, to maintain motor function to one arm. The EEG recordings started five minutes before induction and were recorded throughout anaesthesia. The incidence of responsiveness to verbal commands was lower in the ketamine group (24%) where the average SEF90 was 12.0 +/- 3 Hz, than in the thiopentone group (52%), where the average SEF90 was 18.09 +/- 3 Hz (P = 0.01).

This study used a new technique of EEG analysis, bispectral analysis, which measures interfrequency phase relationships in the EEG. Using a reference database, and a process of multivariate discriminant analysis, we developed a univariate bispectral variable, the bispectral index (BIS). This study was designed to test the efficacy of BIS in predicting movement to incision during either an isoflurane/alfentanil anesthetic or a propofol/alfentanil anesthetic technique. Fifty consenting patients were randomized to two groups; one received isoflurane/alfentanil and the other, propofol/alfentanil for anesthesia. EEG was recorded using a microcomputer system and the data were analyzed off-line. Hemodynamic variables were also recorded. After skin incision, each patient was observed carefully for 2 min to detect purposeful movement. A significant difference was found between the BIS values for movers versus nonmovers within each of the two treatment groups (P < or = 0.002). However, isoflurane/alfentanil nonmovers could not be distinguished from propofol/alfentanil movers (P < or = 0.180), suggesting a treatment group effect independent of response classification. Preincision hemodynamic variables did not predict patient movement in response to skin incision. These findings suggest the possibility that different anesthetics have different effects on BIS, and thus BIS may not be independent of the anesthetic. Interfrequency phase coupling, a nonlinear feature of the EEG which is measured with bispectral analysis, may contain clinically useful information for the assessment of anesthetic adequacy. In this study, BIS was a better predictor of patient response than other currently available variables including hemodynamic status.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7893035/

Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2.5 mg/kg, fentanyl 3 micrograms/kg (followed by an infusion of 2 micrograms/kg/h), vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg, and maintained with a propofol infusion (250-300 micrograms/kg/min) sufficient to induce EEG silence. A transcranial Doppler was used to measure the Vmca and a jugular bulb catheter was inserted for oxygen saturation and glucose use measurements. After a 15-period of isoelectric EEG and normocapnia (PaCO2 38 +/- 1 mm Hg), baseline arterial and jugular bulb venous blood gases were drawn, and mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and Vmca were recorded. Nitrous oxide was then introduced and equilibrated to an end-tidal concentration of 70% for 15 min, after which MAP, HR, Vmca, arterial and jugular bulb venous blood gases were measured again. Nitrous oxide increased Vmca (29 +/- 4 to 35 +/- 4 cm/s, p < 0.01), cerebral use of oxygen (166 +/- 13 to 190 +/- 12 vol%-cm/s, p < 0.05) and glucose (245 +/- 38 to 290 +/- 48 g%-cm/s, p < 0.05) by approximately 20%.

The purpose of this study was to measure CBF and EEG during N2O administration in eight patients. A craniotomy was performed and CBF was measured in major brain arteries using a transit time Doppler flowmeter. EEG was recorded bilaterally from frontooccipital leads. Power spectrum analysis was performed on the EEG and power for delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands analyzed over time. Arterial blood pressure was recorded continuously. N2O (66%) was added to the inspired gases during isoflurane anesthesia (0.8% end tidal) under hypocapnic (Paco2 = 29 mm Hg) and normocapnic conditions (Paco2 = 39 mm Hg). During hypocapnia, N2O administration decreased alpha EEG activity and increased delta activity but did not change CBF. During normacapnia, N2O produced similar but greater changes in EEG and increased CBF 39%. In three patients, the isoflurane concentration was increased to 1.6% end tidal during normocapnia. N2O administration in these patients also enhanced delta EEG activity and increased CBF. The slowing of EEG activity with N2O is temporally related to increases in CBF during normocapnia. Hypocapnia abolished the increase in CBF during N2O and attenuated the shift of EEG to delta activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7772972/

The effects of sedative doses of propofol on epileptiform activities in patients suffering from intractable partial epilepsy were systematically investigated.
Fourteen patients suffering from complex partial seizures were studied. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from intracranial electrodes implanted in the hippocampi and temporal neocortex. Propofol was given as a computer-controlled infusion in four steps to achieve target plasma propofol concentrations of 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 micrograms/ml. Each concentration was maintained for 30 min, and steady-state kinetics were confirmed by blood levels drawn at 10th and 30th min at each level. Between the 15th and 30th min of each concentration of propofol, EEG was analyzed for presence of electroencephalographic seizure activity and/or number of interictal spikes (IIS). Effects of propofol on IIS frequency at different electrode sites were compared using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant.
None of the patients developed a seizure during the 2 h of propofol infusion. No ""false spikes"" (spikes developing with propofol infusion in areas where no spikes were seen in baseline EEG) were seen. Although effects of propofol on IIS frequency were highly variable across patients and at different propofol doses in the same patient, there was no statistically significant effect of propofol on any electrode site with any of the doses studied.

Fifteen healthy volunteers (8 males and 7 females), aged 20-35 years, received randomized and at weekly intervals 40 and 80 mg caroverine intravenously, 40 and 80 mg caroverine orally, as well as placebo. EEG recordings, psychometric and psychophysiological tests, as well as evaluation of pulse, blood pressure and side-effects were carried out at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. Multivariate analysis of EEG mapping data demonstrated that caroverine exerted a significant action on human brain function, as compared with placebo, at all given dosages, as early as in the 1st and as late as in the 8th hour after both intravenous and oral administration during resting (R-EEG) and vigilance-controlled recording (V-EEG). Subsequent univariate analyses revealed, however, differential effects of caroverine--dependent on recording conditions and doses. In the resting condition, an increase of absolute and relative delta and theta power, a decrease of alpha and beta power and a slowing of the centroid of the delta and theta activity occurred, reflecting sedative action. The latter was slightly time- and dose-dependent (more sedation in earlier hours after higher doses). However, in the vigilance-controlled EEG, a dose-dependent decrease of delta and theta power, an increase of alpha power and an acceleration of the centroid of the delta and theta suggested vigilance-promoting effects, which were more pronounced in the later than earlier hours. Psychometric investigations confirmed these differential central effects. In regard to the noopsyche, an improvement was noted 6 h after the lowest oral dose. In the thymopsyche, a deterioration occurred after all doses except the highest oral dose, suggesting sedation. The latter was also seen after all active compounds as a trend in psychophysiological variables. The drug was well tolerated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7741773/

Patients in group A (60) received i.v., at random, 20 mg of nefopam, 50 mg of meperidine or 150 micrograms of clonidine in the immediate postoperative period. The incidence of shivering and the time at which shivering ceased were noted, along with central temperature and main haemodynamic changes. Group B (20) received i.v., at random, either 10 mg of nefopam or saline before awakening from anaesthesia. The effects of nefopam on central temperature, oxygen consumption (Vo2), carbon dioxide production (VcO2), basal metabolic rate (BMR) and energy expenditure (EE) were investigated. Group C (10) received i.v. 20 mg of nefopam during surgery: cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and electroencephalogram (EEG) were monitored. In group A nefopam stopped shivering in 95% of patients when compared to meperidine and clonidine, which were effective in 32% and 40% of patients respectively. In group B, only 10% of patients receiving nefopam had postoperative shivering, Vo2, VcO2 and EE were significantly lower in patients treated with nefopam than those in the control group.

Whether this ""seizure activity"" is primarily, secondarily, or not at all a cerebral cortical event is still to be elucidated. Clearly propofol does have anticonvulsant activity, and also clearly it can produce an involuntary movement disorder, in certain patients, under certain conditions. Propofol is not the first anaesthetic drug to be implicated in the causation of seizures or abnormal movements nor indeed the first to appear to have anti-convulsant and proconvulsant activity (e.g. Althesin). While propofol has undoubtedly proved a very useful drug, the problem of convulsive phenomena creates a degree of background concern about its use. More needs to be known about the mechanism of this complication and any risk factors involved in determining who may have a seizure after propofol. In the clinical setting, the reporting of seizures possibly related to propofol should include--medical history, including personal or family history of epilepsy and movement disorders; a history of previous anaesthetics and whether propofol was used; regular medications; use of drugs or alcohol; history of chemical dependency; emotional state prior to induction; presence of hyperventilation or fever; a description of the alleged seizure, including rate of administration of propofol and amount given, time of onset of seizure in relation to time of drug administration, speed of onset of signs, quality of the abnormal movements, part of body involved, duration, any indication of a postictal state, any cardiovascular changes which may have accompanied the seizure, and any other possible triggers for the reaction such as other drugs used, including premedication; post seizure investigations including temperature, blood sugar, electrolytes, arterial gas analysis, neurological examination, EEG and CT scan. These actions and these investigations concerning propofol should not be delayed. It would appear appropriate to recommend to patients who experience apparent convulsive phenomena after propofol that they not be re-exposed to the drug.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7892985/

EEG is then used as a measure of the depth of anaesthesia, burst suppression being an easily identified EEG pattern. In this case report we describe epileptiform discharges during EEG suppression in two children undergoing barbiturate anaesthesia for treatment of intractable seizures. One of them had focal, rhythmic discharges of negative spikes on the positive suppression level. Bursts were readily produced by visual stimuli with flashes of red light but this did not increase the frequency of focal spike discharges after bursts. The other patient had generalised, high amplitude spike-wave complexes, which were easy to distinguish from the bursts. We emphasise that it is important to make a distinction between electrocerebral silence, or isoelectric EEG as it was previously called, from EEG suppression. It is also important to distinguish epileptiform discharges from bursts, if the intention is to keep the anaesthesia at EEG burst suppression level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7885540/

The intravenous administration of midazolam led to activation of the lower beta range (13-18 Hz) and the subsequent injection of ketamine caused an increase in activity in the fast beta range (21-30 Hz), both being accompanied by a reduction of delta power from 56% to 40%.

Under normal hemodynamic conditions, hypothermia initially produced N20 disappearance at a mean nasopharyngeal temperature of 20.4 +/- 2.6 degrees C (range 14.5 to 26.1 degrees C) and P14 disappearance at a mean of 16.9 +/- 2.0 degrees C (range 12.4 to 20.2 degrees C). On rewarming, P14 reappeared at mean temperature of 19.3 +/- 4.0 degrees C (range 13.5 to 29.2 degrees C) and N20 at a mean of 21.1 +/- 4.1 degrees C (range 14.3 to 29.6 degrees C). The delay of SEP reappearance after restoration of blood flow correlated significantly with CA duration (r = 0.74 for P14, and r = 0.62 for N20; p < 0.01). Neurological recovery was uneventful in 23 patients; 5 patients presented with neurological sequelae (minor or transient in 4; no recovery from anesthesia and death after 48 hours in 1), and 4 patients died during operation. Twenty-three of 24 surviving patients in whom P14 disappearance was the criterion that hypothermia was deep enough to perform CA (duration: 17 to 94 min) had a normal neurological outcome. By contrast, all surviving patients in whom cortical SEPs disappeared at higher temperatures presented neurological sequelae.

First, we determined in nine volunteers the electroencephalographic (EEG) effects and the trefentanil infusion rate that gave maximal EEG changes in 3 to 10 minutes. Then, in a crossover fashion in five volunteers, we compared the pharmacokinetics and EEG pharmacodynamics of trefentanil with fentanyl and alfentanil. Finally, we used computer simulations to predict offset of opioid effects of trefentanil, fentanyl, and alfentanil when given in different dosing schemes.
The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile of trefentanil was similar to alfentanil, except for a higher elimination clearance. Trefentanil versus alfentanil pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: Elimination clearance, 0.444 +/- 0.073 versus 0.184 +/- 0.031 L/min; steady-state distribution volume, 37 +/- 7 versus 23 +/- 3 L; and elimination half-life, 127 +/- 24 versus 114 +/- 19 minutes. Trefentanil versus alfentanil pharmacodynamics were as follows: the equilibration half-time between EEG effect and arterial drug concentration, 1.2 +/- 0.5 versus 0.6 +/- 0.4 minutes; and the concentration resulting in 50% of maximal EEG effect, 429 +/- 313 versus 577 +/- 273 ng/ml. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile of fentanyl was significantly different from trefentanil and alfentanil. Simulation of effect compartment concentration decay curves after variable-length infusions predicted more rapid recovery from trefentanil than from alfentanil or fentanyl.

8053591,The electroencephalogram does not predict depth of isoflurane anesthesia.,Anesthesiology,1994,"Dwyer RC, Rampil IJ, Eger EI, Bennett HL","The power spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) may be analyzed to provide quantitative measures of EEG activity (e.g., spectral edge, which defines the highest EEG frequency at which significant activity is found). The current study tested the hypothesis that spectral edge and similar measures distinguish different functional depths of anesthesia in humans.
Three groups were studied. Group 1 consisted of 34 surgical patients (ASA physical status 1 or 2) who received 0.6, 1.0 and 1.4 MAC isoflurane anesthesia. A subgroup (group 2) of group 1 was tested during 1.0 MAC isoflurane anesthesia at surgical incision. Group 3 consisted of 16 volunteers who listened to an audiotape while receiving 0.15, 0.3, and 0.45 MAC isoflurane or 0.3, 0.45, and 0.6 MAC nitrous oxide in oxygen. The audiotape contained information designed to test implicit and explicit memory formation. We tested the ability of six EEG parameters (spectral-edge, 95th percentile power frequency, median power, and zero crossing frequencies and total power in the alpha- [8-13 Hz] and delta- [< 4 Hz] power ranges) to predict movement after surgical incision, purposeful response to command, or memory of information presented during anesthetic administration.
Isoflurane decreased EEG activity in group 1 in a dose-related fashion. The 55% of group 2 who made purposeful movements in response to incision did not differ in their EEG from nonresponders (e.g., spectral edge 19.8 +/- 3.1 vs. 19.3 +/- 2.6 Hz, mean +/- SD). In group 3, memory of the information presented did not correlate with values of any EEG parameter. Response to verbal command was associated with lower anesthetic concentrations and with smaller alpha- and delta-band power (298 +/- 66 vs. 401 +/- 80 watts; and 75 +/- 20 vs. 121 +/- 49 watts, mean +/- SD), but there was no difference in values for other parameters.

Anaesthesia was induced with a bolus thiamylal (5 mg.kg-1 iv) followed by succinylcholine (1 mg.kg-1). Tracheal intubation was attempted one minute after the injection of succinylcholine. The EEG was monitored by a computerized aperiodic analysis device, the Lifescan (Neurometrics, San Diego, CA) using the activity edge (AE) to detect brain electrical activity. After induction of anaesthesia, systolic blood pressure (sBP) decreased by 11% from the baseline value, and the AE decreased from 13.0 Hz to 3.4 Hz. Following tracheal intubation, the sBP increased from the post-induction values by 44% (P < 0.05), and the AE increased to 13.1 Hz (P < 0.05) simultaneously. In conclusion, rapid-sequence induction using thiamylal (5 mg.kg-1) caused depression in brain activity as assessed by AE, while laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation caused an increase in activity. This indicates that this dose of thiamylal for rapid-sequence induction may not be sufficient to sustain an adequate anaesthetic level and blunt the haemodynamic responses to intubation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7923518/

It was assumed that P300 largely reflects the time to evaluate a stimulus while reaction time (RT) reflects this time plus the time to select and execute a response. Twelve subjects were administered 0.25 mg triazolam in a repeated measures single-blind design. A visual 80-20% oddball task was used in which stimulus intensity and signal quality were manipulated with accuracy of responding held constant at a high level. RT and EEG data were collected simultaneously and the P300 elicited by the low probability stimuli was measured on a single trial basis. Triazolam slowed RT (172 ms, P < 0.0003) more than P300 (88 ms, P < 0.0007), but both measures exhibited a drug x stimulus intensity interaction. RT also exhibited a drug x signal quality interaction but P300 did not. These results suggest that triazolam has selective effects on perceptual processing by slowing an early pre-processing stage but not a later feature extraction stage. In addition, the drug appears to slow some aspect of response processing. This evidence is taken as support for a multiple process rather than a general sedation view of benzodiazepine effects on stages of processing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7871096/

Observations on processed EEG and spectral edge frequency.,International journal of clinical monitoring and computing,1994,Gurman GM,"The daily use of muscle relaxants and the lack of correlation between the hemodynamic behavior and stages of general anesthesia represent the main obstacles in defining the level of cortical activity depression by the anesthetic drugs. Since classical EEG is cumbersome in the operating room, and demands special knowledge, computerized methods of EEG wave analysis have more or less replaced the 'raw' display of the electrical activity of CNS. The paper describes the place of spectral edge frequency (SEF), one of the parameters obtained by processing the EEG waves, in the list of variables which could be monitored during general anesthesia. Besides, our preliminary observations on a combination of mean blood pressure variations and SEF value are presented. In fact, we designed a hypothetical matrix of those two parameters, which seems to be a useful tool for guiding the general anesthesia. SEF kept in a pre-established range (usually 8-12 Hz) seems to be linked with a more evident hemo-dynamic stability. Some data also suggested that a stable SEF on that range contributed to a higher degree of immediate postoperative analgesia after Cesarean section. The limits of SEF oblige the scientists to go on looking for other monitored parameters, to be studied in correlation with processed EEG. Further studies are needed, in order to improve the anesthesiologist's capabilities to define correctly the stage of general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7829937/

The EEG patterns during steady state end-tidal concentrations of isoflurane (0.7-1.1%) or enflurane (0.8-1.3%) showed highest activity in the frontal and occipital areas. At near awakening the frontal and occipital dominance of delta activity disappeared in both groups and was replaced by homogeneous delta activity over the entire cortex; variations in the topographical distribution of enflurane and isoflurane were recorded in the other spectral bands. We conclude that changes in topographic EEG patterns observed during the transition from surgical anaesthesia to emergence, in particular the disappearance of frontal and occipital dominance of delta activity common to isoflurane and enflurane, may serve to detect undesirably light levels of anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7829936/

This study evaluated clinical pharmacodynamic approaches to distinguishing these two classes of compounds.
Healthy volunteers received single oral doses of placebo, the benzodiazepine agonist triazolam (0.25 mg) or the azaperone anxiolytic buspirone (20 mg), in a double-blind, three-way crossover study. Ratings of mood and sedation, performance on the digit symbol substitution test (DSST), and quantitative measures of electroencephalographic (EEG) beta activity (13 to 31.75 cycles/sec) determined by fast-Fourier transform were obtained at multiple times after dosage.
Triazolam significantly increased self- and observer-rated sedation, impaired DSST performance, impaired recall, and increased EEG beta activity. Pharmacodynamic changes were significantly intercorrelated; all effects were maximal 1 to 2 hours after dosage but were indistinguishable from placebo by 8 hours. Buspirone did not alter the EEG or DSST performance but did increase self-ratings of sedation and feeling ""spacey"" and impaired memory function; these effects generally were quantitatively less than with triazolam. Peak plasma triazolam concentrations preceded maximum pharmacodynamic effects; the mean plasma effect site equilibration half-life was 9.4 minutes. Kinetic-dynamic modeling procedures yielded significant relationships between hypothetical effect site triazolam concentrations and pharmacodynamic changes.
Quantitative analysis of the EEG clearly distinguishes a typical benzodiazepine agonist from a nonagonist anxiolytic, in clinically relevant dosage, whose pharmacodynamic actions do not involve benzodiazepine receptor occupancy.

Muscle relaxants, barbiturate anesthesia, and oxygenation were developed to reduce the risks of fracture, fear, and cognitive deficits. Unilateral electrode placement elicited fewer cognitive complaints and was reported as clinically effective as bilateral placement. Seizure duration monitoring, first by cuff and then by EEG, was introduced to define ""an effective seizure"". Caffeine pre-treatment lengthened seizure durations. Brief pulse square wave currents replaced sinusoidal currents to reduce cognitive effects. Twice weekly treatments were shown to be as effective as three treatments weekly, although the latter was more rapidly effective. Continuation ECT became a feature of practice. The safety and efficacy of psychoactive drugs combined with ECT were clarified so that antipsychotic drugs now are generally continued; benzodiazepines, lithium, and anticonvulsants are withdrawn; and the continuation of antidepressant drugs is optional. In recent studies, the minimal energy needed to elicit a seizure was determined and energy dosing is suggested as 2.5 times [or other multiple] of the threshold. Others find that age or half-age dosing methods are satisfactory and with less risk to patients.

Data were recorded over 20 min. Groups 1 and 3 were studied without surgery (as controls). In groups 2 and 4 recording was started 6 min before skin incision. The EEG was acquired via 17 scalp electrodes placed in standard International 10-20 locations (reference Cz). Absolute and relative power densities were calculated in selected frequency bands. EEG maps of spectral power densities were coded according to a continuous color spectrum.
During baseline recordings, alpha activity was dominant at frontal areas in groups 1 and 2. In comparison, in groups 3 and 4, delta and theta activities were dominant at frontal leads. In group 2, the start of surgery resulted in increases in delta activity and decreases in alpha activity that were most dominant frontally (delta +181% and alpha -61%, F3). The delta shift was attenuated at 1.2% isoflurane (group 4, delta +44%, F3), but decreases in alpha activity (-53%, F3) were comparable to those in group 2. The EEG response in all frequency bands was attenuated at parietotemporal recording sites at both isoflurane concentrations.
The current data demonstrate graded EEG responses induced by abdominal surgery during anesthesia with 0.6% or 1.2% isoflurane in 66% nitrous oxide. Spatial heterogeneities in absolute spectral power densities were reflected by color changes in the EEG maps. The topographic EEG analysis indicates that these changes were most dominant at frontal areas. The increases in delta and decreases in alpha activities may be related to intraoperative ""paradoxical"" electrophysiologic arousal phenomena.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8017642/

Correlations between changes in EEG spectral power and subjective self-reports, as measured on subscales of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), were evaluated. Morphine increased alpha 1 and alpha 2 power and theta power, and attenuated the increase in delta power observed after placebo. Positive correlations were found between the change in alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 2 power in response to 30 mg of morphine and scores on Morphine-Benzedrine Group (MBG) subscale of the ARCI. Negative relationships were observed between changes in alpha 1, and beta 2 and scores on the Pentobarbital Chlorpromazine Alcohol Group (PCAG) subscale. The findings indicate that positive subjective effects of opioids, as measured by the MBG subscale, are related to increases in alpha and beta activity and are associated with reduction of opioid-induced sedation, as measured by the PCAG subscale.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7916914/

RSA and the electroencephalogram (EEG) were monitored in 10 patients undergoing elective surgery with isoflurane and nitrous oxide in oxygen anaesthesia after induction with propofol. All patients were subject to controlled ventilation and recovery from competitive neuromuscular block was facilitated by neostigmine and glycopyrronium (seven patients) or atropine (three patients). Median and spectral edge (95%) frequencies of the raw EEG were derived off-line. RSA and EEG indices were obtained during preinduction (baseline), induction, incision, 0.65 and 1.2 MAC of isoflurane maintenance during surgery and recovery. Significant decreases in the level of RSA, median and spectral edge frequencies were observed during induction and significant increases in all indices were observed at recovery in all patients. Significant decreases in the median and spectral edge EEG frequencies occurred in patients treated with atropine both to counteract bradycardia after propofol induction and at antagonism of neuromuscular block (n = 3), compared with patients treated with glycopyrronium (n = 7). In contrast, the level of RSA did not decrease significantly with atropine. It is concluded that measurements of RSA could form the basis of a useful index of anaesthetic depth during isoflurane anaesthesia, even during the use of pharmacologically appropriate doses of atropine. However, any effects of atropine on the raw EEG and on indices derived from the EEG, should be characterized further so that these effects are not confused with changes in anaesthetic depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8155438/

The effect of isoflurane on the shape, amplitude and latency of SEPs was evaluated. SEPs were recorded at awake, 1 MAC, 1.5 MAC, at electroencephalogram (EEG) burst suppression and at continuous suppression levels. Finally, SEPs were recorded when anaesthesia was lightened back to 1 MAC. The peak latency and amplitude of the first cortical N20 wave were measured. The latencies increased with increasing isoflurane concentrations. At high concentrations only an almost monophasic N20 wave was recorded, reduced in shape and amplitude. No specific changes could be correlated with the burst suppression or suppression patterns. This suggests that EEG and SEP generators are differently affected with increasing isoflurane concentration. The results indicate that SEPs can also be recorded in drug-induced EEG suppression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8023658/

Anpirtoline exhibits analgesia which is possibly mediated via serotoninergic pathways, whereas tramadol exerts its effects at opioid receptors. The pain-relieving effect of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine may involve both serotoninergic and opioid mechanisms. Chemo-somatosensory event-related potentials (CSSERP) were recorded after painful stimulation of the nasal mucosa with carbon dioxide. Subjects rated the perceived intensity of the stimuli by means of a visual analogue scale. In addition, acoustically evoked responses were recorded, the spontaneous EEG was analyzed in the frequency domain, the subjects' vigilance was assessed in a tracking task, and side effects of the drugs were monitored. Anpirtoline and tramadol produced a decrease of both CSSERP amplitudes and subjective estimates of pain, the effects of the former compound being greater. In contrast, after administration of imipramine no change of CSSERP amplitudes could be detected, whereas the subjective estimate of pain intensity decreased significantly. This was accompanied by a significant decrease of arousal indicating that pain relief produced by acute administration of imipramine was primarily related to its sedation action. The analgesic properties of anpirtoline were demonstrated in man. Tramadol was characterized as a week opioid analgesic. In contrast, imipramine appeared to produce its pain-relieving effects predominantly by non-specific actions. It is hypothesized that different analgesics may change ERP sources in a drug-specific manner.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8018453/

In experimental animals, these drugs activate limbic structures, such as the amygdala, that may coordinately regulate sensory processing, mood and pituitary hormone secretion during stress. Clinically relevant i.v. doses of the short-acting local anesthetic procaine were administered to 17 healthy volunteers and topographic electroencephalographic (EEG) spectra, stress-responsive neuroendocrine and cardiovascular parameters and sensory-cognitive and mood changes were examined. Because corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mimics the behavioral and physiologic responses to stress and activates limbic structures in experimental animals, the effects of procaine and lidocaine on immunoreactive CRH release from rat hypothalami in vitro were also explored. Procaine administration produced a dose-related increase in fast (21-50 Hz) EEG activity, a significant decrease in alpha EEG activity and dose-dependent increases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol and prolactin secretion. Dose-dependent increases in sensory distortions involved virtually all modalities, particularly auditory, visual and somatosensory. Mood changes occurred in most subjects, including anxiety, euphoria and arousal. In vitro, procaine and lidocaine both produced significant dose-related increases in immunoreactive CRH release from rat hypothalami, maximal at 10(-6) M, that were blocked by carbamazepine, a limbic anticonvulsant used in the management of mood disorders. The electrophysiologic effects of procaine in these volunteers were analogous to local anesthetic effects in experimental animals and consistent with the activation of subcortical structures localized within the temporal lobe, such as the amygdala. The effects of procaine on stress-responsive neurohormones were similar to those of amygdala stimulation both in experimental animals and human subjects. The in vitro data suggested that procaine-induced pituitary-adrenal activation involves stimulation of hypothalamic CRH, although additional (e.g., limbic-hypothalamic) mechanisms may contribute in vivo. These data were compatible with a direct action of local anesthetics on limbic structures that might account for many of the central effects seen with the systemic use of these agents in clinical practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8138967/

Our purpose was to determine whether the non-linear properties of the electroencephalogram (EEG) as defined by the bispectral index was a better predictor of autonomic responses to endotracheal intubation during opioid-based anesthesia than the linear statistical properties of the EEG formulated by power spectral analysis. Thirty-nine adults scheduled for elective non-cranial surgery had a continuous EEG recorded during induction of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia consisted of thiopental and nitrous oxide in oxygen, followed by 1 of 5 randomized opioid dose regimens. The EEG was continuously recorded and blood pressure was measured every minute. All electroencephalographic parameters were derived for the 3 min before and after intubation and were compared to the blood pressure and heart rate responses. Responders were defined by 2 analyses: patients who had a 20% or greater increase (1) in blood pressure or (2) in heart rate to laryngoscopy. Responders and non-responders were compared using Student's unpaired t test, and differences due to dose regimens were examined with logistic regression. Based on the criterion for blood pressure change, there were 27 responders and 12 non-responders. Heart rate changes did not differentiate between the two groups. There was a significant difference between response groups as measured by the bispectral index which distinguished responders from non-responders independently of the amount of drug given. None of the variables of power spectral analysis accurately distinguished responder from non-responder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7511501/

Patients were allocated to receive propofol by one of nine different manually-controlled infusion schemes designed to achieve and maintain a stable blood propofol concentration between 1.0 and 6.0 micrograms ml-1, covering a range of states between conscious sedation and full anaesthesia. We recorded the changes in MPF and the response to clinical signs of loss of consciousness at these different doses and concentrations of propofol. Using probit analysis, we derived MPF values corresponding to 50% and 95% suppression of response to verbal (9.3 Hz and 6.8 Hz), eyelash (8.9 Hz and 6.7 Hz) and venepuncture (5.7 Hz and 3.0 Hz) stimuli. Likewise, we obtained dose and concentration requirements for propofol to suppress these stimuli. The mean (95% confidence intervals) ED50 (5.8 (3.5-6.8) mg kg-1 h-1) and ED95 (8.3 (7.1-16.9) mg kg-1 h-1) propofol doses for suppression of consciousness were similar to the values for suppression of the eyelash reflex (6.2 (5.3-6.8) mg kg-1 h-1 and 8.6 (7.8-10.8) mg kg-1 h-1, respectively). The EC50 for loss of consciousness was a propofol concentration of 2.3 (1.8-2.7) micrograms ml-1 and for 50% suppression of MPF was 3.1 (2.7-3.5) micrograms ml-1.

7914688,Gamma-hydroxybutyrate: an overview of the pros and cons for it being a neurotransmitter and/or a useful therapeutic agent.,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,1994,Cash CD,"Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a catabolite in brain of gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and is also found in nonneuronal tissues. It is present in the brain at about one thousandth of the concentration of its parent compound. High affinity and specific uptake, and energy dependent transport systems for GHB have been described in brain in addition to a class of high affinity binding sites, functional at a rather unphysiologically low pH. Administration of large doses of GHB to animals and man leads to sedation, and at the highest doses, anaesthesia. These effects are prominent when GHB brain levels are over one hundred-fold the endogenous levels. In some animals, GHB administration also induces an electroencephalographic and behavioural changes resembling that of human petit mal epilepsy. GHB has been used in man as an anaesthetic adjuvant. GHB lowers cerebral energy requirements and may play a neuroprotective role. Administered GHB profoundly effects the cerebral dopaminergic system by a mechanism which remains to be unravelled. GHB has been tested with success on alcoholic patients where it attenuates the withdrawal syndrome. It is indicated here that in this situation, it may owe its effect by acting as a pro-drug of the neurotransmitter GABA into which it can be transformed. As administration of GHB, a GABAB receptor agonist and a natural opioid peptide all elicit similar abnormal EEG phenomena, it may be suggested that they are acting via a common pathway. The petit mal epileptic effects of GHB might be ascribed to its direct, or indirect agonist properties after transformation to a pool of GABA at the GABAB receptor or via interactions at its own binding sites linked to a similar series of biochemical events. Some anticonvulsant drugs, the opiate antagonist naloxone and a synthetic structural GHB analogue antagonise certain behavioural effects of GHB administration. It is postulated that GHB exerts some of its effects via transformation to GABA pools, and that substances which inhibit this process antagonise its effects by blocking GABA formation. GHB has been proposed as a neurotransmitter, although straightforward evidence for this role is lacking. Evidence for and against GHB, as a neurotransmitter, is reviewed here together with a discussion of its potential as a therapeutically useful drug.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7914688/

Supplementum,1994,Hindmarch I,"The basic assumption underlying psychopharmacology is that the effects of psychoactive drugs can be assessed by measuring the changes produced on aspects of human behaviour and cognitive function. This review concentrates on 3 established psychometric tests that have been shown over a long period of time to be not only valid and reliable measures of aspects of behaviour relevant to the daily activities of patients taking such drugs but also appropriate indicators of any countertherapeutic effects or side effects of medication. Choice reaction time (CRT) is a reliable index of sedation directly related to accident risk situations at home, on the road or at work. Critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT), a direct measure of the capacity for processing cognitive information, is an accurate measure of various aspects of mental illness and drug effects, and the continuous daytime EEG (c-EEG) is a truly objective measure of CNS activity on a continuous 24-h basis. The judicious use of CRT, CFFT, CFFT and c-EEG not only demonstrates the inherent potential of certain molecules to adversely affect the performance of certain daily activities but also helps identify the drugs with profiles of activity or side effects that are likely to be countertherapeutic.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7914048/

Thiopentone was administered i.v. in an initial dose of 2 mg kg-1, followed by repeated doses (1 mg kg-1 every 3 min) until the appearance of burst suppression on the EEG. The total dose administered was mean 10.7 (SD 2.6) mg kg-1. The magnetic coil was placed over the MEP scalp stimulation region and evoked electromyographic responses were recorded from the contralateral abductor pollicis brevis. After an initial dose of thiopentone, reproducible MEP responses were recorded in all patients, but amplitudes were reduced to 42.8% of baseline values. Further administration of repeated doses of thiopentone produced a dose-dependent decrease in success rate of MEP recordings and a significant reduction in MEP amplitude (P < 0.01). Latency did not change significantly, although there was a tendency to increase. During burst suppression on the EEG, MEP was not recorded successfully in all patients. We conclude that MEP recording during the administration of thiopentone is feasible only at a minimum dose, with a marked reduction in MEP amplitude.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8280552/

Cardiovascular, electromyogram (EMG), motor activity, and electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters were assessed before and after smoking a cigarette or drinking a cup of coffee. The same variables were averaged for 5-s periods preceding, during, and following the first six puffs and sips. As the expected psychophysiological changes might be related to pleasure, the experimental design included both pleasant-tasting coffee and cigarettes and preparations manipulated to be unpleasant. Comparing pre/post consumption and pre/post puffing changes, heart rate increased as expected pre/post a cigarette but not pre/post puffing. On the other hand, there was no change in heart rate pre/post a cup of coffee but a transient increase pre/post sipping. The pre/post puffing and pre/post sipping changes in the EEG power distribution were similar for both drugs, occurred already in anticipation of puffing and sipping, and qualitatively suggested sedation as opposed to the pre/post cigarette arousing effects. These results might explain the observations of subjective tranquilizing effects during the consumption of a stimulant.

We studied the frequency of these excitatory effects and correlated movements with electroencephalographic (EEG) findings in 67 unpremedicated patients (mean age 66.1 yr, range 45-82 yr). Excitatory effects, including myoclonus, tremor, and dystonic posturing, occurred in 86.6% of patients receiving etomidate; 69.2% of the patient responses were myoclonic. Multiple spikes appeared on the EEG in 22.2% of the etomidate patients. The frequency of excitatory effects was 16.6% after thiopental, 12.5% after methohexital, and 5.5% after propofol. None of the patients receiving thiopental, methohexital, or propofol developed myoclonic or seizure activity. In most patients, the excitatory movements were coincident with the early slow phase of the EEG which corresponds to the beginning of deep anesthesia. We conclude that perhaps caution should be exercised when administering etomidate to patients with a history of seizures as the myoclonic activity is associated with seizure activity. The incidence of excitatory movements after administration of propofol is very low.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8214699/

Previous studies have shown that contralateral carotid artery occlusion and intracranial stenoses are associated with cerebral ischemia during carotid endarterectomy; however, the angiographic collateral flow patterns associated with cerebral ischemia have not been identified. This paper reports a retrospective study of 67 patients who underwent two- to four-vessel cerebral angiography followed by carotid endarterectomy with 16-channel EEG monitoring. The angiograms were reviewed for extracranial occlusive disease and collateral flow patterns, and the EEG recordings were analyzed for ischemic changes during carotid artery cross-clamping. Statistical analysis was by Fisher's exact test. Cross-filling of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries from the contralateral carotid artery through the anterior communicating artery correlated with a decreased incidence of EEG ischemic changes. Only 21% of patients with this collateral flow pattern showed ischemic changes compared to 50% of patients without this pattern (p < 0.03). Three angiographic findings occurring in combination on the side contralateral to surgery correlated with EEG ischemia: 1) occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery (five of seven or 71%, p < 0.03); 2) collateral flow from the external carotid circulation to the internal carotid circulation via the ophthalmic artery; and 3) collateral flow from the posterior circulation to the contralateral anterior circulation via the posterior communicating artery. The data presented here corroborate the correlation between contralateral carotid artery occlusion and cerebral ischemia during carotid endarterectomy. They also demonstrate that cross-filling of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries by the contralateral carotid artery protects against such ischemia. This collateral flow may serve as an indicator of tolerance to carotid artery cross-clamping.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8360734/

Prospective laboratory evaluation.
The Thermoregulation Research Laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco.
6 healthy female volunteers aged 30 +/- 8 years.
Epidural anesthesia (approximately T10 dermatome) was induced and maintained using 2-chloroprocaine anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced by inhalation of nitrous oxide and enflurane and maintained with enflurane at an end-tidal concentration of 1.7%. A minimum of 2 degrees C core hyperthermia was induced by active cutaneous warming, and the volunteers subsequently were passively cooled.
EEG data were recorded from gold cup electrodes positioned at FP1 and FP2, with the reference electrode at CZ and the ground lead on the mastoid. In addition to routine EEG parameters, we evaluated the bispectral index. Bispectral analysis quantifies the phase coupling between various frequencies in the power spectrum and may be a useful measure of anesthetic depth. Core temperature was measured at the left tympanic membrane and distal esophagus. Core temperature also was determined from the right ear using two new, infrared tympanic membrane thermometers. One of these directly measures tympanic temperature, and the other extrapolates core temperature from the external ear canal. Induction of 2 degrees C core hyperthermia did not produce statistically significant or clinically important changes in beta or delta power, the 95% spectral edge frequency, or the bispectral index. Temperatures recorded from the right ear by the direct thermometer were 0.27 degrees C +/- 0.33 degrees C less than those measured in the left ear, but the values correlated well (r2 = 0.95 +/- 0.04). Temperatures recorded from the right ear by the core temperature extrapolater were 0.42 degrees C +/- 0.33 degrees C lower than those measured in the left ear, and the correlation between values was slightly worse (r2 = 0.83 +/- 0.16).
Since mild core hyperthermia does not alter routine EEG parameters or the bispectral index, typical perianesthetic thermal disturbances are unlikely to obscure EEG estimates of anesthetic depth. Both the direct thermometer and the core temperature extrapolater were found to be sufficiently accurate and precise for routine clinical use, but the direct thermometer would be preferable in the perioperative period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8217181/

The dose needed to reach maximum conscious sedation averaged 0.10 mg kg-1, ranging from 0.06 to 0.13 mg kg-1. 4. Sigmoidal concentration-effect relationships were found for EEG beta-amplitudes in five of six subjects, with average EC50 values (+/- s.d.) of 120 +/- 54 ng ml-1 for FFT and 104 +/- 40 ng ml-1 for AP. For the 'total number of waves' in the beta frequency range (AP) an average (n = 6) EC50 of 63 +/- 37 ng ml-1 was found. Changes in EEG alpha-amplitudes were found in three subjects, resulting in an average EC50 value of 55 +/- 32 ng ml-1. 5. For saccadic peak velocity (PV) concentration-effect relationships were linear in five subjects and sigmoidal in one. The maximal measured decrease in PV averaged -44 +/- 9%. 6. The differences in concentration-effect relationships for various effect parameters call for further studies with emphasis on the external validity and reproducibility of data. In such studies the dose needed to reach wake-sleep transition may be used as a relevant clinical end-point.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8398578/
8123394,Respiratory sinus arrhythmia: an index of light anaesthesia.,British journal of anaesthesia,1993,"Pomfrett CJ, Barrie JR, Healy TE","This study was designed to test if changes in the degree of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) can be used as an index of light anaesthesia. An on-line, real-time data logging system was used to record simultaneously the EEG and ECG waveforms from 10 patients undergoing routine surgery using i.v. propofol (Diprivan) anaesthesia. The degree of RSA was determined in real-time. The median frequency of the EEG was derived off-line and correlated with the degree of RSA. Time series analysis was performed on the derived indices off-line. Significant changes in the degree of RSA occurred in response to changes in propofol infusion in all patients; these changes corresponded also to changes in the median frequency of the EEG. Heart rate and ventilatory frequency are measured routinely during surgery and it is suggested that on-line monitoring of RSA, derived from these standard signals, provides a more convenient and objective index of lightening anaesthesia than either EEG analysis or classical estimates of anaesthetic depth based on arterial pressure or heart rate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8123394/
8345370,"Electroencephalogram spectral edge frequency, lower esophageal contractility, and autonomic responsiveness during general anesthesia.",Journal of clinical monitoring,1993,"Ghouri AF, Monk TG, White PF","Both the electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral edge frequency (SEF) and lower esophageal contractility (LEC) indices have been reported to be useful indicators of anesthetic depth. We designed a prospective study to evaluate the relationship between changes in these two variables and objective measurements of physiologic responsiveness to surgical stress (i.e., changes in hemodynamic variables and plasma levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, total catecholamines, and vasopressin). Eighty-nine consenting adult males undergoing radical prostatectomy procedures under a standardized general anesthetic technique were studied according to a randomized, single-blinded protocol. General anesthesia was induced with 30 micrograms/kg intravenous (i.v.) alfentanil, 2.5 mg/kg i.v. thiopental, and 0.1 mg/kg i.v. vecuronium, and subsequently maintained with 0.5 microgram/kg/min alfentanil, nitrous oxide (N2O) 67% in oxygen, and 0.8 microgram/kg/min vecuronium. Following retropubic dissection, 81 patients (92%) manifested acute hypertensive responses, with mean arterial pressure increasing from 90 +/- 14 to 122 +/- 14 mm Hg (mean +/- SD). This acute hypertensive response was treated with one of three different treatment modalities (20 to 60 micrograms/kg i.v. alfentanil, 0.5 to 2.0% inspired isoflurane, or 0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg i.v. trimethaphan) to return the mean arterial pressure to within 10% of the preincisional (baseline) value within 5 to 10 minutes. Although the mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and plasma levels of catecholamines and vasopressin significantly increased following the surgical stimulus, and decreased after adjunctive therapy, the EEG-SEF and LEC index (LECI) values did not significantly change during these study intervals. Furthermore, using a logistic regression analysis, we observed that preincision EEG-SEF and LECI values could not predict whether patients would manifest a hypertensive response. Therefore, the EEG-SEF and LECI were unreliable indicators of anesthetic depth.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8345370/
8487070,Computer-derived density spectral array in detection of mild analog electroencephalographic ischemic pattern changes during carotid endarterectomy.,Journal of neurosurgery,1993,"Kearse LA, Martin D, McPeck K, Lopez-Bresnahan M","The purpose of this prospective study was twofold: 1) to determine the sensitivity and specificity of computer-derived density spectral array in detecting analog electroencephalographic (EEG) ischemic pattern changes during carotid artery cross-clamping in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy; and 2) to assess the ability of density spectral array to identify such changes in comparison with the degree and type of change seen in the analog EEG ischemic pattern. Sixteen channels of anteroposterior bipolar and two to four channels of referential electroencephalography with four channels of density spectral array were monitored simultaneously during carotid endarterectomy in 103 patients under general anesthesia. Two ""observers"" interpreted the density spectral array and the analog electroencephalograms, one during and immediately after the operations and the other 6 months after completion of all surgery. Analyses were conducted to establish both the number of patients with analog EEG ischemic changes and the number of ischemia events during carotid artery cross-clamping. Observer A indicated that the density spectral array identified analog EEG ischemic changes in 21 of 29 patients, for a sensitivity of 72% (specificity 99%), whereas Observer B's results showed that the density spectral array identified analog EEG ischemic changes in 16 of 27 patients, for a sensitivity of 59% (specificity 96%). Density spectral array detection of analog EEG ischemic changes based on severity classifications were 61% and 18% in the mild group, 70% and 71% in the moderate group, and 95% in the severe group, indicating a relationship between density spectral array sensitivity and severity of analog EEG ischemic change, with p = 0.02 and p = 0.004 for the two observers. The kappa statistics for observer reproducibility were highly significant, with k = 0.95 for analog EEG ischemic changes and 0.85 for density spectral array changes. It is concluded that density spectral array does not reliably detect mild analog EEG pattern changes of cerebral ischemia and is not a reliable substitute for 16-channel analog EEG monitoring of cerebral ischemia during carotid endarterectomy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8487070/
8322985,The effects of midazolam on the EEG during sedation of critically ill patients.,Anaesthesia,1993,"Veselis RA, Reinsel R, Marino P, Sommer S, Carlon GC","Patients who require mechanical ventilation are often sedated with midazolam. As clinical signs of sedation are often confusing or nonexistent, and there are few adverse side effects when large doses are infused over a period of days, substantial drug accumulation can result in these critically ill patients, despite the short half-life of midazolam. An objective monitor of sedation would help maintain sedation at a constant level despite changing pharmacokinetic values in patients. We undertook this study to describe the electroencephalographic changes which occur with intravenous midazolam in critically ill patients, and to determine if a relationship exists between these changes and the depth of sedation as measured using a clinical scoring method. A series of 31 critically ill patients who required intravenous midazolam during mechanical ventilation were studied. Four different levels of sedation were defined ranging from execution of verbal commands to no response to suctioning through the tracheal tube or sternal rub. Electroencephalographic recordings were obtained in patients on a daily basis and a concurrent sedation level was determined. High frequency electroencephalogram activity decreased as sedation level increased. This was reflected in decreases in the spectral edge (17.61 to 10.56 Hz (p = 0.0024)), the median frequency (4.27 to 2.56 Hz (p = 0.0278)), and the logarithm of the absolute power in the beta 1 (p = 0.0012), and beta 2 (p < 0.0001) bands. An incidental finding of asymmetry in power between right and left frontal electrodes was observed, with right-sided power being 9-18% greater (p < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8322985/
8258770,A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model for quantal responses with thiopental.,Journal of pharmacokinetics and biopharmaceutics,1993,"Shanks CA, Avram MJ, Krejcie TC, Henthorn TK, Gentry WB","The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model developed here characterizes the relationship between simulated plasma concentrations of thiopental and two dichotomous endpoints determined at induction of anesthesia: loss of voluntary motor power (clinical endpoint), and burst suppression of the electroencephalogram (EEG endpoint). The model incorporated data from two separate thiopental patient studies: a pharmacokinetic study with 21 males, and a pharmacodynamic study with 30 males. In the pharmacodynamic study, cumulative quantal dose-response curves for the clinical and EEG endpoints were developed from observations made during a constant-rate infusion of thiopental. Population mean parameters, derived from the bolus pharmacokinetic thiopental study, were used to simulate concentration-time data for the 150 mg.min-1 thiopental infusion rate used in the dose-response study. A single biophase model incorporating the two endpoints was generated, combining the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from the two groups. Estimates of the mean effective thiopental concentrations affecting 50% of the population (EC50S) for the clinical and EEG endpoints were 11.3 and 33.9 micrograms.ml-1, respectively. The half-time for equilibration between arterial thiopental and the effect compartment was 2.6 min. These results are in reasonable agreement with previously described quantal concentration-response data, and with pharmacodynamic models developed for graded EEG responses. Simulation of bolus doses of thiopental with the new model provided ED50s for the clinical and EEG endpoints of 265 mg and 796 mg, respectively; the dose predicted to produce loss of voluntary motor power in 90% of an adult male population was 403 mg. A model combining population pharmacokinetics with cumulative dose-response relationships could prove useful in predicting dosage regimens for those drugs with responses that are categorical.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8258770/

EEG data for aperiodic analysis were collected during three 5-min periods: before propofol, during propofol infusion, and 30 min after termination of the infusion. After an initial dose of 1 mg/kg, subjects received a propofol infusion titrated to produce a standard level of conscious sedation. The infusion rate was 84 +/- 27 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1 (mean +/- SE) and plasma propofol levels were 2180 +/- 43 ng/mL. Total EEG power, defined as the sum of the squares of peak-to-peak amplitudes during each 5-s epoch, increased from 1350 +/- 295 microV2 x epoch-1 to 9675 +/- 2390 microV2 x epoch-1 during the propofol infusion (P < 0.05); it returned to 1445 +/- 145 microV2 x epoch-1 30 min after the infusion was discontinued (P < 0.05 vs the result during propofol). The change in total power was accompanied by a change in the distribution of power within the EEG spectrum, as the fraction of activity in the beta-band (12-35 Hz) increased during the infusion from 23% +/- 3% to 44% +/- 5% (P < 0.05). Thirty minutes after the infusion was terminated, the distribution of activity within the EEG spectrum had reverted to pre-propofol patterns. The similarity of EEG effects seen with sedative doses of propofol and benzodiazepines suggests that these drugs may share some neurochemical effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8484554/

We chose a median EEG frequency of 2-4 Hz as the EEG set point. The slope of the asymptote to the cumulative dose requirement was used to define an effective therapeutic infusion of alfentanil. Median EEG frequency (mean (SD)) during the feedback period was 3.03 (0.45) Hz. The average effective therapeutic infusion of alfentanil was 0.140 (0.032) mg min-1.

The method of FFT approximation was used for this purpose. It allows the calculation of center of gravity equivalent dipoles of spectral EEG data. The results are reference independent and allow therefore a more unambiguous interpretation compared to conventional FFT data reports. Twelve subjects were investigated before and after 0.1 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg midazolam respectively, directly and 4 h after administration of 1 mg flumazenil. Our results imply that the application of flumazenil after midazolam sedation leads to an almost complete restoration of the brain electrical activity. However, especially in the beta frequencies above 20 Hz differences in depth of equivalent dipoles were found directly after flumazenil application as well as 4 h later. This could suggest that neuronal generators in different brain structures were responsible for the electrical activity after flumazenil administration compared to before.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7682925/

In spite of improvements in surgical technique, this operation is still associated with significant perioperative complications (5-13%) which are frequently (up to 40%) correlated with intolerance to internal carotid artery clamping. For this reason, intraoperative cerebral monitoring able to accurately detect ischaemia during surgery would be useful. Reviewing our experience from the last 7 years in 74 patients operated on for stenosis and contralateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery, we found a 1.3% neurological morbidity and 1.3% mortality rate. Presenting symptoms included focal transient ischaemia attacks (TIAs) in 57 patients, stroke in 16 patients and two patients were asymptomatic. Half of these patients (37) were operated on under general anaesthesia with electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, stump pressure measurement and selective shunting. In this group, two patients (5.4%) sustained a postoperative stroke, one of which was fatal. The remaining 37 patients were operated on under local-regional anaesthesia with selective shunting on the basis of neurological deficit onset or loss of consciousness during the test clamp. There were no postoperative neurological complications in this group but one patient died of acute myocardial infarction on the 6th postoperative day. This experience suggests that it is possible to perform carotid endarterectomy in patients with severe bilateral lesions with a postoperative complication rate similar to that in patients with less complicated obstructive lesions if accurate intraoperative cerebral monitoring is used.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8458443/

Thirty-seven babies were treated with phenobarbitone, 18 received morphine and 22 babies received no regular sedation. A ""burst"" was defined as a discharge of integrated amplitude greater than 10 microV and maximum interburst intervals in 10-min epochs over a 2-h period were measured. Maximum interburst was prolonged in babies given either morphine or phenobarbitone for sedation. Administration of a single dose of diazepam for intubation had a marked additive effect on the EEG depression caused by the base sedative and prolonged the effect for 11 to 12 h after drug administration. We conclude that the effect of sedative drugs must therefore be accounted for when interpreting records of quantified EEG for 12 to 24 h after drug administration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8453218/

Clinical study. Anesthesiologist was blinded in the evaluation of post-electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) myalgia and other side effects.
University-affiliated veterans general hospital.
Two groups of twelve psychiatric inpatients who suffered from major depression or catatonic-type schizophrenia that failed to respond to tricyclic antidepressant therapy.
Under single-channel, prefrontal electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, patients were given either 0.3 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg of atracurium intravenously (IV) after anesthetic induction with methohexital 1 mg/kg i.v.
Evoked electromyographic responses of the adductor pollicis muscle was obtained by train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist every 20 seconds. The first twitch depression (T1) of neuromuscular blockade was maintained within 11% to 25% (atracurium 0.3 mg/kg) or 0% to 10% (atracurium 0.5 mg/kg) of control during the entire session of MMECT. Patients pretreated with atracurium 0.5 mg/kg had significantly fewer ECT-induced moderate and vigorous convulsions when compared with patients receiving atracurium 0.3 mg/kg (16.7% vs. 78.4%, moderate; 0% vs. 8.3%, vigorous). However, patients pretreated with atracurium 0.5 mg/kg took a longer time to attain a T4 ratio of 0.5 than did patients receiving atracurium 0.3 mg/kg (9.2 +/- 0.8 minutes vs. 4.3 +/- 0.4 minutes). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to cumulative seizure duration or frequency of bradycardia, sialorrhea, postseizure myalgia, nausea, headache, or confusion. No patient in either group recalled any event concerning electroconvulsive shock.
Whereas full neuromuscular blockade by atracurium 0.5 mg/kg i.v. is very effective in the modification of tonic-clonic convulsions induced by ECT, we suggest that a lower dose of atracurium (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) be used if one needs to ascertain the occurrence of ECT-induced seizures as indicated by minimum peripheral muscle activity at the time of EEG recording during MMECT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8442962/

During surgery, isoflurane in air and oxygen (FIO2 0.35), or isoflurane in 65% nitrous oxide in oxygen were given to each patient for 30 min, in random order. EEG was recorded and digitized off-line. The proportion of EEG suppression time was measured after a washin or washout period of at least 15 min for nitrous oxide. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of EEG suppression time (from 69.5 to 43.7%) when air was replaced by nitrous oxide.

We studied the association of the patient characteristics age, gender, weight, lean body mass, and cardiac output with thiopental requirements. Doses of thiopental, infused at 150 mg/min, required to reach both a clinical end-point and an electroencephalographic (EEG) end-point were determined in 30 males and 30 females, aged 18-83 yr. Univariate least squares linear regression analysis revealed outliers in the relationships of age, weight, lean body mass, and cardiac output to thiopental dose at clinical and EEG endpoints. Differential weighting of data points minimized the effect of outliers in the construction of a robust multiple linear regression model of the relationship between several selected independent variables and the dependent variables thiopental dose at clinical and EEG endpoints. The multiple linear regression model for thiopental dose at the clinical end-point selecting the regressor variables age, weight, and gender (R2 = 0.76) was similar to that for age, lean body mass, and gender (R2 = 0.75). Thiopental dose at the EEG endpoint was better described by models selecting the variables age, weight, and cardiac output (R2 = 0.88) or age, lean body mass, and cardiac output (R2 = 0.87).

Such a simplification of the EEG is desirable because a univariate quantity can be modeled using standard nonlinear regression techniques, and because most of the information in the EEG is redundant or unrelated to drug concentration. In previous studies of the EEG response to opioids, the manner in which a univariate component was extracted from the EEG was ad hoc. In this paper, this extraction was performed optimally using a new statistical technique, semilinear canonical correlation. Data from 15 patients who received an intravenous infusion of the semisynthetic opioid alfentanil were analyzed. The components of the EEG that were nearly maximally correlated with plasma drug concentration were found, based on a standard pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. Two new EEG components were produced from the powers in the frequency spectrum of the EEG: a weighted sum of the logarithms of the powers, and a weighted sum of the powers expressed as percentages of the total power.

General anaesthesia is a state of analgesia and impaired cognitive function that results from the depressant effects of anaesthetics. 2.

It may be very difficult, particularly in patients with neuromuscular blockade, to identify a change in state which results in conscious awareness. 5. A range of methods has been used for evaluating depth of anaesthesia. 6. The evidence reviewed in this paper suggests that the median frequency in the EEG and the auditory evoked potential appear to be the best techniques for monitoring the graded effects of anaesthetics on the brain. 7. The median frequency, which is 10 Hz in conscious subjects, should be kept below 5 Hz during anaesthesia to ensure that there is no response to verbal command. 8. The auditory evoked potential measures the resulting effects of anaesthetic depression and surgical stimulation which is ""depth of anaesthesia"". 9.

The level of anesthesia was kept constant beginning 10 min before and until 44 min after epidural injection. EEG power spectral analysis was performed throughout the study period using a 2-min average of 8-9-s epochs. Clonidine significantly reduced EEG total power only after epidural administration (P less than 0.05). Relative power increased in the delta band in both the epidural and iv clonidine groups (P less than 0.001). The depression of the total EEG power after epidural injection could be explained neither by systemic absorption alone nor by hemodynamic variations. It may represent the contribution of the direct spinal action of this alpha 2-adrenergic agonist to general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1519783/
1409867,Quantitative topographical analysis of effects of single thiopental bolus on human electroencephalogram.,Pharmacopsychiatry,1992,"Dierks T, Kullmann F, Engelhardt W, Maurer K","The aim of present study was to characterize the topographical effect of thiopental on the EEG during induction of anesthesia. A multichannel (19 channels) digital EEG was recorded in 10 patients undergoing surgical treatment. The period during induction of anaesthesia before intubation was investigated in regard to peak frequency, amplitude, topography, and amplitude in conventional frequency bands. The main findings were a slowing of the EEG with a simultaneous increase of amplitude in the predominant EEG frequency (peak frequency) during induction. The topographical analysis showed a clear change of localization of the peak frequency in the occipito-frontal direction. Berger described the effect of thiopental on electrical cortical activity as early as 1933. Since then, many studies have investigated its influence on the EEG, but few have tried to characterize the effects of topographical changes in a quantitative way.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1409867/

Ten healthy volunteers underwent EEG monitoring (at Fz, Cz, Pz and Oz electrode sites) before, during and after propofol 0.5 mg kg-1 i.v. bolus and 75 micrograms kg-1 min-1 as an infusion. Mean serum concentration of propofol during infusion was 0.86 (SD 0.14) micrograms ml-1. The EEG changed significantly during infusion, with increased power in the beta 1 (15-20 Hz), beta 2 (20.5-30 Hz) and delta (1-3.5 Hz) frequencies. Beta 1 and beta 2 power changes were most marked at the Fz and Cz electrodes. Subjects were sedated, but able to complete cognitive tasks. Visual analogue scales of attention and sleepiness were obtained throughout the study and demonstrated a sedative effect during propofol infusion, but were not a significant factor in memory performance or EEG changes. A verbal learning task (Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Task) administered before, during and after infusion showed a marked reduction in short-term memory capacity and dramatically impaired free recall and recognition during infusion. Nine of 10 subjects had partial amnesia for complex visual scenes presented during infusion, recalling less than 50% of the material. Stronger cueing was required to retrieve information presented during propofol infusion, with an increase in mean retrieval time from 95.4 (41.2) s to 426.8 (83.1) s.

They were all male with a mean age of 65.8 years (range, 46-85) and a mean weight of 76.2 kg (range, 50-109). Patients received no premedication. All drugs were administered as a single i.v. bolus. After baseline EEG recordings were obtained, i.v. bolus doses were given and the recording continued until the patients became fully responsive to verbal commands. The EEGs were visually analyzed and classified into 4 phases: phase 0, the wake physiologic pattern; phase 1, initial changes after i.v. bolus doses; phase 2, state of deep anesthesia; and phase 3, stage of recovery. The main change during phase 1 was increase in the amplitude of the background rhythms. Phase 2 was characterized by theta and delta activity and burst suppression in some patients. During phase 3 beta activity was seen following methohexital. Propofol produced a much deeper level of anesthesia compared to methohexital. The stage of deep anesthesia was prolonged following propofol. The clinical and EEG recoveries were prolonged after induction doses of propofol. The quality of recovery, however, was far superior with propofol. Methohexital produces a ""hang over"" effect which delays full recovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1378382/

Twenty-six ASA physical status 1 or 2 patients participated in the study. Two constant serum thiopental concentrations were maintained in each patient using a computer-controlled infusion pump. The first randomly assigned target serum concentration of 10-30 micrograms/ml was maintained for 5 min to allow serum:brain equilibration. Then the following stimuli were applied at 1-min intervals: verbal command, tetanic nerve stimulation, trapezius muscle squeeze, and laryngoscopy. A second, higher, randomly assigned target serum concentration of 40-90 micrograms/ml was then achieved and maintained by the computer-controlled infusion pump. The previously described stimuli were reapplied, after which laryngoscopy and intubation was performed. A positive response was recorded if purposeful extremity movement or coughing was observed. Using the quantal movement or cough response and the measured constant serum thiopental concentration, the probability of no movement to each stimulus was characterized using logistic regression. The serum thiopental concentrations that produced a 50% probability of no movement response for the clinical stimuli were as follows: 15.6 micrograms/ml for verbal command, 30.3 micrograms/ml for tetanic nerve stimulation, 39.8 micrograms/ml for trapezius muscle squeeze, 50.7 micrograms/ml for laryngoscopy, and 78.8 micrograms/ml for laryngoscopy followed by intubation. The EEG was analyzed using aperiodic waveform analysis to derive the number of waves per second.

The goal of this investigation was to use a computer-controlled infusion pump (CCIP) to obtain constant serum thiopental concentrations and use the electroencephalogram (EEG) as a measure of thiopental's central nervous system drug effect. The number of waves per second obtained from aperiodic waveform analysis was used as the EEG measure. A CCIP was used in six male volunteers to attain rapidly and then maintain for 6-min time periods the following pseudo-steady-state constant serum thiopental target concentrations: 10, 20, 30, and 40 micrograms/ml. The median performance error (bias) of the CCIP using 149 measurements of thiopental serum concentrations in six subjects was +5%, and the median absolute performance error (accuracy) was 16%. Following the step change in serum thiopental concentration, the EEG number of waves per second stabilized within 2-3 min and the remained constant until the target serum thiopental concentration was changed. When the constant serum thiopental concentration was plotted against the number of waves per second for each subject, a biphasic serum concentration versus EEG effect relationship was seen. This biphasic concentration:response relationship was characterized with a nonparametric pharmacodynamic model. The awake, baseline EEG was 10.6 waves/s; at peak activation the EEG was 19.1 waves/s and occurred at a serum thiopental concentration of 13.3 micrograms/ml. At a serum thiopental concentration of 31.2 micrograms/ml the EEG had slowed to 10.6 waves/s (back to baseline) and at 41.2 micrograms/ml was 50% below the baseline, awake value. Zero waves per second occurred at serum thiopental concentrations greater than 50 micrograms/ml.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether fentanyl is capable of evoking electrical seizure activity in patients with complex partial (temporal lobe) seizures. Nine patients were studied in whom recording electrode arrays had been placed in the bitemporal epidural space several days earlier to determine which temporal lobe gave rise to their seizures. The symptomatic temporal lobe was localized by correlating clinical and electrical seizure activity obtained during continuous simultaneous videotape and epidural EEG monitoring. In each patient, clinical seizures and electrical seizure activity were consistently demonstrated to arise unilaterally from one temporal lobe (four on the right, five on the left). During fentanyl induction of anesthesia in preparation for secondary craniotomy for anterior temporal lobectomy, eight of the nine patients exhibited electrical seizure activity at fentanyl doses ranging from 17.7 to 35.71 micrograms.kg-1 (mean 25.75 micrograms.kg-1). More importantly, four of these eight seizures occurred initially in the ""healthy"" temporal lobe contralateral to the surgically resected lobe from which the clinical seizures had been shown to arise. These findings indicate that, in patients with complex partial seizures, moderate doses of fentanyl can evoke electrical seizure activity. The results of this study could have important implications for neurosurgical centers where electrocorticography is used during surgery for the purpose of determining the extent of the resection.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1625007/

Plasma diazepam levels, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and fraction of total electroencephalographic (EEG) amplitude falling in the sigma plus beta (13 to 31 Hz) frequency range were determined during the 12 hours after drug administration. Peak plasma diazepam concentration and area under the 12-hour curve were proportional to dose; time of peak was independent of dose. Baseline percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range averaged 15.7% and did not differ among the four trials. The percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range did not change over baseline with placebo or 2 mg diazepam but was increased 1/4 to 2 1/2 hours after 5 mg diazepam, (maximum, +7.3%) and 3/4 to 12 hours after 10 mg diazepam (maximum, +15.2%). The increase in the percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range was highly correlated with plasma diazepam concentration. DSST scores for placebo and 2 mg diazepam were nearly identical. DSST decrements with 5 and 10 mg diazepam paralleled and were correlated with the changes in the percentage of EEG amplitude falling in the 13 to 31 Hz range and with plasma diazepam levels.

The effects of hypocarbia alone and of hypocarbia with sufentanil in patients receiving a N2/O2 (70%:30%) anesthetic were also studied. Hypocarbia alone caused changes in most EEG descriptors from both the anterior (F3-C3) and posterior (P3-O1) EEG montages. All EEG descriptors in both hypocarbic and normocarbic patients significantly changed when sufentanil was administered, reflecting a shift of power into the lower frequency ranges. When the anterior EEG montages from the two groups that received sufentanil were compared, the delta power band, spectral edge 50 (median power frequency), and the relative power in the delta power band divided by the alpha plus beta power bands [D/(A + B)] in the hypocarbic group exhibited a significantly greater shift of power into the lower frequency range. It is concluded that (a) power spectral analysis is a sensitive measure of the effects of hypocarbia and small doses of sufentanil on the brain; (b) the power spectral analysis descriptors--delta power band, spectral edge 50, and [D/(A + B)]--are statistically the most sensitive to EEG changes induced by sufentanil; and (c) hypocarbia intensifies patient EEG response to sufentanil, as judged by changes in EEG descriptors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1385931/

The sedative effects of midazolam and antagonism by flumazenil resulted in alterations in EEG, P300 and psychometric tests (syndrome short test, letter cancellation, choice reaction and recognition). However, 60 and 120 min after flumazenil a decrease in test performance indicating rebound sedation was seen only in P300 mapping. Thus P300 mapping was a sensitive method of detecting subtle differences in vigilance. Rebound sedation occurred even when midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1 was antagonized with an adequate dose of flumazenil. We suggest that it is advisable to supervise patients for at least 240 min after flumazenil antagonism of midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1637608/

A battery of tests was performed before and after four weeks treatment. Anxiety scores improved very significantly in both groups with no subjective sedation nor other particular side-effects noted in either group. However, lorazepam reduced the EEG averaged evoked response and produced significant impairment in the reaction time and memory tests whereas alpidem had no such effects.

Two different subgroups of tracings were analyzed: EEGs performed on therapeutically paralyzed (TP+) neonates and EEGs performed on non-therapeutically paralyzed (TP-) neonates. The rate of electrographic seizures, abnormal EEG background activity, and excessive sharp EEG transients (SETs) was significantly more common in the tracings performed on TP- neonates. In lethargic/comatose TP- neonates with clinically suspected seizures and abnormal EEG background activity, the rate of EEGs with excessive SETs (implying a ""lowered seizure threshold"") occurred equally in tracings with or without documented electrographic seizures. Consequently, we suspect that routine EEGs may be inadequate to electrographically confirm suspected seizures in some TP- neonates due to a large sampling error. In contrast, routine 40-minute EEGs are probably adequate to seek evidence of electrographic seizure activity in TP+ neonates because their seizure rate is low and most do not display background abnormalities or excessive SETs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1573242/

Although the effects of midazolam on the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of healthy volunteers have been reported previously, to our knowledge such effects in ill patients have not been documented. Herein we describe the effects of intravenously administered midazolam on the EEGs of eight seriously ill patients (age range, 49 to 80 years; mean, 69 years). The EEGs showed drug-induced relatively fast (alpha or beta) frequency activity superimposed on delta slowing in six patients and mild to moderate voltage attenuation in three patients. An alpha frequency coma pattern, a transient burst-suppression pattern, and a spindle coma pattern were also seen. Thus, the effects of intravenously administered midazolam on the EEGs of seriously ill patients are similar to those noted after the administration of other benzodiazepines.

Eight patients, 18-71 yr, with intracranial space-occupying lesions, were studied. In each patient ICP was monitored via a lateral ventriculostomy catheter placed preoperatively. In the operating room, an ECG, a radial arterial line, and a two-channel computerized EEG were placed. Control (awake) measurements of MAP (mmHg), ICP (mmHg), CPP (mmHg), heart rate (HR-bpm), EEG power (picowatts-pW), and spectral edge frequency (SEF, Hz) were obtained. Anaesthesia was induced with etomidate, 0.2 mg.kg-1 iv, followed immediately by an etomidate infusion, 20 mg.min-1, iv, and vecuronium 0.2 mg.kg-1 iv. When early burst suppression was achieved, the etomidate infusion was stopped and tracheal intubation performed. The etomidate dose (bolus plus infusion) required to reach burst suppression was 1.28 +/- 0.11 mg.kg-1. Compared with awake control values (mean +/- SE), the period from induction to burst suppression was associated with a 50% decrease in ICP (22 +/- 1 vs 11 +/- 1 mmHg, P less than 0.01), but there were no changes in MAP, CPP, or HR. The decrease in ICP was maintained during the first 30 sec and the following 60 sec after intubation as MAP and HR remained unchanged. Our results suggest that when etomidate was administered to early burst suppression pattern on EEG, minimal changes in CPP occurred during induction of anaesthesia and a marked reduction in ICP was maintained following tracheal intubation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1551154/

Hypotension is one of the main risks: preloading of the maternal circulation is used to prevent maternal hypotension and its consequences. For this, various colloid and crystalloid solutions are used. We report a case of maternal anaphylactoid reaction with apparent death in a neonate after dextran administration to the mother. After 100ml of a dextran 40 solution administered intravenously, immediately before an epidural blockade, the mother fainted and developed urticaria and mild respiratory disturbances, without hypotension. At that point dextran infusion was stopped. An apparently dead neonate was rapidly delivered. Immediate and vigorous cardiopulmonary resuscitation was successful. Clonismus appeared 12h later, followed by 3 general epileptic fits treated by phenytoin infusion and subsequently oral phenobarbital. No aetiology was found. After 2 months of treatment, barbiturates were stopped following clinical and electroencephalogram (EEG) improvement. Several similar cases of neonatal disorders resulting from preventive dextran administration during delivery were studied in a national pharmacovigilance survey in France. There were 32 cases reported with moderate maternal anaphylactoid reaction associated with severe acute fetal distress; it is probably advisable to take a cautious approach and avoid preventive fluid preload by dextran administration. Gelatins or crystalloid solutions should be preferred, with intravenous vasopressive amine administered promptly and repeated if necessary should significant maternal hypotension occur during epidural anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1371390/

There was considerable variation in subject response to the different doses, but adequate sedation was indicated by the presence of a strong alpha rhythm (9-11 Hz) and suppression of frequencies below 5 Hz. Overdose was indicated by an initial shift in the alpha frequency to a lower value (6-7 Hz) followed by the appearance of delta waves (0.5-4 Hz) and loss of alpha waves. In part two, 20 volunteers inhaled enflurane at 0.5% for 10 min to allow adequate absorption, followed by a 10-min recovery period. Equal numbers showed sedation or a failure to respond to enflurane at this concentration. In the responders, sedation was accompanied by a marked shift in the ratio of the power in two frequency bands: 1-4 Hz and 8-12 Hz.

The five descriptors (median frequency, spectral edge frequency-90%, total power, a frequency band power ratio, and the ratio of frontal to occipital power) were compared for their ability to predict imminent arousal. Arousal was defined as spontaneous movement, coughing or eye opening. All of the descriptors except the frontal-occipital power ratio underwent significant (P less than 0.05) changes between the initial recordings made intraoperatively during surgical stimulus under anesthesia and later recordings in the 40 s preceding arousal. A post hoc analysis was performed to identify the threshold value for each parameter that best served to predict imminent arousal. For median frequency, spectral edge frequency-90%, total power, and the frequency band power ratio, thresholds that predicted imminent arousal with sensitivities of 90% and specificities of 82-90% could be identified. The data indicate that, even in the favorable circumstances of the present study (uniform anesthetic technique, post hoC identification of thresholds), none of several previously popularized EEG descriptors (median frequency, spectral edge frequency-90%, total power, a frequency band power ratio) can serve as a completely reliable sole predictor of imminent arousal.

Pupillary responses were measured using a portable infrared pupillometer following 15 min dark adaptation, assessing resting vertical pupil diameter (RPD), light constricted diameter (MPD) and recovered final diameter (FPD) at the end of a 3 s measurement cycle. 3. Both doses of ICI 169,369 produced a mean 36% (range 10-54%) decrease in log 10 power of the waking EEG alpha activity with eyes closed (P less than 0.02), and mean 38% (range 2-86%) increase in theta activity at 2 h compared with placebo. 4. Both 80 and 120 mg doses of ICI 169,369 reduced RPD by approximately 30% from a predose value of 6.25 mm (+/- 0.87; 95% CI) and from placebo values 6.41 mm (+/- 1.06) and 7.48 mm (+/- 1.49) at 3 and 5 h after dosing. MPD was reduced by 50% with the 120 mg dose at 5 h after dosing (placebo 5.2 mm; ICI 169,369 2.7 mm; P less than 0.05). FPD was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) by both doses at 3 h after dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1958438/

Biomedical engineering,1991,"Bender R, Schultz B, Schultz A, Pichlmayr I","In EEG analysis an automatic pattern recognition is of interest. In this paper the usefulness of autoregressive parameters to classify EEG segments recorded during anesthesia is examined. Assuming that the AR parameters are multivariate normally distributed, parametric methods of discriminant analysis can be applied. The results show that AR parameters have high discriminating power and that the lowest error classification rate (smaller than 3%) is obtained by using quadratic discriminant functions. Consequently autoregressive parameters are efficient for classifying EEG segments into general stages of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1768768/

Twenty healthy volunteers were divided into two groups: Group I (n = 10) received 0.25 mg.kg-1 ketamine iv; Group II (n = 10) received 0.5 mg.kg-1 ketamine iv. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2), and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) were measured. The EEG was recorded from temporo-occipital recording sites over both hemispheres. Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery was measured using a transcranial Doppler ultrasound system. All variables were evaluated at baseline and for 60 min following ketamine. Administration of ketamine resulted in increases of MAP and HR in both groups to a similar degree. The PETCO2 and SaO2 did not change in either group over time. Ketamine caused a dose-dependent, transient shift in the EEG to synchronous high-voltage slow waves with an increase in total power (Group I: 301 +/- 38%; Group II: 104 +/- 28%). These changes were associated with dose-dependent increases in mean blood flow velocity (Group I: 35 +/- 7%; Group II: 68 +/- 10%). Our data suggest that increases in intracranial blood flow velocity are closely correlated to increases in neuronal activity and are not secondary to changes in systemic haemodynamic variables.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1742815/

The processed EEG patterns could not be precisely correlated with a standard clinical scoring system but were useful in determining the adequacy of sedation, particularly when a muscle relaxant was used. The monitor also shows considerable promise in the management of the paralysed patient with widespread convulsive activity in whom ischaemic brain damage may be occurring from epileptiform activity in the absence of any clinical manifestation.

Her ictal EEG pattern was characterized by regular 1.5-2.0 Hz sharp and slow wave complexes. A right craniotomy was performed under general anesthesia and intraoperative electroencephalographic and electrocorticographic recordings were obtained by means of scalp steel electrodes and modified cerebellar stimulation electrodes, respectively. These recordings demonstrated that surface spikes were often independent from the electrocorticographically recorded ones. Before tumor excision, electrical stimulation of the peritumoral mesial cortex resulted in an increase in the epileptic activity. The stimulation of the cavity left after tumor excision led to a prolonged electrographic seizure and neurophysiological procedures were stopped. Post-operatively, the patient has remained seizure free for 6 months and her EEG was normal.

Mean patient age and weight were 5.5 +/- 1.2 months and 4.9 +/- 0.3 kg, respectively. After core cooling on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), all patients received thiopental, 8 mg/kg, 5 minutes prior to circulatory arrest. Satisfactory EEG recordings were obtained for 9 patients, and serum thiopental concentration was measured in 12 patients. Hypothermia (mean venous return temperature, 17.8 degrees C +/- 1.6 degrees C) alone was associated with persistent cerebral electrical activity in 8 of 9 patients (89%). The addition of thiopental, 8 mg/kg, produced an isoelectric EEG in 6 of these 8 patients (75%). Mean circulatory arrest duration was 44 +/- 4 minutes. EEG activity resumed after reinstitution of CPB in all patients. Serum thiopental concentration at the end of CPB was negligible. It is concluded that hypothermia alone often may not produce EEG isoelectricity, and that the associated cerebral metabolic activity may be suppressed by adjunctive use of thiopental.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1873512/

Accordingly, simultaneous 16-channel continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring were performed in 64 normocapnic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and anesthetized with isoflurane or halothane-nitrous oxide (supplemented with fentanyl). Recordings were obtained before, during, and for 15 min after cross-clamping of the internal carotid artery. Internal shunt was not used in any patient, regardless of EEG and SSEP changes. Significant amplitude reduction in the cortical component of the primary negative peak (greater than 50%) in SSEP occurred in 6 patients, and an increase in central conduction time (CCT) (greater than 1 ms) occurred in 5 patients. Major EEG changes occurred in 6 patients, 4 of whom also had SSEP changes. Two patients had transient neurologic deficits postoperatively, with both having SSEP changes (amplitude reduction greater than 50%), whereas one had EEG changes. Based on these observations, the relative sensitivity and specificity for EEG and SSEP (amplitude reduction greater than 50%) in detecting postoperative neurologic deficits were 50% and 92% for EEG and 100% and 94% for SSEP, respectively, differences that were not statistically significant. Regarding SSEP, the use of latency change (CCT) as a criterion was associated with a sensitivity of 0% (P = 0.046 from sensitivity of amplitude) and a specificity of 87% (P = 0.17 from specificity of amplitude).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2064043/

We studied the effects of hypocapnia (PaCO2 approximately 23 mmHg) and hypercapnia (PaCO2 approximately 50 mmHg) during steady-state alfentanil/N2O anesthesia in 16 patients. EEG and PTN-SCEP were recorded continuously, while PaCO2 was altered in 15-min intervals by varying the inspired CO2 concentration. Hypocapnia caused significant increases in power in the delta, theta, and beta bands (P less than 0.01), with the greatest increase observed in the alpha band. Relative power increased in the alpha band but remained unchanged in the delta, theta, and beta bands. Median frequency and 95% spectral edge frequency were unaltered during hypocapnia. In contrast, hypercapnia caused a significant decrease of power in the alpha and beta bands, whereas delta and theta power remained unchanged. This was reflected in a significant decrease of the 95% spectral edge frequency, from 8.9 (6.7-11.6) to 7.0 (5.6-8.6) Hz. All EEG parameters returned to normal upon restoration of normocapnia. There was a significant negative correlation between power in the alpha band and end-tidal CO2 in all patients (r = 0.47 to -0.89). PTN-SCEP latencies and amplitudes were not significantly different from control values during hypocapnia and hypercapnia. It is concluded that variations in PaCO2 within the limits 20-50 mmHg produce substantial changes in the EEG power spectrum, especially in the alpha band (8-12 Hz), but do not alter PTN-SCEP.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1905885/

Clear visual changes in the EEG power spectrum can be present with little or no change in univariate variable values. A method that could produce a single value based on the total data available in the EEG power spectrum would be very useful in monitoring EEG changes. Neural network analysis is a technique that can take multiple inputs and produce a single output value using complicated processing patterns that require training to establish. We examined the usefulness of a series of neural network models to classify 63 EEG patterns against sedation level in 26 mechanically ventilated patients requiring midazolam for long-term sedation. During a stable period of sedation, a 4- to 60-minute period of EEG data was obtained concurrently with a sedation level from 1 (follows commands) to 7 (no or gag response to suctioning of the endotracheal tube). The EEG power spectrum was divided into equal frequency bands, and the log absolute powers in each of these bands were used as inputs for a series of neural network models. The output target was the sedation level associated with each set of EEG data. Networks were trained on a subset of EEG power/sedation score data pairs, and the ability to classify the remaining data pairs was tested. Using a t-test comparison with a random set of sedation levels, we found that trained neural network models classified EEG patterns against sedation level successfully (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1890449/

There were 167 intervals of profound hypotension ranging from 8 to 96 seconds. During these periods the cerebral perfusion pressure was almost zero. Despite 38 intervals up to 32 seconds long, 6 of the 15 patients had no EEG changes. Overall, there were 36 (21.6%) ischemic EEG recordings. None of the patients developed neurological complications. The incidence of EEG changes was much lower than expected from other studies.

The VEP was recorded with a standard EEG electrode from the midline parietal region in reference to both earlobes linked to the ground. An array of light-emitting-diodes mounted in opaque goggles was used to stimulate both eyes simultaneously and photic stimuli were delivered at random inter-pulse intervals with uniform distribution ranging from 2 to 5 seconds. Fifty trials of data were averaged to estimate that Pmax latency, i.e., the latent period from the photic stimulus to the maximum positive peak arising after 170 msec. Increases in the Pmax latency following the administration of anesthetics and restorations to preanesthetic values after recovery from anesthesia were found. A significant correlation was demonstrated between the Pmax latency and the inspiratory concentration of enflurane. The latency of the Pmax showed a drastic and a sensitive prolongation from about 200 msec in the awake state up to about 600 msec at the stage where the EEG exhibits large-voltage slow waves. Thus the measurement of the Pmax latency of VEPs was found to be useful for monitoring the depth of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1776909/

Data were collected at various times including the preinduction period, every minute during the infusion period (minute 0 to 14), and 15, 20 and 25 min after the start of the infusion (1, 6 and 11 min respectively after completion of the infusion). Within three minutes of the sufentanil infusion, the total power and the relative power of delta increased to near maximum, while the 95% spectral edge and the mean frequency decreased markedly. In spite of the continued infusion of sufentanil, there were very little further changes in the EEG activity. This ceiling effect for the EEG changes appear to coincide with the failure to respond to verbal command.

Accordingly, we examined the EEG in 12 healthy, young male volunteers during desflurane anesthesia. Each subject had a baseline recording and then steady-state exposure to 6, 9, and 12% (0.83, 1.24, and 1.66 MAC) desflurane in O2 alone, and to 3, 6, and 9% desflurane in O2 with 60% N2O. The sequence of doses and the presence of N2O were randomized. We used mechanical ventilation to maintain normocapnia at each dose level. We also tested the effects of hypercapnia secondary to spontaneous ventilation. Additionally, at 1.24 MAC, subjects' lungs were hyperventilated to a PCO2 of 25.8 +/- 0.7 mmHg and exposed to rhythmic, loud clapping to attempt to provoke excitatory phenomena. Finally, after at least 6 h exposure to desflurane, we repeated measurements at 0.83 and 1.66 MAC to assess possible tolerance. Four channels of EEG were monitored visually, and at each dose, a quantitative EEG analysis was performed. Desflurane produced EEG changes comparable to those observed with equipotent levels of isoflurane. No epileptiform activity was seen. Desflurane significantly suppressed EEG activity; prominent burst suppression was seen at 1.24 MAC and higher. Substitution of N2O for 0.42 MAC desflurane reduced the degree of EEG suppression relative to the equipotent administration of desflurane and O2.

Since the irritation caused by an endotracheal tube in situ might enhance the sensitivity of neck muscles in detecting arousal, EMG recordings from sternocleidomastoid muscles (NEMG) were compared to FEMG recordings under five different clinical conditions with 10 patients in each group. Two Anesthesia and Brain Activity Monitors (ABM, Datex Instrumentarium, Helsinki) were used simultaneously for recordings. NEMG was more sensitive than FEMG in detecting increases in EMG activity under all five conditions, although less distinct under conditions with a profound (90-100%) neuromuscular blockade.

The patients were anaesthetized with isoflurane, halothane or etomidate/fentanyl. A multiparametric method was used for extraction of amplitude and frequency information from the EEG. The method applied autoregressive modelling of the signal, segmented in 2 s fixed intervals. The features from the EEG segments were used for learning and for classification. The learning process was unsupervised and hierarchical clustering analysis was used to construct a learning set of EEG amplitude-frequency patterns for each of the three anaesthetic drugs. These EEG patterns were assigned to a colour code corresponding to similar clinical states. A common learning set could be used for all patients anaesthetized with the same drug. The classification process could be performed on-line and the results were displayed in a class probability histogram. This histogram reflected in all patients the depth of anaesthesia, when the concentration of the anaesthetic agent was adjusted either based on clinical signs or according to the protocol. This uniform display, where colours in a class probability histogram indicate the depth of anaesthesia, may in the future serve as on-line advice for the administration of anaesthetics.

After induction with thiopental, the patients were hyperventilated (carbon dioxide tension, 25 to 28 mm Hg) with 4% isoflurane in oxygen until a burst-suppression EEG appeared. Brain electrical activity was compared before anesthesia, at 0.5 to 0.8% and 1.8 to 2.1% isoflurane, during bursts, and after anesthesia. Starting from an alpha EEG with occipital predominance, a distinct alpha activation appeared over the whole cortex during 0.5 to 0.8% isoflurane. Decreased alpha amplitude with a maximum over the frontotemporal regions was observed during 1.8 to 2.1% isoflurane. Bursts consisted of high amplitude in all frequency bands. In the delta and the theta bands, voltage was very low before isoflurane administration, and increased in relation to depth of anesthesia. A minimum in delta and theta amplitudes occurred over both central regions. The dominant frequency, defined as the frequency component with the highest amplitude in the frequency spectrum, decreased from 8 to 4 and finally to 1 Hz, while its amplitude increased from 3 to 13 microV. As anesthesia deepened, the dominant frequency shifted from the occiput to the frontal cortex.

A baseline electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during 10 min in children awake, supine with eyes closed and opened, and then from the beginning of induction until 5 min after tracheal intubation. Spontaneous movements were observed in all children in group A but only in 14% in groups B and C. The induction EEG sequences were similar for the three groups: after a mean latency of 12 s, the tracing showed an increase in frequency from 9 to 10 Hz (alpha waves) to more than 14 Hz (beta waves). This transition lasted approximately 2 s, followed by delta waves (2-3 Hz) that continued for 1-2 min. Finally, beta waves reappeared and progressively but incompletely replaced delta waves during the next 5 min. Neither spikes, spike-wave patterns, rhythmic theta waves, nor burst suppressions were observed. Spontaneous movements were recorded on videotape and analyzed after the completion of the study by a neurologist unaware of patient treatment. Videotape analysis of the periinduction period showed spontaneous movements to be dystonic and choreiform with flexion, twisting, or extension movements of all extremities.

At the onset of EEG burst, the heart rate started to accelerate, and at the onset of suppression it started to decelerate. These changes in heart rate are similar to those we have previously described with enflurane, despite several differences in the effects of these two anaesthetics on EEG and on the cardiovascular system. We hypothesise that the heart-rate changes are due to central inhibition mediated by the vagus nerve during EEG suppression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2275329/
2240671,Electroencephalographic changes during brief cardiac arrest in humans.,Anesthesiology,1990,"Clute HL, Levy WJ","Slowing and attenuation of the dominant frequency of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are changes commonly used to detect cerebral ischemia. To assess the validity of this method, the EEGs recorded during 93 episodes of circulatory arrest in ten normothermic, lightly anesthetized patients undergoing implantation of automatic internal cardioverting defibrillators (AICDs) were visually inspected for change. The number of events recorded for each patient varied from 5 to 18 and was a function of the duration and success of AICD testing in each patient. In 82 of 93 (88%) episodes, EEG changes were identified, and occurred an average of 10.2 s after the last normal heart beat. Of these 82, 67 (82%) illustrated slowing and attenuation. However, 15 (18%) of the hemodynamic events showed changes not previously described as indicative of cerebral ischemia: 6 (7%) showed a loss of delta-wave activity and 9 (11%) showed an increase in the amplitude of theta activity. Time to onset of these unusual changes (10.6 and 9.2 s, respectively) was not significantly different from that for EEG slowing and attenuation (10.2 s). Five of the ten subjects showed more than one pattern of EEG change. There was no significant difference in the time to onset of EEG change among individual patients, and neither were there differences in patterns of change associated with particular anesthetic agents. These results indicate that in normothermic, lightly anesthetized individuals, cerebral ischemia may cause changes in EEG pattern other than slowing and attenuation of dominant frequencies. These alternative patterns should be recognized as indicative of cerebral ischemia when intraoperative EEG monitoring is performed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2240671/

It was recorded during anesthesia in 10 elective surgical patients to evaluate its usefulness as a measure of the level of consciousness. The anesthetic agents used were thiopental, fentanyl, and isoflurane with or without nitrous oxide. Recordings were carried out during the period before induction and during induction, surgical anesthesia, emergence, and recovery from anesthesia. The level of consciousness was measured with an auditory stimulus detection task. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was also recorded for comparison with the ASSR. The following indices were analyzed: total EEG power, relative power in the beta, alpha, theta, and delta frequency bands, and the median and spectral edge frequency. The amplitude of the ASSR was reduced significantly at the end of the induction period and decreased below noise levels during surgical anesthesia. It increased significantly during emergence and recovery. The amplitude during recovery remained significantly smaller than the preinduction values. The changes of the ASSR paralleled those of the level of consciousness. The EEG measurements were distorted by the presence of muscle artifacts that were prominent during emergence and recovery. The amplitude of the ASSR appears to provide a more reliable indicator of the level of consciousness than the EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2221405/

Effects of single doses of captopril (12.5, 25 and 50 mg) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and on body sway were studied in fourteen healthy male subjects. Oxazepam (15 mg), as an active control, and two placebos were included in the study, together with a single dose of atenolol (100 mg). Medication was administered double-blind at 11.00 h, and assessments made before and at 2 and 4 h after drug ingestion. 2. There were no changes in the EEG with captopril. Oxazepam reduced the circadian rise in alpha activity, while atenolol decreased beta power. Delta activity was modified by both oxazepam and atenolol. 3. A reduction in lower frequencies of body sway (0.05-1 Hz) occurred with captopril, while the spectra were unaffected by oxazepam. Atenolol increased (P less than 0.05) activity in the frequency range 0.75-2.75 Hz. 4. These observations suggest that captopril is free of central effects such as sedation that may occur with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.

Recording and analysis was performed with the cerebral function analysing monitor (CFAM). At equivalent MAC, the two agents exhibited distinctive neurophysiological profiles. Increasing concentrations of isoflurane produced a clear sequence of EEG changes (decreasing fast and increasing slow components) then burst suppression activity suggesting cortical depression. With halothane, changes in EEG amplitude were less pronounced and those in frequency content less systematic, with no periods of suppression.

The median frequency of the EEG power spectrum served as the pharmacodynamic variable constituting feedback. Based on previous investigations a median frequency from 2-3 Hz was chosen as the desired EEG set point. In addition to methohexital, patients were given a 10-min loading infusion of 0.5 mg of fentanyl followed by a constant-rate infusion of 0.22 mg/h. In agreement with an earlier similar study in volunteers given only methohexital and aiming at the same set point, identical distribution of EEG power was achieved in the current study. The decrease of median EEG frequency to 2-3 Hz was primarily induced by an increase in fractional power in the 0.5-2- Hz frequency band to 46 +/- 4%. The average requirement of methohexital during the first 2 h was 675 +/- 250 mg.

Based on the probability that emboli released at the time of aortic declamping cause most postoperative central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, this study was designed to test whether administration of a single bolus dose of thiopental before aortic declamping provided cerebral protection equal to that of infusion throughout bypass as well as a decrease in unwanted side effects. One hundred adult patients undergoing open-chamber cardiac operations with CPB received either thiopental sodium by infusion throughout CPB (n = 52) or thiopental sodium 15 mg/kg by bolus before aortic declamping (n = 48). In 90% of the patients, thiopental sodium 15 mg/kg produced electroencephalographic (EEG) burst suppression, with more than 60 seconds between bursts. Postoperative CNS dysfunction occurred in 3 (6%) of the infusion group patients (thiopental sodium 36 +/- 10 mg/kg) and 2 (4%) of the bolus group patients (thiopental sodium 16 +/- 2 mg/kg). CNS dysfunction persisting to the tenth postoperative day occurred in only one patient, who was in the infusion group. Requirements for inotropic support on separation from CPB did not differ between groups, but average time to extubation was 2.7 hours shorter in the bolus group. The authors conclude that thiopental sodium 15 mg/kg given as a single bolus immediately before aortic declamping without the need for EEG monitoring provided the same brain protection as larger doses given by infusion titrated to burst suppression, but it did not reduce the need for inotropic support during separation from CPB.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2390255/

The present study of 15 patients was undertaken to evaluate changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), as measured with an intravenous (IV) tracer (133Xenon) technique, and to relate CBF changes to changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG). CBF was measured before and after induction of anesthesia, during cross-clamping of the carotid artery, after release of the clamps, and at 24 hours after the operation. All the patients were anesthetized with methohexitone, fentanyl, and nitrous oxide and oxygen. EEG was continuously recorded during the operation. Carotid artery shunts were not used. In 8 patients, cross-clamping of the carotid artery did not influence the EEG. In this group of patients, induction of anesthesia caused a 38% decrease in CBF, which presumably reflects the normal reaction to the anesthetic agent given. There were no further changes in CBF during cross-clamping. In 7 patients, the EEG showed signs of deterioration during the intraoperative vascular occlusion. In these patients, anesthesia did not cause any CBF change, whereas cross-clamping the artery induced a 33% decrease in CBF. In individual patients, the severity of EEG changes correlated with the decrease in CBF. The absence of a change in CBF by anesthesia and a decrease due to cross-clamping of the carotid artery may be explained by the presence of a more advanced cerebrovascular disease and an insufficiency to maintain CBF during cross-clamping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2354055/

In the first of our normal volunteer studies, we compared single doses of alpidem, 25, 50 and 100 mg with lorazepam 2 mg and placebo on a range of cognitive, psychomotor and EEG variables. Lorazepam and the highest (100 mg) dose of alpidem impaired performance on a range of psychomotor tasks, the effects of the benzodiazepine being more severe and more prolonged. No impairment of performance was observed with the 25 and 50 mg doses. In the second study, the focus was on memory functions. Lorazepam, 2 mg, caused anterograde amnesia which was most apparent 1 h post-drug but persisted until 4 h: sedation was marked. By contrast, single doses (25, 50 mg) of alpidem had little effect on either memory or alertness. The third study compared the effects of alpidem (25, 50 mg) and lorazepam (1 mg) with placebo, each given twice-daily for 8 days to normal volunteers. On the final day, a test dose of ethanol was given. Lorazepam impaired many tests of cognitive and psychomotor function, and this impairment was enhanced by ethanol. By contrast, alpidem produced less impairment with less interaction with alcohol.

Nitrous oxide was added to the inspired gas twice. The first admixture induced three successive stages of electroencephalogram (EEG): delta-waves lasting for 13 +/- 12 min, theta-waves lasting for 41 +/- 21 min, and, finally, spindle-type waves. The spindle-type EEG was similar to that of halothane anesthesia in configuration, but smaller in amplitude and faster in frequency than that seen during halothane anesthesia. The second admixture, given after a 20-30-min interval, induced a continuous delta-wave EEG in one patient, theta-waves followed by spindle EEG in eight patients, and spindle-type EEG in four patients. The successive changes of electroencephalographic response during the first admixture indicate that an alteration of central nervous system function occurred. The altered state was maintained in the absence of nitrous oxide: responses to a second admixture were characteristic of the later, altered, stages of responses seen after the first admixture. These findings support the view of acute tolerance to nitrous oxide.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2316879/

Analogue rating scales were used to assess the efficacy of the treatments while tolerance and residual effects were measured weekly using a battery of performance tests (Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold, Choice Reaction Time, Letter Cancellation and Digit Span). Physical and clinical examinations, including ECG and EEG, were conducted before and after the experimental period and spontaneously reported side-effects were recorded. Analysis of variance on 24 completed cases (8 patients in each treatment group) showed both active treatments to be significantly better than placebo in shortening sleep onset latency. Flurazepam increased the duration of sleep and produced a ""hangover"" of impaired psychomotor function. Zopiclone had no observable effect on early morning performance and was free from residual sedative activity. The lack of residual effects with zopiclone 7.5 mg, at a dose shown to be clinically effective, suggests its use in ambulant or out-patient populations where daytime sedation could interfere with every day activities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2201731/
2180345,Pro- and anticonvulsant effects of anesthetics (Part II).,Anesthesia and analgesia,1990,"Modica PA, Tempelhoff R, White PF","Perioperative seizures have numerous potential etiologies. In general, when seizures occur during surgery, their onset often coincides with the introduction of a specific anesthetic or analgesic drug. Conversely, postoperative seizures are more commonly due to nonanesthetic causes. However, there have been reports of postoperative convulsions that appeared to be caused by anesthetic or analgesic drugs administered intraoperatively via inhalation or injection (e.g., intravenous, epidural, or peripheral nerve block). Some anesthetics appear to possess both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant properties. One possible factor is an inherent pharmacodynamic variability in the responsiveness of inhibitory and excitatory target tissues in the CNS. This is well illustrated by the anticonvulsant and proconvulsant effects of progressively higher doses of local anesthetic drugs. This variability in neuronal responsiveness could also explain the conflicting findings for low versus high doses of fentanyl and etomidate. Furthermore, biological variation in the individual patient's responsiveness to certain anesthetic drugs could be an additional contributory factor. Differing structure-activity relationships might also explain why some anesthetic agents possess both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant properties. Relatively minor modifications in a drug's structure can influence its affinity for a specific receptor site and its intrinsic pharmacologic activity. For example, when methohexital was first introduced, convulsions were commonly encountered in patients with and without a history of epilepsy. Subsequent fractionation of the original compound into its two isomeric forms resulted in the identification of the isomer primarily responsible for this convulsive activity. In its present formulation (Brevital; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Ind.), the epileptogenic properties of methohexital are limited to patients with psychomotor epilepsy. However, compared with thiopental, excitatory effects are still more common with methohexital. The excitatory effects of methohexital are presumably due to its methylated structure. The inhaled anesthetic flurothyl (hexaflurodiethyl) ether and the intravenous anesthetic ketamine also illustrate how subtle changes in stereoisomerism can result in significant changes in structure-activity relationships. Flurothyl, a fluorinated ether analogue, reliably produces convulsions in nonepileptic patients, whereas its structural isomer isoindoklon has not been associated with seizure activity. Other examples of isomer or structural analogue relationships that produce differential effects on neuronal hyperexcitability include enflurane-isoflurane and meperidine-normeperidine. In conclusion, the patient population (epileptic or nonepileptic), the method of documentation (EEG study or clinical observation), and the method of EEG analysis (cortical or depth electrodes) must be considered to properly analyze the proconvulsant and/or anticonvulsant properties of an anesthetic or analgesic drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2180345/

Quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) analyses of changes induced by atropine (1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/70 kg, intramuscularly) were assessed in seven male volunteers in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over experiment. Spontaneous EEG recordings were obtained from relaxed subjects before, 2 hours after, and 8 hours after atropine. Atropine significantly increased delta power, decreased alpha power, and tended to increase theta power and reduce beta and theta frequency. EEG indices of vigilance were reduced by the drug.

Eleven patients with a history of excessive alcohol intake were studied from an inpatient alcohol rehabilitation program and compared with nine control patients or volunteers who were social drinkers. The alcoholic population had consumed ethanol 9-17 days prior to the study. They had no evidence of acute intoxication or acute withdrawal at the time of the study. Five of the 11 alcoholic patients were restudied after 1 month of abstinence from alcohol consumption. Each study consisted of a thiopental infusion until EEG burst suppression (1-3 s of isoelectric signal) was achieved. Timed arterial and then venous blood samples were obtained for measurement of thiopental serum concentrations for up to 36 h. Pharmacokinetic differences between groups were analyzed using a three-compartment model. Power spectral analysis of the EEG allowed determination of spectral edge frequency. An inhibitory sigmoid Emax pharmacodynamic model combined with an effect compartment was used to analyze concentration-response relationships and to provide an estimate of brain sensitivity to thiopental in the study populations. The thiopental anesthetic dose requirement using the EEG was not different between alcoholics and nonalcoholics.

Using a larger group of patients and volunteers studied in the laboratory, the authors have re-examined thiopental pharmacokinetics and EEG pharmacodynamics relative to age. A population data analysis approach (NONMEM), using a three-compartment model, was used to analyze bolus and rapid iv infusion thiopental serum concentration versus time data from 64 subjects. A one-compartment model was also used on the first 10 min of serum concentration data to focus only on the initial distribution phase. The population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that when thiopental is administered via an iv bolus injection, traditional pharmacokinetic models limit the accurate characterization of thiopental distribution phenomena. Using the rapid iv infusion data, the pharmacokinetic mechanism for the decreased thiopental dose requirement in the elderly was a decreased rapid intercompartment clearance. Thiopental distribution from the central compartment of the three-compartment model to the rapidly equilibrating compartment (rapid intercompartment clearance) decreased 27% between the ages of 35-80 yr and decreased 34% in the one-compartment analysis. EEG spectral edge versus time data from 37 subjects was analyzed with a semiparametric modelling approach to remove the disequilibrium between thiopental serum concentration and the spectral edge. A population data analysis (NONMEM) was performed with several pharmacodynamic models.

Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 50 micrograms/kg with no EEG monitoring (n = 16) or 25 to 50 micrograms depending on changes in EEG (n = 16). EEG, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter, intra-arterial blood pressure (BP), central venous pressure (CVP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) (n = 18) were monitored continuously. Cardiac output (CO), CVP, PAP, spectral-edge frequency for each hemisphere, and BP were recorded before induction, immediately before intubation, and 1 and 5 minutes after intubation. With EEG monitoring, intubation was performed when spectral-edge frequency decreased to 10 Hz or less. Recall and pain were investigated 2 to 12 weeks postoperatively. With EEG, the amount of fentanyl used before intubation was significantly lower (39.7 +/- 2 micrograms/kg; p less than 0.005) than without EEG (50 micrograms/kg). The decrease in BP (% change) was less with than without EEG; mean changes in BP between preinduction and preintubation were -7.4% +/- 3.8% and -16.5% +/- 3.1% and between preinduction and 1 minute after intubation 0.3% +/- 3.4% and -12.5% +/- 3.5%, respectively.

These patients had no history or clinical manifestation of intracranial hemorrhage. All were treated with anticonvulsant agents by their neurologists but became disabled due to inadequate control of seizures by medication, side effects of the anticonvulsant drugs, or the effects on their professional lives of even infrequent seizures. The age of the patients ranged from 13 to 61 years. There were 13 males and 14 females. The AVM's were smaller than 2 cm in four patients, between 2 and 4 cm in five, and larger than 4 cm in 18. The most frequent location of the AVM's was in the temporal lobe, followed by the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. All patients had preoperative electroencephalography (EEG) and intraoperative electrocorticography. Intraoperative recording of the amygdala and the hippocampus by depth electrodes was performed if the AVM's were located in the temporal lobe. Superficial or posterior temporal lobe AVM's often have remote seizure foci that involve the amygdala and hippocampus. All patients underwent craniotomy and total excision of their AVM's. Surgery was carried out under local anesthesia to allow localization by electrical stimulation if the AVM involved the speech area or the sensorimotor cortex. Based on the EEG findings, excision of the epileptogenic lesion in addition to the AVM was performed in 18 patients. In seven patients with AVM's located in the temporal lobe, remote seizure foci were identified and excised. The remote epileptic activity was particularly prominent in AVM's in the temporal lobe and usually involved mesial temporal structures. Microscopic study of excised seizure foci showed gliosis in 26 cases, hemosiderin deposits in 10, and focal hemorrhage in four. There were no operative deaths. Two patients developed a hemiparesis and three suffered temporary dysphasia after surgery. Two patients had visual field deficits. The results of postoperative seizure control during the average follow-up period of 3 years 11 months were excellent in 21 patients, good in three, fair in two, and poor in one. The latter patient, whose epileptic lesion was not completely excised because of its location in the motor cortex, had poor seizure control postoperatively. Another patient required a second operation to remove a remote seizure focus. In this series, proposed mechanisms of seizure associated with cerebral AVM include focal cerebral ischemia secondary to arteriovenous shunting, gliosis of the surrounding brain, and a secondary epileptogenesis in the temporal lobe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2295919/

Neurobehavioural testing showed no differences between the ephedrine and the non-ephedrine groups of infants at ages of 3 h, 1 day, 2 days and 4-5 days, whereas the spectral EEG showed significant differences between the two groups during the first 2 h after delivery, which had disappeared 24 h later. It is suggested that small doses of ephedrine given to the mother i.v. to prevent hypotension during spinal anaesthesia have short-lived effects on the neonate's central nervous system, which will be detected in the spectral EEG, but not in neurobehavioural tests.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2309548/

PTB administered by continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion pump at a loading dose of 6-8 mg/kg in 40-60 min was usually sufficient to produce BSP activity and seizure control. PTB was continued 0-24 h at 1-4 mg/kg/h, adjusted to maintain blood pressure (BP) and BSP. Infusion rate was decreased if systolic BP (SBP) was less than 90 mm Hg. Normal saline fluid challenge was occasionally used to elevate BP, but in no case was it necessary to discontinue PTB infusion or use pressors. Other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were maintained at therapeutic levels for chronic seizure protection. Seizures were stopped in all cases. Four patients attained premorbid neurologic status, two patients briefly survived in vegetative states with recurring seizures after PTB withdrawal, and one patient died of asystole after receiving PTB for 7 h. Patients who had poor outcomes had prolonged seizures (16 h to 3 weeks) before institution of PTB anesthesia, and all had significant underlying central nervous system (CNS) pathology. PTB-induced BSP appears to be safe and effective for refractory SE if it is started soon after failure of a BZD and PHT. Ultimate prognosis depends on SE etiology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2303014/

We report on effects of electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in five patients with medically intractable seizures as part of a clinical trial of chronic vagal stimulation for control of epilepsy. The mechanism of action of the vagal antiepileptic effect is unknown, and it is hoped that analysis of electrophysiological effects of vagal nerve stimulation will help elucidate which brain areas are affected. Stimulation of the left vagus nerve in the neck was accomplished with a programmable implanted stimulator. Effects of stimulus amplitude, duration, and rate were studied. Noncephalic reference recording of the vagus-nerve-evoked potential showed some unusual properties: a scalp negative component occurred with latency of 12 ms, very high amplitude (up to 60 microV), and widespread scalp distribution. Field distribution studies indicate that this potential is generated in the neck, in the region of the stimulating electrodes. Muscle paralysis confirms this observation. Stimulation at various frequencies had no noticeable effect on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity regardless of whether the patient was under general anesthesia, awake, or asleep.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2226367/

Each patient had a treatment of 2 weeks with 250 ml 20% Actovegin and 250 ml placebo daily with an interval of 3 weeks in between (the order of drugs sequence was randomized). Pharmacodynamic evaluations were carried out 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after the administration of one single infusion on day 1 (acute effect), at 0 h on day 15 (subacute effect) as well as 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after one additional superimposed infusion on day 15 (superimposed effect). EEG brain mapping demonstrated that Actovegin exerted a significant action on the human brain function as compared with placebo characterized by a decrease of delta and theta, an increase of alpha-adjacent slow beta, a decrease of fast beta, an acceleration of the centroid of the delta/theta and alpha activity, a slowing of the beta centroid and an increase of the centroid of the total activity. Topographically the encephalotropic effects were mostly pronounced in the parietal, frontocentral and temporooccipital regions. These changes are indicative of an improvement of vigilance which was proven also by psychometric investigations at the behavioral level. Actovegin improved the noopsyche mostly in regard to attention, memory and rigidity/perseveration measures. In regard to the thymopsyche an improvement was noted in mood, affectivity, well-being and sedation. Psychophysiological evaluations demonstrated an increase in CFF, skin conductance, pupillary diameter and shortening of the latency and augmentation of the amplitude of the pupillary response. Time-efficacy calculations exhibited more effect after subacute than acute administration with the pharmacodynamic maximum in the 4th h after the superimposed dose. Evaluations of pulse, blood pressure and side effects demonstrated a very good tolerability of the drug. Our present neurophysiological, psychometric and psychophysiological findings confirm earlier results obtained in elderlies with similar methodology.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2135068/
2109478,Midazolam and flumazenil in neuroanaesthesia.,Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica. Supplementum,1990,"Schulte am Esch J, Kochs E","Of the numerous benzodiazepines currently available, only a few are used in anaesthetic practice. Midazolam is utilised as a premedicant, sedative, and an induction agent and produces minimal depression of ventilation or of the cardiovascular system. The anticonvulsant activity is similar to that of diazepam. In neuroanaesthesia midazolam may be an acceptable alternative to other intravenous induction agents like barbiturates or etomidate in patients with compromised intracranial compliance. Midazolam produces dose-related reductions in cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption. However, midazolam does not necessarily prevent increases in intracranial pressure during induction of anaesthesia. In the electroencephalogram (EEG) midazolam produces a reduction in alpha-activity, an increase in theta-delta-activity and low-voltage beta-activity. Midazolam like other benzodiazepines does not affect early components of auditory and somatosensory evoked responses, whereas late cortical responses may be suppressed. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, has been demonstrated to be effective in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation. In the EEG midazolam-induced changes vanish almost instantaneously. Flumazenil is also effective in restoring the amplitudes of cortical auditory and somatosensory evoked responses. However, as has been demonstrated in head-injured patients and animal experiments after incomplete cerebral ischaemia, increases in cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure cannot be excluded after flumazenil administration. When utilising flumazenil for wake-up procedures in midazolam-sedated patients with pathological intracranial compliance, flumazenil has to be titrated very carefully in low doses over prolonged periods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2109478/

As with many behavioral constructs, attempts at quantification are difficult, and consequently, subjective reports of antihistamine sedation are frequently relied upon. Evoked potential activity is one method to quantitate the brain's response to subtle cognitive change. Evoked potentials are characteristic shifts in the brain's electrical activity that are obtained by time-locking the ongoing EEG to a stimulus over repeated trials. A late positive component of the evoked potential (P3) has been related to various psychologic properties including expectation, selective attention, and information processing speed. Because of this relationship, we employed the latency of the P3 evoked potential to measure the cognitive effects of chlorpheniramine and terfenadine. In healthy young subjects, we observed that terfenadine produces significantly less cognitive slowing of the P3 potential than chlorpheniramine. This finding supports the subjective findings of reduced sedative side effects of terfenadine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2574552/

After a single DZ administration, the EEG change corresponding to sedation appeared rapidly and showed a short duration. A close relationship was found between these effects and changes in the DZ plasma concentrations. DZ and synthesized NDDZ had the same pharmacodynamic characteristics, but the main metabolic product of DZ (metabolite NDDZ) showed a different pharmacokinetic profile. A multiple administration of DZ or synthesized NDDZ caused some reduction in sedation at the steady-state. These results led to the conclusions that a single administration of DZ causes sedation of a short duration, and the main metabolic product of DZ (metabolite NDDZ) does not seem to contribute to sedation. In addition, the reduction in the pharmacological effect after continuous treatment with DZ depends not on autoinduction or interference, but on acute tolerance or adaptation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2517763/

We found ADQ patterns produced by cardiopulmonary bypass, hypothermia and general anaesthetic agents correlated with those obtained from a compressed spectral array (CSA) monitor and could be differentiated from changes caused by cerebral ischaemia, except in the youngest group of patients (less than or equal to 18 months) undergoing deep hypothermia (19.4 (SD 0.8) degrees C nasopharyngeal). In all other age groups the ADQ proved to be a simple monitor of the adequacy of cerebral perfusion. Neurological deficit occurred only if the ADQ was abnormal during hypotension for a period exceeding 7 min. ADQ evaluation of cerebral function was limited by events which produced artificially normal ADQ readings such as low amplitude EEG activity and the described isoflurane effect that was demonstrated to occur in some cardiac patients.

The study was conducted to investigate whether there was a significant correlation between EEG changes and arterial halothane concentration in infants. The power spectral analysis of EEGs was performed by the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Arterial halothane concentration was measured with gas chromatography. The relationship between the changes in the power spectra of EEGs and the arterial halothane concentration was examined by means of a multivariate analysis. Prior to administration of halothane, two kinds of EEG patterns were discernible. In one pattern the peak of the EEG power spectra was seen in the slow wave band (slow wave group); in the other the peak of the power spectra was present in the fast wave band (fast wave group). In the occipital lead the multiple correlation coefficient and the index of determination of the slow wave group were 0.71 and 0.50, respectively, and those of the fast wave group were 0.78 and 0.61, respectively. A significant correlation was proved to be present between the normalized values of the EEG power spectra and arterial halothane concentration in the occipital lead. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that the relationship between changes in the power spectra of EEGs in the occipital lead and arterial halothane concentration in infants can be expressed by means of multiple regression formulas.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2511729/

For up to 4 1/2 hours following administration the effects of each substance on brain function were measured using computer analyzed EEG recordings (CEEG) and a new technique called Dynamic Brain Mapping. The following observations were made: 1. Both active drugs produce statistically significant CNS effects as measured by CEEG changes. These changes were observed earlier with diazepam than with lorazepam. 2. Although both compounds are classified as anxiolytic by the routine computer EEG data base, the detailed brain mapping technology indicated that the CNS effects of diazepam and lorazepam were quantitatively and qualitatively different. 3. Clinical CNS side-effects (sedation) were seen more frequently with lorazepam than with diazepam. This was consistent with the EEG slowing producing properties of lorazepam.

The raw EEG was obtained using bilateral frontomastoid electrodes. The compressed spectral array was digitized and recorded on disk in 4-s epochs using a Tractor Northern ""Nomad"" processor. The EEG information was displayed in four formats: 1) the frequency-power spectrum from 1-20 Hz, 2) the 95% power frequency, 3) the 50% power frequency, and 4) the ratio of power in the 8-20 Hz frequency range to the power in the 1-4 Hz frequency range (delta ratio). During emergence from isoflurane, there were obvious changes in the EEG frequency-power spectrum that occurred several minutes before patients opened their eyes in response to verbal stimuli. Although no one descriptor of EEG activity could be shown to be superior in anticipating when patients would respond by opening their eyes, awakening was always presaged by an abrupt decrease in power in the 1-4 Hz frequency range; this resulted in a marked increase in the delta ratio value. During emergence from fentanyl anesthesia, however, there was no obvious change in the overall EEG frequency-power spectrum. However, the same numeric EEG descriptors that were predictive of awakening from isoflurane also occurred during emergence from fentanyl, even though they usually occurred within 1 min of awakening. It is concluded that EEG criteria for identifying when patients will awaken from anesthesia are more reliable with isoflurane than with fentanyl.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2764286/

Ten healthy women (ASA group I) were investigated during non-critical surgery. Two channels of the EEG were stored on tape simultaneously with alveolar concentration of carbon dioxide, inspired oxygen concentration, mean arterial pressure, ECG and temperature. Signal processing was made offline. Spectral information from 2-s EEG segments was extracted using autoregressive modelling. Repetitive hierarchical clustering was used to define a common learning set of basic patterns. With this learning set, the EEG was classified, and the results presented in a class probability histogram. The basic patterns were related to the clinical depth of anaesthesia in all patients and assigned specific colours. Using this colour code, the class probability histogram showed a high degree of simplicity. Decreasing or increasing the isoflurane concentration caused the same trend in the class profile in all patients.

Of 13 patients who received high-dose phenytoin (PHT, mean dose 23.8 mg/kg), seizure control was sustained in five patients. In 12 cases, anesthetic doses of pentobarbital rapidly suppressed convulsions, but sustained control required prolonged treatment. Break-through seizures were, in most cases, explained by inadequate serum pentobarbital concentrations, although we could not establish a therapeutic range of serum concentrations. EEG monitoring is necessary to assess the therapeutic response but is not a reliable index of depth of anesthesia. Some cases developed pharmacodynamic tolerance to pentobarbital. The most serious treatment complications were cardiorespiratory, but the most common and disabling side effects, although reversible, were neurologic.

The Anesthesia and Brain Activity Monitor (ABM Datex) providing the zero crossing frequency (ZXF) as a value for the mean frequency of the EEG signal during a considered time interval, the mean integrated voltage (MIV) as a mean value of the amplitude of the same EEG signal and the spontaneous electromyography of the frontal muscle (SEMG). 2. The EEG trend monitor (rough signal, spectral analysis (S.A.), procentual display). The EEG changes, recorded during propofol anesthesia, are comparable with both techniques. Induction is characterised by a decrease in ZXF, caused by a procentual increase in the low frequency bands (the delta band represents more than 80% of the total power). During the perfusion period an increase in the power of the alpha band (10% to 40%) and a decrease in the delta band is noticed. The ZXF regains its original value. At the end of the procedure the ZXF increases (beta band to more than 30%). A correlation was looked for between the EEG changes and the propofol blood concentrations.

Ten normal volunteers received randomized (latin square design) and at weekly intervals, single oral doses of placebo, 0.05 mg, 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg Ro 16-6028 and 10 mg diazepam as reference substance. EEG-recordings, psychometric tests and evaluation of blood pressure, pulse and side effects were carried out at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 h. Computer-assisted spectral analysis of the EEG demonstrated after 10 mg diazepam, a typical ""anxiolytic"" pharmaco-EEG profile characterized by an increase of beta activity, decrease of alpha activity and acceleration of the centroid total activity. Ro 16-6028 induced in the vigilance-controlled recordings a similar profile thereby exhibiting tranquilizing properties too. However, in the resting condition we observed also an increase of delta/theta activity along with a decrease of alpha activity while the beta augmentation was observed mostly in the fast frequency bands and not so much in the middle fast frequency bands as is the case with the known full agonists. The latter findings were somewhat reminiscent of the pharmaco-EEG profiles seen often in certain neuroleptics. Our data indicate a selective sedation after the novel partial agonist. Dose/treatment-efficacy calculations demonstrated 10 mg diazepam as the most CNS-effective drug followed closely by 0.2 mg Ro 16-6028, 0.1 mg and 0.05 mg, while placebo induced the least changes. Only 0.2 mg Ro 16-6028 and the reference compound differed from placebo at all times.

After 0.2 mg Ro 16-6028 a decrease of attention, numerical memory, psychomotor activity, wakefulness and CFF was observed, while mood improved at later time periods outlasting the sedation. After 10 mg diazepam 10 out of 13 psychometric and psychophysiological variables showed significant findings previously described as typical for anxiolytic sedatives in normals. On the whole, the partial agonist induced less sedation than the full agonist, which is reflected in its superiority in regard to noopsychic and thymopsychic functions.

A principal component (PC) analysis, using such EEG elements as wave percent-time (8 bands) and average amplitude (7 bands), resulted in a considerable reduction of variables (4 PCs). In O1, because of high positive loadings in the average amplitude in all bands and a decrease in the mean score with either drug, PC-1 represents a component which reacts in the form of diminution of average amplitude as a whole. In Fp1, C3 and O1, PC-2, with a bipolarity of alpha 2 versus beta 1 and beta 2 in the wave percent-time in loading profile, could be a component showing characteristic changes common to the 2 benzodiazepines. In C3, because of a significant difference in the mean score between the 2 drugs, PC-4 might be a between-drug difference component in which diazepam (medazepam) increases (decreases) slow activity. The relationship between the score at PC-4 in C3 and daytime sleepiness may signify that the slow components are associated with sedation. Based on the correlation at PC-2 in Fp1, a marked increase in beta 1 and beta 2 components (responder) rather means less sleepiness, and relative preservation of alpha 1 and alpha 2 (non-responder) more sleepiness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2464483/
2910140,Electroencephalographic burst suppression in elderly and young patients anesthetized with isoflurane.,Anesthesia and analgesia,1989,"Schwartz AE, Tuttle RH, Poppers PJ","The electroencephalograms of seven elderly (70-85 years) and seven younger patients (23-31 years) anesthetized with a concentration of isoflurane sufficient to produce burst suppression were studied. Anesthesia in these unpremedicated subjects was induced by inhalation of nitrous oxide, isoflurane, and oxygen. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with succinylcholine and the lungs were next ventilated with oxygen and isoflurane to produce an end-tidal concentration of 1.7%. Isoflurane concentration was determined by infrared analysis of expired gas collected from a Teflon catheter inserted through the endotracheal tube. After 25 minutes at steady state, the EEG was recorded for 5 minutes prior to surgical stimulation. Arterial blood pressure, temperature, and ventilation were maintained at normal values. In elderly patients the EEG had both a greater proportion of total time in electrical silence (76.0 +/- 10.8% vs 37.6 +/- 15.4%; P less than 0.01) and a greater number of isoelectric periods (19.7 +/- 8.1 vs 10.7 +/- 5.4; P less than 0.05).

Sixty nine patients were schizophrenic and had previously received one or more neuroleptics but with insufficient response or severe side effects. Nine patients suffered from tardive dyskinesia (TD), 44 patients had other diagnoses. Twenty two per cent of the schizophrenic patients improved slightly, 65% markedly and in 13% the symptoms nearly totally disappeared. Fourty per cent of chronic schizophrenics showed improvement of anergia. Eleven per cent of the patients with TD did not improve, 22% showed slight and 67% marked improvement. Clinically relevant side-effects occurred in 64% of patients: Generally sedation/hypotension, EG and ECG alterations, changes of white blood cell count, increase of liver enzymes and weight gain. EEG alteration correlated significantly with dosage of clozapine (P less than 0.01). In 6% of patients, severe side-effects led to discontinuation of clozapine treatment. No case of agranulocytosis occurred. Most patients tolerated the drug well and were compliant.

Schizophrenic patients were treated with clozapine for 48 +/- 35 (TD 49 +/- 40) days, dosage was 189 +/- 119 (TD 220 +/- 176) mg. Four per cent showed worsening, 13% no change, 38% slight improvement, 42% marked improvement and 3% nearly total reduction of symptoms. In TD, 44% showed marked improvement, but only in 17% the drug was superior to previous neuroleptics. Adverse effects occurred in 56% of patients. Most frequent were sedation (17%), EEG alterations (16%), increase of liver enzymes (8%), hypotension (7%), hypersalivation (5%), fever (5%), ECG alterations (4%), tachycardia (3%), gastro-intestinal (3%) and delirious states (2%). A gradual increase in dosage seems to considerably reduce the incidence of some side effects. Clozapine treatment had to be discontinued because of severe side effects in 5.9%. In none of these patients did serious complications such as agranulocytosis occur. Only EEG alterations were significantly related to clozapine dosage (P less than 0.0005). At dismissal, most patients continued to receive clozapine; only in 22% (TD 20%) was it replaced by another neuroleptic.

The power spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to quantify the effect of the opioids. Eight male surgical patients, 52-80 yr old, were randomly divided into eight groups of ten to receive fentanyl, 5, 7, 10, or 13 micrograms/kg, or sufentanil, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, or 1.3 micrograms/kg. The opioid was given iv over 1 min at a constant rate of infusion. Three to four minutes after the start of the opioid dose, thiopental was given iv in 25 mg increments every 30 s until the patient was unconscious. Power in the 1-3 Hz band reached maximum levels in less than 4 min after the start of opioid administration. At fentanyl doses of 7.0 micrograms/kg or less, or sufentanil doses of 1.0 micrograms/kg or less, the EEG effects did not increase in proportion to the dose of opioid. There was not a significant difference in the maximum power achieved in the 1-3 Hz band for sufentanil, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0, and fentanyl, 5 and 7 micrograms/kg. Doses of fentanyl, 10 or 13 micrograms/kg, or sufentanil, 1.3 micrograms/kg were substantially more effective; the maximum power increased significantly between 7 and 10 micrograms/kg of fentanyl and 1.0 and 1.3 micrograms/kg of sufentanil (P less than 0.0001).

These monitoring methods, however, have been slow to find acceptance in clinical practice. The reasons include the difficulty with standardization and reproducibility of results from such monitoring techniques as the electroencephalogram (EEG) and evoked potentials, along with the level of expertise necessary for accurate interpretation of the voluminous data collected. Anaesthetic agents along with variations in physiological parameters can markedly alter the recordings not to mention the influence of diathermy, other electrical devices, muscle activity and artifact. Because of these inherent difficulties, most anaesthetists still rely on optimising such physiological parameters as arterial, venous and intracranial pressures, oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, to ensure the functional integrity of the nervous system.

These studies have investigated the serum levels of opiate required to produce a decrease in anesthetic requirement for a concomitantly administered inhalation anesthetic. A linear dose-response relation has been observed between opiate serum level and reduction in anesthetic requirement up to the level of 50% reduction in minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC). These studies have not demonstrated the production of one MAC anesthesia by the opiates. Recent EEG studies have provided another means of comparing the central nervous system effects of opiates and inhalation anesthetics. The serum levels of several opiates associated with a 50% reduction (IC50 or 50% inhibitory concentration) in maximal spectral edge frequency (SEF) have been reported. The free, unionized serum levels of each opiate at IC50 in humans or 50% MAC reduction in animals are remarkably similar. We calculated brain lipid opiate content at these serum levels using available physiochemical data. The calculated nanogram and molar brain lipid contents of the drugs fell within a 10-fold range while serum levels varied by 5000-fold.

Following a retrospective review of eight patients treated with a variety of barbiturates and dosing regimens, we established a specific protocol employing pentobarbital and evaluated it prospectively in six patients. Among the 14 patients, intravenous barbiturates, when administered with a loading dose followed by continuous infusion, were uniformly effective in aborting seizures and producing a burst-suppression EEG pattern. Other than the pupillary light reflex, most patients lost all brainstem reflexes and motor responses during therapy. Barbiturate-induced hypotension was observed in 9 of the 14 patients, and required treatment with pressors in seven cases. Three patients died early as a consequence of their underlying illness, while three others died late for reasons unrelated to the status itself or to anticonvulsant therapy. The time to recovery of function following anesthesia varied highly, spanning hours to days for return of motor function and days to weeks for cognition. Of the eight survivors, four were left with mild cognitive deficits, one returned to his baseline dementia, and three had residual encephalopathies (severe in two).

The possible interaction (as indicated by rat experiments) between calcium channel blocking agents and benzodiazepines has been evaluated in nine healthy subjects. 2. Subsequently to an intravenous loading dose (0.07 mg kg-1) midazolam was infused for 6 h (0.035 mg kg-1 h-1) and steady state plasma levels between 54 to 114 micrograms l-1 were achieved. Two hours after the bolus of midazolam a solution of 20 mg nitrendipine or placebo was administered in a randomized, double-blind crossover fashion. 3. The marked sedative-hypnotic effects of midazolam as assessed by visual analogue scales (about four fold increase in the sedation index) and choice reaction time (100% prolongation) indicated some form of adaptation or tolerance towards the end of the infusion. However, the midazolam-induced impairments were not affected by nitrendipine. 4. EEG-data indicated stabile benzodiazepine-like effects during the complete infusion period of midazolam (e.g. decrease in alpha activity, increase in sigma, delta 2 and beta 1 activity). Again, these alterations were not modified by nitrendipine. 5. There was also no pharmacokinetic interaction between both agents, since elimination of midazolam (t 1/2 = 2.5 +/- 0.8 h; CL = 548 +/- 143 ml min-1) was in close agreement with control values (t 1/2 = 2.4 +/- 0.6 h; CL = 512 +/- 102 ml min-1).

The data were divided into those where the mean pre-bolus intracranial pressure (ICP) was above or below 20 mmHg and then subdivided into those where the minimum pre-bolus voltage of the cerebral function monitor (CFM) was above or below 5 microV (representing marked reduction in cortical electrical activity). The pre-bolus ICP influenced the extent of the fall in ICP and thus the direction of the resulting change in CPP. A mean reduction in CPP was observed in both groups in which ICP was below 20 mmHg irrespective of the CFM voltage. In the subgroups with high ICP, CPP increased when CFM was not depressed and fell when CFM was below 5 microV. The effects of individual boluses varied within and between the subgroups and, occasionally, severe and unpredictable hypotension occurred. If althesin administration had been restricted to the high CFM and high ICP group, 90% of the episodes of reduced CPP would have been avoided. In fact, when cortical electrical activity is already severely depressed, further administration of hypnotic anaesthetic agents produces only small reductions in ICP and usually a fall in CPP. These findings suggest that the minimum voltage of the CFM trace is a clinically useful guide to the administration of intravenous anaesthetic agents and offers a relevant prediction of their effects on CPP.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3361020/

We demonstrate a computer generated technique which provides a visually robust display of EEG data plotted as 'phase space trajectories' and a mathematically derived parameter ('dimensionality') which may correlate with depth of anesthesia. Application of nonlinear mathematical analysis, used to describe complex dynamical systems, can characterize 'phase space' EEG patterns by identifying attractors (geometrical patterns in phase space corresponding to specific ordered EEG data subjects) and by quantifying the degree of order and chaos (calculation of dimensionality). Dimensionality calculations describe the degree of complexity in a signal and may generate a clinically useful univariate EEG descriptor of anesthetic depth. In this paper we describe and demonstrate phase space trajectories generated for sine waves, mixtures of sine waves, and white noise (random chaotic events). We also present EEG phase space trajectories and dimensionality calculations from a patient undergoing surgery and general anesthesia in 3 recognizable states: awake, anesthetized, and burst suppression. Phase space trajectories of the three states are visually distinguishable, and dimensionality calculations indicate that EEG progresses from 'chaos' (awake) to progressively more 'ordered' attractors (anesthetized and burst suppression).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3351372/

Since benzodiazepines induce anterograde amnesia and sedation, these substances should show an opposite effect and so enhance memory and/or increase vigilance. In the present report we present data obtained in humans with a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist with weak inverse agonist properties, ZK 93426. The drug was given intravenously to human volunteers in double-blind, placebo-controlled designs and performance on several psychometric tests was evaluated. In a general estimation of behavioural changes volunteers experienced a stimulatory, activating effect of the drug. An improvement was observed in two cognitive tasks, the logical reasoning task and the pictures difference task, which estimate concentration and attentional processes respectively. No effects were found in a letter cancellation test or in time estimation. In another study utilizing EEG recording, we demonstrated that ZK 93426 increased wakefulness (vigilance) in healthy subjects during the daytime. The effect of ZK 93426 upon memory processes was also investigated utilizing a visual memory test and word lists.

Impairment of cognitive functions (LR and LD) induced by LMZ was also antagonized by ZK 93 426. ZK 93 426 had no effect on the changes in the time estimation seen in the LMZ group. Furthermore, ZK 93 426 on its own increased vigilance (alertness) as measured by the vigilosomnogram. A competitive antagonism at the benzodiazepine binding site between ZK 93 426 and LMZ is suggested by their combination effects; the intrinsic activity of ZK 93 426 seems to be due to its weak partial inverse agonist component.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2905500/

Each drug was given for 14 nights using a balanced design with at least 28 days between drug administrations. A test battery of physiological, psychological and subjective measures was administered on the mornings of days 1, 8, 14, 15 and 22 of the drug and post-drug periods. Seven days prior to and on days 1 to 28 of the drug and post-drug periods, sleep and self evaluation questionnaires were completed. Quazepam was associated with definite EEG effects, an unexpected improvement in simple motor performance and an increase in several bodily symptoms and ratings of sedation. Triazolam-impaired performance and also increased ratings of bodily symptoms and sedation. Two symptom increases with triazolam--metallic taste and touch sensitivity--might reflect day-time rebound. Sleep quality was improved by both drugs. There was little evidence of tolerance to drug effects on EEG or psychomotor tests. However tolerance was seen to the bodily symptoms and mood ratings. Rebound after drug discontinuation was not convincingly detected.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2895786/
2849177,Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) and physostigmine.,Resuscitation,1988,"Lauven PM, Stoeckel H","The pharmacologic effects of benzodiazepines may be counteracted either by functional antagonists like physostigmine acting via cholinergic mechanisms or by competitive antagonists like flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) acting via GABAergic mechanisms (GABA = Gamma-AminoButyric Acid). The lipophilic choline esterase inhibitor physostigmine adjusts a relatively or absolutely decreased concentration of acetylcholine at central cholinergic synaptic sites. As the neuronal network is very complex, many lipophilic compounds may cause a central anticholinergic syndrome even if they primarily do not affect cholinergic but, like benzodiazepines, GABAergic synaptic sites. Prolonged and/or adverse effects of such drugs may therefore be treated with 1-2 mg physostigmine at a maximal rate of 1 mg/min. The onset of physostigmine action can be expected within 2-20 min. Furthermore, the benzodiazepine action can very effectively be counteracted by the specific antagonist flumazenil. It could be demonstrated in volunteer and clinical studies that the hypnotic effect of benzodiazepines could be antagonized within 1-2 min. However, the minimal duration of action proved to be about 2 h as could be demonstrated by clinical observations, EEG-studies and psychometric tests. In clinical practice, a flumazenil dose of 0.3-0.8 mg proved to be the optimal dose range. The indication to treat unwanted central effects of benzodiazepines either with flumazenil or with physostigmine after anaesthesia should be restricted to cases of distinctly prolonged sedation after adequate dosage or adverse side effects. In intensive care, special indications for flumazenil and/or physostigmine may result after high benzodiazepine dosage or to differentiate a coma of undefined origin if centrally acting drugs including benzodiazepines are involved.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2849177/

In 87% of cases, methohexital caused selective activation of the epileptogenic focus during acute electrocorticography (ECoG). This activation appeared to be specific for the epileptogenic focus and did not cause epileptiform spiking from adjacent nonepileptogenic cortex. This ECoG activation occurred whether patients received local or general anesthesia. Sixty-five percent of patients demonstrated adequate activation with as little as 25 mg of drug.

The median frequency of the EEG power spectrum served as the pharmacodynamic variable constituting feedback. Median frequency values from 2-3 Hz were chosen as the desired EEG level (set-point). In 11 volunteers, the feedback system succeeded in maintaining a satisfactory depth of anesthesia (i.e., unresponsiveness to verbal commands and tactile stimuli). During feedback control, 75% of all measured median frequency values were in the preset range of 2-3 Hz. This distribution of median frequency was obtained by applying random stimulation (six different acoustic and tactile stimuli) to the volunteers approximately every 1.5 min. The decrease of median frequency from baseline to anesthetic values was primarily induced by increasing the fractional power in the frequency band of 0.5-2 Hz from 12.6 +/- 4.5% (mean +/- SD) to 46.0 +/- 2.5%. The median time to recovery (as defined by opening eyes on command) after cessation of the feedback control period was 20.6 min (10.7-44.5 min) when median EEG frequency was 5.2 Hz (4.7-8.4 Hz). The average requirement of methohexital (mean +/- SD) during the 2 h was 1.02 +/- 0.16 g. It is concluded that pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models of intravenous anesthetics established previously may be used to form a suitable background for model-based feedback control of anesthesia by quantitative EEG analysis. This approach gives a possible solution to the problem of adapting pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to individuals when using population mean data as starting values for drug therapy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3631609/

In a total of 2196 of these procedures, the patient received one of the three volatile anesthetics and, in 2010 of these, both the EEG and the CBF were monitored. Chronologically, halothane was the primary agent from 1972-1974; enflurane progressively replaced halothane during 1975-1981; and isoflurane was used almost exclusively since 1982. This analysis confirmed a previous study that the critical CBF during isoflurane anesthesia (703 procedures) was approximately 10 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1, as contrasted to that of approximately 20 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 during halothane anesthesia (467 procedures). This analysis also established that the critical CBF during enflurane anesthesia (840 procedures) was approximately 15 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1. The incidence of EEG ischemic changes was significantly less (P less than 0.001) during isoflurane anesthesia (18%) than during either enflurane (26%) or halothane (25%) anesthesia. This difference occurred despite the fact that the preoperative risk status was greater in the patients given isoflurane. There was no difference in neurologic outcome between the three anesthetics, and none was expected, since all patients with EEG changes were immediately shunted, if possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3631608/

ZK 91 296 and ZK 95 962, characterized as partial benzodiazepine agonists in preclinical research, were unable to induce some typical benzodiazepine effects like sedation when administered intravenously in high doses. ZK 95 962, reported to be effective in photoepileptic patients, was able to reverse lormetazepam-induced sleep as documented by EEG-parameters. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist ZK 93 426 dose-dependently elicited alertness, restlessness and mild apprehension--symptoms opposite those known for the benzodiazepines. The activating effect of ZK 93 426 was confirmed by the results from e.g., self-rating scales and the logical reasoning test. In another placebo-controlled study comparing the effects of ZK 93 426 alone and in combination with lormetazepam vigilosomnograms obtained after ZK 93 426 alone clearly confirmed the activating effect. In combination with lormetazepam ZK 93 426 was able to reverse the benzodiazepine induced sleep. The attenuation of benzodiazepine effects was also evident from multiple sleep latency tests. Our results support findings from animal experiments which classify these beta-carbolines as benzodiazepine receptor ligands with partial agonist and antagonist properties. beta-Carbolines may prove to be beneficial drugs in the treatment of anxiety, convulsions and diseases with an impairment of cognitive functions as well as in the reversal of unwanted benzodiazepine effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2890423/

Reductions in flow were performed 49 times to facilitate surgical manipulations, and on ten occasions (20%) resulted in EEG evidence of cerebral ischemia. Such ischemia was observed in 6 of 18 (33%) episodes during normothermia, but 0 of 18 episodes during stable hypothermia. In 4 of 13 (31%) cases of hypoperfusion during cooling at the start of cardiopulmonary bypass, EEG evidence of cerebral ischemia was also observed.

Similar patterns of glucose uptake were observed in both the presence and the absence of sedation, but overall glucose utilization was depressed an average of 20% and was closely correlated with the amount of diazepam administered prior to the injection of FDG. The predominant temporoparietal hypometabolism and relative sparing of frontal metabolism observed in this disease are therefore not explained by differences in anxiety or activity level in this patient group.

Ten normal volunteers received randomized (latin square) and at weekly intervals single oral doses of placebo, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg Ro 23-0364 and 10 mg diazepam as reference drug. EEG-recordings and evaluation of pulse, blood pressure and side effects were carried out at the hours 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8; psychometric tests at the same times except the first hour. Computer-assisted spectral analyses of the EEG demonstrated after 10 mg diazepam a typical ""anxiolytic"" pharmaco-EEG profile characterized by an increase of beta-activity, decrease of alpha-activity and absolute and relative power of the dominant frequency, furthered by an acceleration of the centroid of the total activity and a slowing of the centroid of the combined delta/theta-activity. In addition, there was an increase of delta-activity specifically in the resting recording condition suggesting also sedative properties of the reference compound. Ro 23-0364 induced in the vigilance-controlled recordings a similar profile as diazepam-although less pronounced-thereby exhibiting tranquilizing qualities. However, in the resting condition the most consistent change was an augmentation of delta/theta-activity along with an attenuation of alpha-activity, which was evident already in the lower dosage range and is reminiscent also of changes seen after sedative neuroleptic drugs (although the centroid slowing was missing). These data indicate a selective sedation of the mixed agonist/antagonist in the resting state. Dose-efficacy calculations based on EEG-changes demonstrated the reference compound, 1.0 and 0.5 mg Ro 23-0364 different from placebo. 10 mg diazepam was by far the most CNS-active compound inducing significantly more changes than the three doses of the mixed agonist/antagonist. Within the latter the two higher doses were superior to 0.25 mg but could not be differentiated from each other. Time-efficacy calculations showed the maximal encephalotropic effect of diazepam within the first two hours while the peak effect of 1.0 mg and 0.5 mg Ro 23-0364 fell into the 6th and 4th hour, respectively.

Epoch-to-epoch variability was computed within frequency bins for all segments, and ANOVA with hierarchal classification was used to determine the length of the EEG segment necessary to identify a statistically significant change in those EEG segments recorded during changing conditions. In 16 segments, the epoch-to-epoch variability with power spectra were computed using 2-s epochs was significantly less than the variability when power spectra were computed using longer epoch lengths. In five segments, no significant difference existed between the variance at 2-s epochs and longer (4-s) epochs. In one case, an EEG containing a burst-suppression pattern, the variability was significantly increased when 2-s epochs were used. Analysis using 2-s epochs also identified changes more rapidly than analysis using any longer epoch length in eight of nine segments, and the differences were clinically significant as well (over 30 s faster when 2-s epochs were used instead of 16-s epochs).

We suggest that there is no definite evidence to support the theory that the EEG slowing and ""activation"" are caused by hypoxia secondary to cerebral vasoconstriction induced by hypocapnia during voluntary hyperventilation. Since it is known that hypocapnia produces decreased activity in the mesencephalic reticular formation and that lesions of the thalamus abolish the hyperventilation response, we propose a strong, albeit speculative, analogy between awake-sleep transitory states and the mechanism of EEG ""activation"" by hyperventilation. Furthermore, it is proposed that both the EEG changes and the associated clinical symptomatology (as well as changes in level of anesthesia, which vary with arterial PCO2) may be explained by altered arousal, and that the vasoconstriction observed during hyperventilation is a central neurogenic response to hypocapnia at a brainstem level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3305571/

3549105,Intravenous anaesthetic agents. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships.,Clinical pharmacokinetics,1987,"Swerdlow BN, Holley FO","The number and variety of intravenous anaesthetics available has increased dramatically in recent years. In order to administer these agents safely and rationally in the operating theatre, the anaesthesiologist needs to have a detailed understanding of their dose-response behaviour. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of these anaesthetics underlie this behaviour. In understanding and applying this information, an integrated approach involving combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling has proved tremendously helpful. This approach has provided significant insight into the pharmacology of these drugs under conditions of normal and abnormal physiology. Intravenous anaesthetics may be classified as hypnotics, narcotics, or muscle relaxants. Through quantitative measures or drug effect, as provided by the electroencephalogram (EEG) in the former two classes or electromyography in the latter class, precise measures of end-organ (brain or neuromuscular junction) sensitivity have been generated using integrated modelling techniques. These values not only allow for dose potency comparisons within an anaesthetic class but, furthermore, may explain changes in drug response with ageing and disease. Incorporation within these models of an effect compartment, characterised by a rate constant for equilibration with plasma (keo), has proved to be essential in accurately describing the temporal lag between drug administration and effect. Quantitating the size of this lag has direct implications for the design of anaesthetic bolus and infusion regimens. Combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling of intravenous anaesthetics provides a precise, rational basis for the clinical use of these classes of drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3549105/

Contact thermography showed diminished temperature in the right supraorbital artery territory. The patient subsequently underwent carotid endarterectomy. Following induction of anesthesia but prior to carotid clamping, the patient became transiently hypotensive. Intraoperative EEG monitoring showed marked attenuation of the background rhythm on the right with preservation of background on the left. Normal rhythm was quickly restored with pharmacologic restoration of the blood pressure. This case illustrates the usefulness of thermography, which predicted the hemisphere in jeopardy when Dopplers and angiography showed equal bilateral disease.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3548492/
3578957,Automatic control of anesthesia using two feedback variables.,Annals of biomedical engineering,1987,"Schils GF, Sasse FJ, Rideout VC","A new controller of an ON/OFF type was implemented for halothane anesthesia. A proportional-plus-integral controller with time-delay compensation proved not to be robust enough for the known clinical situation, as shown both in computer simulations and in animal trials. The ON/OFF controller proved to be less sensitive to parameter mismatches, and repeated animal trials showed a short response time and acceptable steady-state tracking. A method for switching the controlled effect of the drug was also developed, since anesthetic agents have multiple effects. Mean arterial blood pressure and a measure of EEG frequency were chosen as controlled variables, both being depressed by halothane. A coordinator forces the system state as near the desired values of these variables as possible, given that only one drug is used.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3578957/
3772480,Role of EEG monitoring and cross-clamping duration in carotid endarterectomy.,Journal of neurosurgery,1986,"Collice M, Arena O, Fontana RA, Mola M, Galbiati N","The usefulness of electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring as well as the significance of the period of cross clamping in carotid endarterectomy have not been completely defined. In particular, the clinical importance of major EEG changes has not been fully investigated and some recent studies seem to indicate that the method has little value. As to the duration of cross clamping, there is strong evidence that occlusion times of about 15 minutes are tolerated under general anesthesia, but no information is available regarding longer periods of occlusion. The authors describe a consecutive series of 141 carotid endarterectomies in which the patients with EEG changes were shunted only when occlusion was anticipated to last longer than 30 minutes. Early major EEG changes (during the first 4 minutes) occurred in 14% of the cases. In the absence of EEG changes, long occlusion periods of 40 to 50 minutes were well tolerated. In contrast, the 20 patients with major persistent EEG changes did not tolerate protracted occlusion and three of them had immediate postoperative neurological complications. It seems that, in these circumstances, the incidence of neurological deficit is a function of the duration of cross clamping: these three patients had undergone occlusion for 15 to 30 minutes. Their deficits partially resolved. On the basis of these results it is concluded that: EEG recording is a reliable monitoring system in carotid artery cross clamping. No major strokes due to temporary carotid artery occurred in the series. The clinical significance of major persistent EEG changes is not negligible. Cross clamping for longer than 15 minutes in the presence of significant EEG alterations is potentially dangerous.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3772480/

The sedation index as well as the deceleration of EEG frequencies clearly expressed sedation following both, ketanserin and clonidine. Saliva production was significantly decreased by ketanserin (p less than 0.05) and clonidine (p less than 0.01), respectively. MAP was only very slightly reduced by ketanserin, while clonidine caused a small but significant decrease (p less than 0.0001). The pulse rate changes did not reach a clinically important extent. Thus, sedation as main central nervous system side effect and reduction in salivation as autonomic nervous system side effect of ketanserin could be clearly quantified in comparison to placebo and clonidine.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3814226/

For induction of anaesthesia, thiopental, fentanyl and pancuronium were used. The anaesthesia was maintained with enflurane 1% in nitrous oxide 67%. Moderate hypocapnia to a level averaging 4.3 kPa was achieved. The patients were divided into two groups. In Group 1 (n = 7), 1% enflurane was used throughout the anaesthesia, and CBF and CMRO2 measured about 70 min after induction averaged 30.1 ml 100 g-1 min-1 and 1.98 ml O2 100 g-1 min-1, respectively. During the second CBF study 1 h later, CBF and CMRO2 were unchanged (P greater than 0.05). In Group 2 (n = 7), the inspiratory enflurane concentration was increased from 1 to 2% after the first CBF measurement. In this group a significant decrease in CMRO2 was observed, while CBF was unchanged. In six patients EEG was recorded simultaneously with the CBF measurements. In patients subjected to increasing enflurane concentration (Group 2), a suppression in the EEG activity was observed without spike waves. It is concluded that enflurane induces a dose-related decrease in CMRO2 and suppression in the EEG activity, whereas CBF was unchanged.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3101385/

We therefore studied the acute effects of Ro 15-1788 on the ethanol-induced sedation in six healthy male subjects. Subsequently to an oral loading dose (0.54 g ethanol kg-1) ethanol was infused for 4 h (0.15 g ethanol kg-1 h-1) and steady state blood levels between 0.9 to 1.2 g l-1 were reached within 2 h. At steady state and during the elimination phase of ethanol an intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg Ro 15-1788 or placebo was administered in a randomized, double-blind crossover fashion. The marked sedative effects of ethanol as assessed by visual analogue scales (2 to 6 fold increase in the sedation index), and choice reaction time (25 to 40% prolongation) were not affected by Ro 15-1788. However, the pharmaco-EEG indicated that Ro 15-1788 seems to reverse transiently the ethanol-induced changes in total alpha, delta, and slow alpha bands. There was no pharmacokinetic interaction between both agents since elimination of Ro 15-1788 (t1/2 = 1.2 +/- 0.7 h) and of ethanol (0.17 +/- 0.02 g l-1 h-1) were in good agreement with control values. Thus, it could be concluded that Ro 15-1788 might affect for a short while the action of ethanol by interfering with the benzodiazepine receptors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3098270/

Attenuation of higher frequency activity was the most common change. Changes were moderate in 33 patients (19%) and major in 22 (12.5%). Major changes usually commenced earlier than less severe alterations. EEG changes resolved within 10 minutes of clamp release in 36 of 55 patients (65%) after an average clamp time of 36.25 minutes. Changes occurred more commonly when pre-operative EEGs were abnormal contralateral to clamping and when the contralateral carotid artery was more than 90% stenosed. Of the inhalational anesthetics employed with nitrous oxide and oxygen, isoflurane was associated with the lowest incidence of clamp-associated EEG change. Post-operative strokes occurred in 2 of 22 patients (9%) with major clamp-associated EEG changes, none of 33 patients with moderate changes and none of 121 without changes.

Parametric identification and Kalman filtering compared.,Journal of biomedical engineering,1986,"Cerutti S, Liberati D, Avanzini G, Franceschetti S, Panzica F","A procedure is described which aims to classify an EEG recorded during neurosurgery, for example intracerebral aneurysm clipping. A parametric approach is used; it employs auto-regressive (AR) modelling and Kalman filtering to quantify directly the dynamics of the EEG generating mechanism, supposing it to be a linear, time-invariant system driven by white noise. The results of this EEG processing are analysed together with simultaneous values of arterial blood pressure (ABP) as surgery of this kind is carried out under conditions of controlled hypotension. The object is to compare the sensitivity of ABP data with that obtained from the EEG and so provide an early warning of a potentially dangerous non-physiological state induced by the hypotensive drug (in this case sodium nitroprusside). Some methodological comments on the correct implementation of these algorithms are given and the procedure is compared with similar approaches which have appeared in the literature during the last few years. Particular emphasis is placed on the power spectral analysis of the signal by pointing out a method for spectral decomposition, related to AR power density estimation, which permits the separation of single spectral components in terms of central frequencies and their associated power. Other potential applications of this method are in long term EEG monitoring for the detection of changes due for example to drug infusion, to fast transient events, or to changes in the stationary condition.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3724129/

Ten normal volunteers received randomized (latin square) and at weekly intervals single oral doses of placebo, 0.05 mg, 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg Ro 17-1812 and 10 mg diazepam as reference drug. EEG recordings, psychometric tests and evaluation of pulse, blood pressure and side effects were carried out at the hours 0,1,2,3,4, and 6. Computer-assisted spectral-analysis of the EEG demonstrated after 10 mg diazepam a typical ""anxiolytic"" pharmaco-EEG profile characterized by an increase of beta activity, decrease of alpha activity and acceleration of the centroid of the total activity. Total power tended to decrease while delta activity tended to increase, although only in the resting condition. Ro 17-1812 induced in the vigilance controlled recordings a similar profile thereby exhibiting tranquilizing properties. However, in the resting condition the most consistent change was an increase of delta/theta activity along with a decrease of alpha activity, whereas only in the higher dosage range was beta activity also augmented. These data indicate a selective sedation after the novel partial agonist but are also reminiscent of changes seen after neuroleptic drugs. Dose/treatment efficacy calculations demonstrated 10 mg diazepam as the most CNS-effective drug followed closely by 0.2 mg Ro 17-1812, 0.1 and 0.05 mg while-placebo induced the least changes. Time-efficacy calculations showed a peak effect after 10 mg diazepam in the 1st hour with a gentle decline up to the 4th hour and thereafter again an increase (active metabolites), while the peak of Ro 17-1812 was consistently found in the 2nd hour with a steady decline thereafter as the encephalotropic effect in the 6th hour was less marked than in the 1st hour. Psychometric investigations showed the same time course of both compounds, with the most psychoactivity observed after 0.2 mg Ro 17-1812 and the least after placebo. The fact that the partial agonist induced more decrement in the noopsyche, but specifically in the thymopsyche, of the normal volunteers than the pure agonist may indicate a lower dependency risk of the former than the latter. Evaluation of pulse and blood pressure showed no clinically relevant findings.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3736281/

The EEG was quantitated using power spectrum analysis. Significant EEG changes were identified during all anesthetic inductions; however, the frequency of occurrence of change was significant only during development of amnesia (15 of 20 subjects, P = 0.04). The nature of the EEG changes at this time was agent-specific (P less than 0.05 by chi-square), with high-frequency changes evident in the enflurane group and shifts in amplitude in the 8-12 Hz activity predominating in the nitrous oxide-enflurane group. Anterior dominance could not be documented as a correlate of amnesia or unresponsiveness. The identification of such EEG changes may be valuable in assessing anesthetic depth, but other effects, such as the response of the EEG to surgical stimulation, must be determined before the results are clinically applicable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3717632/

A comparison with methohexitone and alfentanil for major surgery.,Anaesthesia,1986,Kay B,"In 42 patients undergoing major surgery, anaesthesia was induced by intravenous alfentanil 10 micrograms/kg together with methohexitone 1.5 mg/kg or propofol 2 mg/kg. An infusion of six times these doses per hour was then started; the rate was varied subsequently as indicated by the monitoring of arterial blood pressure, heart rate, EEG and frontalis electromyogram. The mean duration of infusion was 76.7 minutes for propofol and 74.5 minutes for methohexitone and the infusion was stopped about 10 minutes before the end of surgery in each group. The induction dose differed, but the total dose requirement for the two drugs was similar. In every case, anaesthesia was satisfactory. Methohexitone caused a significant rise in mean pulse rate throughout anaesthesia (p less than 0.05, paired t-test). There was no change in mean pulse rate during propofol infusion. The dose of alfentanil used provided excellent control of autonomic reflexes, with negligible respiratory depression. Naloxone was not required. Propofol provided better anaesthesia than methohexitone, with fewer side effects (p less than 0.05, Chi squared test), easier control of the level of narcosis and faster recovery (p less than 0.001, t-test after log transformation).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3089051/

Thiopental (4 mg/kg) was administered to a ten-patient control group. Rigidity was quantified in eight muscle groups (sternocleidomastoid, deltoid, biceps, forearm flexors, intercostal, rectus abdominus, vastus medialis/lateralis, and gastrocnemius). Marked rigidity was observed in all muscle groups in all patients receiving alfentanil and in none receiving thiopental. Central venous pressure increased with onset of rigidity, while mean arterial pressure and cardiac index remained unchanged. Manual ventilation was extremely difficult during alfentanil-induced rigidity. Arterial oxygen tension decreased more rapidly during rigidity than during the same time interval in the control group, while patients experiencing rigidity were more acidotic, as reflected by greater increases in base deficit. The EEG demonstrated an anesthetic state without seizure activity. The immediate increase in central venous pressure with the onset of rigidity, along with occasional simultaneous parallel variations in central venous pressure and the EMG, strongly suggest a mechanical mechanism for the change in central venous pressure. The metabolic changes during rigidity may be partly related to the absence of the normal cardiovascular reflexes that are reported to occur during voluntary isometric muscle contractions. A neurochemical mechanism of narcotic-induced rigidity is briefly reviewed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3008595/

Changes associated with ischemia were loss of frequency and amplitude. The results of CEM were correlated with carotid stump pressure (CSP) measurements. Only one (4%) of the 25 patients who developed an abnormal EEG had a mean CSP greater than 50 mmHg: however, CEM was positive in only 24 (45%) of the 53 patients with a CSP less than 50 mmHg. Using EEG as a standard, no CSP criterion (50 or 25 mmHg) was sufficiently sensitive and specific to recommend its routine use (50 mmHg--96% and 61% respectively; 25 mmHg--40% and 96% respectively). Operative mortality was 1%. The three intraoperative neurologic deficits (3%), one transient and two permanent, are analyzed with respect to the operative EEG findings. In the 100 endarterectomy patients and three more undergoing carotid exploration or excision of carotid body tumor EEG changes due to anesthetic problems not associated with carotid clamping were often identified. In 48 additional endarterectomies a computerized display and disk storage of six selected EEG leads, each with a reference trace for comparison, has provided information equivalent to that from the full EEG. EEG monitoring is more accurate than CSP measurement for identifying patients who require shunting, safely dispensing with a shunt in many cases which would otherwise be shunted by standard CSP criteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3949857/

Total doses were morphine, 4.4 +/- 0.71 mg/kg, fentanyl, 95.4 +/- 9.9 micrograms/kg, and sufentanil, 18.9 +/- 2.2 micrograms/kg. Comparisons among opiates included times for induction of anesthesia, return of consciousness, return of spontaneous ventilation, return of adequate cardiovascular status, and extubation. The following times (mean and SEM) were significantly (P less than 0.05) shorter for sufentanil than for fentanyl or morphine: induction (15 +/- 2.3 min, 5.9 +/- 0.7 min, and 3.0 +/- 0.2 min for morphine, fentanyl, and sufentanil, respectively); return of consciousness (morphine 109.7 +/- 34.4 min, fentanyl 62.3 +/- 17.9 min, sufentanil 17 +/- 8.7 min); return of acceptable and stable cardiovascular status (morphine 587.3 +/- 139.3 min, fentanyl 537.9 +/- 144.8 min, sufentanil 173.7 +/- 56.8 min); and extubation (morphine 1121.3 +/- 61.8 min, fentanyl 1005.7 +/- 77.7 min, sufentanil 533.3 +/- 67.8 min).

Simultaneously with the CBF measurements, blood for serum etomidate was sampled and EEG was recorded in 2-min periods in 12 patients. In 10 patients a brain biopsy for etomidate was taken peroperatively and correlated with the other data. The results indicate a dose-dependant increase in serum etomidate and brain tissue etomidate, a decrease in CMRO2 and suppression of EEG activity. In individual studies an increase in serum etomidate or a decrease in CMRO2 correlated to a suppression of the EEG activity, and vice versa. However, the wide variations in these relationships within and between patients make any conclusion regarding CMRO2 impossible from the EEG recording, infusion rate of etomidate or serum concentration of etomidate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3705903/

Twenty-four patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery (ACBS) with a history of arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease (NYHA class 3-4), and well-preserved left ventricular function were assigned randomly to either Group 1 (n = 12), who received standard premedication, or Group 2 (n = 12), who received clonidine 5 micrograms X kg-1 po in addition to standard premedication 90 min before estimated induction time. Depth of anesthesia was assessed by on-line aperiodic computerized analysis of the electroencephalogram (Lifescan EEG Monitor). Fentanyl was administered in 250-micrograms increments to shift the EEG to the 0.5-3-Hz frequency range (delta activity) in all subjects. In both groups, the anesthetic regimen effectively prevented hyperdynamic cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and intubation. No significant differences in measured or derived hemodynamic variables were observed between the two groups during the awake control period, except for stroke volume index (SVI), which was significantly greater in Group 1, 44 +/- 9 ml X beat-1 X m-2 compared with Group 2, 35 +/- 3.3 ml X beat-1 X m-2 (P less than 0.05). By contrast, fentanyl requirements in Group 2 were significantly reduced by 45% when compared with Group 1, i.e., from 110 +/- 23 to 61 +/- 19 micrograms X kg-1 (P less than 0.001). The authors conclude that at a similar anesthetic depth, as assessed by the EEG shift into the lower frequency range (0.5-3 Hz), a markedly reduced fentanyl dose effectively prevented the hyperdynamic cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and intubation in the group of patients premedicated with clonidine.

The present study investigated CNS effects of ketanserin, a newly developed S2-serotonergic antagonist, in hypertensive patients. A multidimensional research strategy was used combining pharmaco-EEG and pharmacopsychological methods. The investigation consisted of two separate double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled studies, which were, however, planned together and in part included the same patients. The first study was carried out in 2 X 24 patients receiving chronic treatment with 2 X 20 mg ketanserin for 2 weeks, followed by 2 X 40 mg for a further 3 weeks. The second study was performed in 2 X 20 patients after subacute administration of 20 mg twice daily for six days. A multidimensional research strategy was employed to investigate CNS effects on functional and performance measures. Vigilance-related parameters, such as the alpha slow wave index and the absolute delta power, were assessed with pharmaco electroencephalography. Critical flicker-fusion frequency served as a measure of central sedation. Psychomotor performance and concentration tests were used to detect CNS effects which might impair car-driving ability. In addition, subjective well-being and adverse drug reactions were recorded. Ketanserin proved to be a safe drug to lower blood pressure. Only after chronic treatment were there slight indications that ketanserin could have a sedating and inhibiting action on the CNS. However, the differences between placebo and the ketanserin group, and the alterations within each group, were so minimal that they were not considered clinically relevant. A negative effect of ketanserin on car-driving ability is not very likely.

The alfentanil-induced muscle rigidity exerted a noticeable effect on the EEG, with a moderate effect on total power at 1 Hz; a marked effect on the total number of waves, cumulative percent power at 3 Hz, and average power at 17 to 19 Hz; and a striking effect on F90, the frequency below which 90% of the power resides. The presence of electromyographic (EMG) noise in the EEG consistently altered the variables derived from the EEG, so that anesthetic depth appeared less than it actually was. This was true in spite of the fact that we gave slightly more alfentanil in the group not receiving a relaxant. Although the observed muscle activity was greater than that usually seen clinically, and may have differed qualitatively, the results do serve as a warning that muscle noise can interfere with the EEG. Currently, there is no computerized technique that will reject or account for this noise, and we must depend on observation to recognize the EMG patterns within the EEG, either with the raw recording or with a detailed analysis (such as aperiodic analysis), and to compensate for this noise if possible. Techniques that average the EEG or that present a single number have difficulty providing this information. These results do not detract from the usefulness of the EMG contained in EEG recordings as a supplementary or complementary indicator of anesthetic lightness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2872279/

Carotid artery stump pressure was measured and EEG changes noted; however, neither low stump pressure nor EEG changes influenced the decision for shunt insertion. A shunt was only used if a neurologic deficit developed during carotid clamping. A total of 134 carotid endarterectomies were done in 121 patients. Sixty-six patients were men and 55 were women with ages ranging from 41 to 88 years. Indications included transient ischemic attacks in 57 (43%), prior stroke in 25 (19%), vertebrobasilar symptoms in nine (6%), and asymptomatic patients with high-grade stenosis, 43 (32%). Thirteen patients (9.7%) developed neurologic deficits following carotid clamping and had shunts inserted. All deficits cleared following shunt insertion. Nine of the 13 had EEG changes, but in four, EEGs were unchanged despite the occurrence of clear-cut neurologic changes. Stump pressure in the 13 patients ranged from 14 to 78 mm Hg. Ten were greater than 24 mm Hg and three were more than 50 mm Hg. In 121 operations no neurologic deficits occurred during carotid clamping and no shunts were inserted. In 13 of these operations, significant EEG changes were noted. Stump pressures in these 13 with EEG changes ranged from 15 to 120 mm Hg. In seven, stump pressure was greater than 50 mm Hg. There were no deaths in the series. Two (1.5%) temporary and one (0.7%) permanent postoperative deficits occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4057434/

4025886,The effect of high dose sodium thiopental on brain stem auditory and median nerve somatosensory evoked responses in humans.,Anesthesiology,1985,"Drummond JC, Todd MM, U HS","Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (MnSSEPs), brain stem auditory evoked responses (BAERs), and the cortical electro-encephalogram (EEG) were recorded in six patients during a 62-min infusion of sodium thiopental (STP) at a rate of 1.25 mg X kg-1 X min-1 (total dose, 77.5 mg/kg). The EEG became isoelectric after 22 +/- 8 (SD) min of STP infusion. Dose-related changes in the latencies and amplitudes of various evoked response wave forms were observed. However, in no instance was any component of either the MnSSEP or the BAER rendered unobtainable by STP administration. For the MnSSEP, progressive increases in the central conduction time (5.33 +/- 0.41 ms preinduction vs. 7.46 +/- 1.2 ms at t = 60 min) and in the latency of the cortical primary specific complex were observed simultaneously with significant reductions in the amplitude of the latter (2.10 +/- 0.85 muV preinduction vs. 0.85 +/- 0.55 muV at t = 60 min). Changes in the latency and amplitude of the response recorded over the upper cervical spine (C2) were not statistically significant in this small population. For the BAER, progressive and significant increases in the latencies of Waves I, III, V (e.g., Wave V latency: 6.16 +/- 0.24 vs. 6.87 +/- 0.31 ms) and in the I-III, III-V, and the I-V interwave latencies were observed. The amplitudes of the BAER components were not significantly altered. The authors conclude that the administration of a dose of STP in excess of twice that required to produce EEG isoelectricity can be compatible with effective monitoring of MnSSEPs and BAERs. However, STP produces dose-related changes in both evoked response wave forms, which must be considered in the interpretation of responses elicited during STP anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4025886/

Hypnotic steady-state concentrations of midazolam (55 +/- 11 ng/mL; mean +/- SD) have been achieved rapidly by an intravenous bolus of 0.07 mg/kg and maintained by an individual but constant infusion rate of 0.025 to 0.04 mg/kg/hr for eight hours. Following a two-hour control period, the antagonist (2.5 mg) or the solvent were injected double-blind in random order. Three hours later, the other medication was administered. Whereas plasma levels of midazolam remained constant throughout the complete eight-hour trial (Clearance = 670 +/- 96 mL/min) concentrations of Ro 15-1788 declined rapidly with an elimination half-life between 0.7 and 1.8 hours and a total plasma clearance of 702 +/- 235 mL/min. Concentrations of Ro 15-1788 approached the analytic limit of 2 ng/mL within three hours. The pharmacodynamic response to midazolam and the antagonist was assessed by a sedation index using visual analogue scales, reaction time (RT) measurements, and transformed Fourier analysis of the power spectrum of the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG). About 30 to 45 seconds following the injection of Ro 15-1788, hypnotic action of midazolam was completely reversed as visualized by return to alpha rhythm in the EEG, shortening of prolonged RT, and normalization of the elevated sedation index. The antagonistic action lasted for about two to three hours.

Patients were studied with double-blind random assignment to placebo or drug and were assessed at baseline, day 7, and day 14 with EEG and Hamilton Anxiety Ratings. Ten age- and sex-matched normal controls were also tested. Hamilton Anxiety Ratings were decreased significantly more in the drug group than in the placebo group. Topographic maps of EEG activity revealed decreases in occipital alpha and parietal delta, together with increases in posterior frontal (central EEG leads) and parietal beta. Decreases in delta are consistent with a lack of sedation; the reciprocal beta increases in parietal cortex are similarly consistent. This pattern of regional EEG changes in the direction of alert attentiveness, together with individual differences, observed in frontal/parietal and occipital alpha activity, suggests the importance of at least these two cortical regions for anxiolytic action. Differences between patients with generalized anxiety disorder and normals were restricted to the occipital and temporal regions. These results suggest the importance of multilead recording in assessing EEG correlates of drug action.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2862924/

The infusions were stopped when a deep hypnotic state was obtained, as indicated by burst suppressions in the EEG. The infusions were restarted when the volunteers were fully orientated to person, place and time. The mean (+/-SD) doses of etomidate delivered by the first, second and third infusion were 165 +/- 30, 137 +/- 25 and 157 +/- 26 mg, respectively. Certain clinical signs were observed and related to the plasma concentrations of etomidate. Pharmacokinetic analysis was undertaken using an open two-compartment model. The therapeutic window was in a range of plasma concentrations between 0.3 and 1.0 microgram ml-1 of etomidate. Pharmacokinetic analysis gave a volume for the central compartment of 50 +/- 11 litre, an apparent volume of distribution of 252 +/- 51 litre and a total clearance of 1693 +/- 504 ml min-1. Microprocessor controlled infusions can serve as a powerful tool for research in clinical pharmacology.

4003792,The effect of increasing age on thiopental disposition and anesthetic requirement.,Anesthesiology,1985,"Homer TD, Stanski DR","The dose of thiopental required to induce anesthesia in adults decreases with age. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of thiopental were studied in two groups of surgical patients to determine the mechanism of this decrease. In one group (29 patients 19-88 yr of age), thiopental was infused at a rate of 75-150 mg/min until the electroencephalogram (EEG) demonstrated early burst suppression (phase III). Arterial blood samples were obtained frequently during and after the infusion to measure serum thiopental concentrations, and power spectral analysis was used to calculate the spectral edge (Hz), defined as the frequency below which 95% of the EEG power is located. Pharmacodynamic modeling was used to relate the serum thiopental concentrations to the spectral edge in order to estimate the individual patient's brain sensitivity to thiopental. In a second group (28 patients 24-88 yr of age), pharmacokinetics were determined after a bolus or rapid infusion of thiopental. Arterial blood samples were obtained frequently to characterize the initial distribution phases, sampling continued for 24-48 h to characterize elimination processes. The dose of thiopental required to achieve early burst suppression on the electroencephalogram (EEG) decreased linearly and significantly with age. Pharmacodynamic modeling also demonstrated that brain sensitivity to thiopental does not change with age. The age-related decrease of the thiopental dose requirement is due to a change in the initial distribution of the drug. That is, the initial distribution volume (central compartment, or V1) of thiopental decreases exponentially with age. This smaller initial distribution volume in the elderly results in higher serum levels after a given dose of thiopental.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4003792/

No change in EEG or clinical status was seen with occlusion of the carotid artery, but generalized encephalopathic changes were seen after a small dose of narcotic given before carotid occlusion. Bihemispheric changes in EEG and neurological status occurred upon release of carotid occlusion. This case demonstrates three important points. First, EEG changes can be seen with sedative or anaesthetic agents in patients who have previously suffered brain injury. Second, temporary neural dysfunction may be seen remote from the site of a localized injury to the brain--a phenomenon known as diaschisis. Finally, this report reiterates the observation that the risk of injury to the brain during carotid endarterectomy is not limited to the period of possible ischaemia during occlusion of the carotid artery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3986074/

ZBPR analysis was found to be much more sensitive than conventional spectral analyses for detecting differences between the study groups. Significant differences occurred between the general anaesthesia group and the epidural and control groups and also between the spinal group and the epidural and control groups. No significant difference was seen between the epidural group and the control group. Significant differences were attributed to the clinical use of two drugs: thiopentone in the general anaesthesia group and ephedrine in the spinal group.

Morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and scopolamine (0.4 mg) were used for premedication. Crystalloid (500 ml) was administered before induction, and nitroglycerin (0.3 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) was infused during the study. Fentanyl, 15 or 60 micrograms/kg, was administered at a rate of 1.2 micrograms X kg-1 X sec-1. Pancuronium (0.04 mg/kg) and metocurine (0.16 mg/kg) were used for muscle relaxation. Data were collected 2 min before induction (baseline), before intubation (3 min), at 6 min, and at 13 min. Responses to 15 and 60 micrograms/kg were similar. At 3 min the heart rate (HR) in patients given 15 micrograms/kg increased by 6; whereas the HR in those given 60 micrograms/kg increased by 14 (P less than 0.01). Subsequent differences in HR were not significant. There were no dose-related differences in mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, central venous pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The EEG showed high-voltage low-frequency activity within 2 min in all patients. Arterial plasma fentanyl concentrations at 3 min averaged 25.9 +/- 3.8 ng/ml with 15 micrograms/kg and 89.9 +/- 15.2 ng/ml with 60 micrograms/kg. At 4 hr, plasma concentrations averaged 0.4 +/- 0.2 ng/ml and 3.6 +/- 0.7 ng/ml, respectively.

The pharmacokinetic profiles for the individual isomers of ketamine did not differ significantly from the racemic mixture. Even though the apparent anaesthetic state produced in these healthy volunteers did not differ qualitatively between the three drug groups, recovery times (assessed using a standardized battery of psychometric tests) were consistently shorter following the individual isomers compared with the racemic mixture. The serum ketamine concentrations associated with regaining consciousness and orientation were consistent with an S(+):R(-) isomer potency ratio of 4:1. In terms of their ability to impair psychomotor function, the S(+):R(-) potency ratio varied from 3:1 to 5:1.

This device derives both these measures from a single electrode pair that is typically placed on the mid-forehead and mastoid process. The evaluation consisted of 1) quantifying the zero-crossing frequency (ZXF) of the EEG and mean integrated voltage of both measures (MIVEEG and MIVEMG) that occurred during induction and emergence from general anesthesia in 17 patients and 2) case reports sampled from an additional 41 patients. Alone or combined, variations in these parameters did not consistently accompany changes in the depth or adequacy of anesthesia as determined by standard clinical signs (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, movement). Interpatient variability in the EEG measures during recovery from anesthesia was so large that neither the absolute value of ZXF nor that of MIVEEG could discriminate between moderate (i.e., maintenance) and light (i.e., emergence) anesthesia. Although MIVEMG uniformly decreased in anesthetized, unparalyzed patients (compared to the pre-operative awake state), noticeable increases during recovery often did not occur until limb movement was observed. Additionally, the common use of neuromuscular blockers made interpretation of low MIVEMG values quite difficult during anesthesia maintenance. However, selected individual case reports illustrated the potential benefit of routine intraoperative, microprocessor-based EEG/EMG monitoring. The single channel EEG/EMG display of the ABM seems sufficient to warn the anesthesiologist of pathologic decreases in cerebral electrical activity. Marked depression of cerebral function is associated with accidental anesthetic overdose, hypoxia or global ischemia. Additionally, the device should be useful for monitoring burst-suppression or isoelectric EEG patterns intentionally produced during barbiturate or isoflurane coma for cerebral protection.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3836284/

Thirty-eight (51.4%) patients presented TIA's or non hemispheric symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency; 30 (40.5%) were asymptomatic and 6 (8.1%) had partial nonprogressing or fixed strokes. All operations were performed under general anesthesia, with pharmacologic hypertension and systemic heparinization; in all cases, continuous EEG monitoring and 'stump pressure' measurement were employed. The operation was performed without a temporary intraluminal shunt in the patients showing tolerance to carotid clamping. The protection of the shunt was required only in patients with EEG monitoring changes (17). All carotid arteriotomies were extended into the internal carotid artery to overpass the end of the endarterectomy. Overpass was also used in the proximal edge of the arteriotomy, in the common carotid artery. The distal intima was never fixed with stitches and the arteriotomy was routinely closed with a PTFE patch graft angioplasty. Early results of cerebral protection were excellent. No patient presented permanent or transient postoperative neurological problems and no patient died in the postoperative period for causes related to the operation. This is substantiated by results we achieved during the period 1970-1979 in 192 patients, when all carotid endarterectomies were routinely performed without a shunt, with figures of 2.5% of postoperative stroke and 1.5% of mortality. Longterm follow-up (from 6 to 36 months) was completed in 51 patients (60 operations).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6390793/

In 11 patients, in whom the end-expiratory CO2 concentration and evoked mechanical response were recorded, increasing curarization caused first a slow CO2 accumulation and later an abrupt ventilatory impairment at a twitch tension of between 5 and 50% of original muscle strength. In 12 patients, in whom the evoked integrated hypothenar EMG, spontaneous frontal EMG and mean frequency and amplitude of the EEG were recorded, the spontaneous frontal EMG and ventilation diminished within 3 min, following the first 5 mg dose of tubocurarine. At this stage muscle strength, indicated by the amplitude of the evoked EMG and the train-of-four ratio, was unchanged. Repeated 5 mg doses of tubocurarine caused an almost linear decrease in ventilation and an increase in end-tidal CO2 concentration without affecting the rate of breathing until the sudden impairment of ventilation that occurred usually after the fourth dose of tubocurarine. The EEG changes during curarization were minimal and no common trend was seen. The results suggest that tubocurarine may be given to anaesthetized patients in a dose which is too small to produce, using the evoked EMG, a detectable neuromuscular block, but is sufficient to cause ventilatory depression without a compensatory increase in the rate of breathing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6443090/
6711855,Intraoperative EEG patterns: implications for EEG monitoring.,Anesthesiology,1984,Levy WJ,"Univariate descriptors such as the mean frequency and spectral edge frequency have been proposed for intraoperative representation of the EEG. Such univariate descriptors of the EEG are accurate only when the EEG behaves as a unimodal distribution of frequencies that change slowly with time. EEGs were recorded from 64 patients undergoing anesthetic inductions and 30 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass to determine the characteristics of the observed distribution of frequencies. Multimodal EEG activity was observed in 64% of these cases, including 83% of those patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. The differences between the two peaks averaged 7.6 Hz, and the average ratio of the power of the peaks to the intervening valley was 2.5:1 and 1.9:1. Calculations of mean frequency and spectral edge frequency failed to adequately reflect the complexity of the EEG in these cases. Burst-suppression activity was observed in 26% of cases during cardiopulmonary bypass, and averaging over time destroyed the characteristic pattern. Thus, univariate descriptors of the EEG appear inadequate to describe the behavior of EEG during anesthesia in a large percentage of cases.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6711855/

Power spectral analysis was used to calculate the spectral edge, a measure of the underlying EEG frequency that characterizes the progressive slowing of the EEG induced by thiopental. Eight male volunteer subjects had venous thiopental serum concentrations measured, and 10 surgical patients had arterial serum concentrations measured. Thiopental was infused at a rate of 75 to 150 mg/min until a burst suppression EEG pattern was evident. Frequent blood samples were obtained during and after the infusion for measurement of serum thiopental concentrations, and the EEG was recorded for subsequent off-line power spectral analysis to calculate the spectral edge. With venous blood sampling, it was not possible to demonstrate significant hysteresis between the thiopental serum concentration and the spectral edge, allowing thiopental concentrations to be directly related to the spectral edge. With arterial blood sampling, significant hysteresis was present, requiring an effect compartment to relate concentration to effect. The half-time for equilibration (mean +/- SD) between concentration and response for the arterial data was 1.2 +/- 0.30 min. This value for Keo is consistent with known values for cerebral blood flow and thiopental brain: blood partition coefficient. Arterial-venous concentration differences cause the apparent lack of hysteresis with venous blood sampling. An inhibitory sigmoid Emax pharmacodynamic model optimally characterized the relationship between thiopental concentrations and the spectral edge. This model allows estimation of the thiopental serum concentration that causes one-half of the maximal EEG slowing (IC50), which is a measure of an individual's sensitivity to thiopental. Except for the hysteresis, there was no statistical difference in the parameters of the inhibitory sigmoid Emax pharmacodynamic model when venous and arterial blood samplings were compared.

Supplementum,1984,Doenicke A,"Over the last 20 years standardized techniques have been employed for the investigation of intravenous hypnotics, psychotropic and neuroleptic drugs. Sleep has been studied with the help of EEG measures and side-effects have been evaluated by psychometric tests. The EEG is a proven parameter with regard to dosage determination and as objective means to find sleep-inducing quantities of drugs. By means of vigilosomnograms we have established dose-effect curves and have made comparisons between related drugs in the form of equivalence studies. From an anaesthesiological point of view controllability of a substance is determined by duration of effect (short- or long-acting) and by depth of sleep (light or deep states) achieved. By these criteria midazolam displays good controllability with regard to duration, but not in terms of depth of sleep, since it follows the ""all-or-nothing"" rule, even with 0.1 mg/kg following both intravenous or intramuscular injection. Lormetazepam, on the other hand, shows good controllability of depth of sleep from tranquillity via sedation to hypnosis, but duration of effect is less well controllable in that patients remain lightly asleep even after 2 h. According to the vigilosomnograms the lormetazepam/oxygen/nitrous oxide combination produced a super-added increase in the depth of the hypnotic effect. After droperidol the specific nitrous oxide component of the depth of sleep at Bo stage was not exceeded.

6147192,Pinazepam: review of pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy.,Clinical therapeutics,1984,Janbroers JM,"Pinazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, differs from other drugs of its class by the presence of an unsaturated bond, the propargyl group, at the N-1 position. Its toxicity is less than that of diazepam. In animals, pinazepam controls anxiety and aggressiveness. This effect seems to be associated with a particularly low hypnotic effect and with a limited impairment of motor coordination. Pinazepam shows less cortical activity at the anxiolytic level than does diazepam on EEG. The drug's mechanism of action primarily involves modification in the region of the limbic system. Extensive pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated rapid gastrointestinal absorption of pinazepam. The metabolic pathway is N-1 dealkylation and C-3 hydroxylation. In dogs, pinazepam reaches the steady state in one day and its main metabolite, depropargylpinazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam) in six days, thus achieving a much higher blood concentration than the parent drug. In rabbits, a first-pass effect is evident. Both compounds are converted to oxazepam, which is pharmacologically inactive and is eliminated in the urine. Pinazepam and depropargylpinazepam cross the placenta and appear in human milk. In dogs, accumulation could not be demonstrated at the end of treatment with 10 mg of pinazepam for 20 days. All the findings in animals were confirmed in humans. In clinical trials with open or controlled design, pinazepam, compared with diazepam, showed a significant and purely anxiolytic action in patients suffering from anxiety with or without somatic manifestations, particularly in gastrointestinal disorders. Even though it is not a specific hypnotic drug, it seems to help patients in whom the physiological course of the sleep is disturbed. The standard dosage is 10 mg daily, divided in two doses. Pinazepam is well tolerated in humans. About 5% of patients experience mild sedation. Other side effects are infrequent and minor. In the studies there was no evidence of impairment of motor coordination or of intellectual performance. There were no reports of a rebound phenomenon or drug dependence. These findings indicate that pinazepam is a pure anxiolytic agent devoid of hypnotic effect or motor disorders, characteristics that make it a useful drug for daytime use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6147192/

Concept and performance.,Acta anaesthesiologica Belgica,1984,Kay B,"Three integral components of the ABM, the frontalis electromyogram (EMG), the processed unipolar electroencephalogram (EEG) and the neuromuscular transmission monitor (NMT) were compared with standard research methods, and their clinical utility indicated. The EMG was compared with the method of Dundee et al (2) for measuring the induction dose of thiopentone; the EEG was compared with the SLE Galileo E8-b and the NMT was compared with the Medelec MS6. In each case correlation of results was extremely high, and the ABM offered some advantages over the standard research methods. We conclude that each of the integral units of the ABM is simple to apply and interpret, yet as accurate as standard apparatus used for research. In addition the ABM offers excellent display and recording facilities and alarm systems.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6097082/

A new microprocessor-based device for the on-line analysis of the EEG and evoked potentials.,British journal of anaesthesia,1983,"Sebel PS, Maynard DE, Major E, Frank M","A description is given of a new microprocessor-based device for EEG analysis. The Cerebral Function Analysing Monitor (CFAM) analyses the EEG amplitude and frequency distribution. It produces a detailed plot of amplitude trends and separate traces of the percentage activity in each of the classical EEG frequency bands. Its clinical application was studied in five patients anaesthetized with thiopentone, and nitrous oxide and halothane in oxygen. During maintenance of anaesthesia, there was a gradual decrease in EEG amplitude and shift towards lower frequency EEG activity. Discontinuation of nitrous oxide resulted in a marked increase in EEG amplitude and an increase in alpha and beta band activity. Discontinuation of halothane resulted in smaller alterations in the CFAM trace. This device provides easily interpreted processed EEG data and merits further investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6652016/

The patients were divided into two groups according to the depth of anesthesia. Cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained above 60 mmHg with phenylephrine. In Group 1 (arterial enflurane concentration, 15 mg/dl), patients were studied before surgery, while in group 2 (enflurane concentration, 27 mg/dl), the measurements were performed before and during surgery. In Group 1, mean CBF and CMRO2 were 53 and 2.8 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1, respectively. These values were not significantly different from CBF (46 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1) and CMRO2 (3.1 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1) values previously obtained in awake patients. In Group 2 before surgery, mean CBF and CMRO2 were 61 and 2.6 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1, respectively, and were significantly different from the awake values, while the EEG showed frequent spikes and suppression. In Group 2 during surgery, mean CBF and CMRO2 did not differ from the values obtained before surgery, despite significant EEG changes. The results indicate that enflurane is a cerebral vasodilator and causes an increase in CBF and a decrease in CMRO2 in humans at an anesthetic level characterized by frequent spikes and suppression on the EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6650909/

The arterial and venous thiopental concentrations were similar with no evidence of a sustained arterial-venous gradient. The average arterial concentration was 20.1 microgram X ml-1 +/- 10 (SD) at 2 min after thiopental, and fell rapidly to 13.0 micrograms X ml-1 +/- 3.2 at 5 min, 10.7 micrograms X ml-1 +/- 4.4 at 10 min and 6.2 micrograms X ml-1 at 30 min. After thiopental the EEG record showed an increase in delta activity and in four patients a burst suppression pattern was seen. The duration of burst suppression activity was variable (130 to 367 seconds) but in all instances cortical activity had returned to the pre-thiopental level by five to ten minutes. Thus concentrations of thiopental of 10-30 micrograms X ml-1 were associated with EEG burst suppression and both were seen only within the first five minutes after drug administration. In contrast the carotid artery was occluded for considerably longer (26 +/- 4) minutes. We conclude that, since there was no sustained arterial-venous gradient, either arterial or venous concentrations are adequate for the study of thiopental pharmacokinetics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6640398/

No differences were observed between the two groups with regard to the frequency of amnesia, psychomotor impairment, or EEG changes during a period of 4 h. The only significant difference in the level of sedation between the two groups was observed 60 min into the study. This difference is attributed to the high incidence of nausea and vomiting that occurred at that time exclusively in one group. Time to complete recovery was the same in both groups. However, physostigmine, not saline, was associated with a high incidence of muscarinic and sympathetic stimulating effects.

Because of its reflection of the physiologic state of the end organ, the authors chose routine 18 lead EEG monitoring as a guide to selective shunting and as an indication of adequate shunt function during all carotid endarterectomies performed from December 1977 through July 1982. In that period, 200 patients underwent 219 endarterectomies under general anesthesia and EEG monitoring. Ischemic EEG changes at the time of carotid cross clamping suggested the need for intraluminal shunts in 16% of patients. Insertion of shunts restored the EEG pattern to normal in all instances, although in two patients, adjustment of the shunt was required to maintain this results. EEG changes requiring shunting occurred in 10% of patients with unilateral disease, in 27% of patients with bilateral disease, and in 42% of patients with unilateral stenosis and contralateral occlusion. Twenty-seven patients had small fixed neurologic deficits before operation. Surgery was not delayed in these individuals who demonstrated no increased requirement for shunts and no new postoperative neurologic deficits. In the group of 150 endarterectomies performed as separate procedures, there was one (0.7%) fixed neurologic deficit after operation, one transient deficit (0.7%), and one death (0.7%). Sixty-nine endarterectomies were performed simultaneously with open heart surgery and were associated with one fixed neurologic deficit (1.4%) and two transient deficits (2.9%). All four deaths in this group were attributable to the cardiac surgical procedures. These results indicate that selective shunting based on EEG monitoring permits the safe performance of carotid endarterectomy, even in patients considered to be at high risk for postoperative neurologic deficit.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6859980/

Maintenance of anesthesia consisted of 20 micrograms/kg of alfentanil given every 15 min and 20 micrograms/kg/min of etomidate given over an infusion. The patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated with pure oxygen. In order to access the state of vigilance with respect to etomidate and alfentanil plasma levels, EEG power spectra were computed from electrical cortical activity of the occipital region (P3-O1); respectively venous blood samples were assayed by means of gas chromatography for alfentanil and etomidate plasma concentration. In the EEG power spectrum, anesthesia replaced the high dominant alpha-peaks of the control-awake period by a disharmonious pattern over the whole frequency range (0.5-16.0 Hz). At the end of anesthesia vigilance recording indicated a correlation with plasma etomidate level. Once concentration had dropped below 100 ng/ml power spectra were characterized by a stable harmonious peak in the alpha-range (8.0-10.0 Hz). Plasma levels above 100 ng/ml induced a fluctuating pattern with peaks in the theta to delta band (0.5-8.0 Hz); the latter was characterized by drowsiness and a reduced respiratory drive. Opioid plasma levels above 100 ng/ml with etomidate levels below 80 ng/ml did not influence to the same extent. EEG power spectra seem to be a useful tool in pinpointing to a reduced state of vigilance.

The CPS provides suitably precise data for quantification and statistical inference compared to the qualitative evaluation of EGG when interpreted by clinicians or researchers. In the past decade, the CPS has been applied to the studies of cognitive functions, memory, psi phenomena, speech laterality, and states of consciousness including coma, sleep, anesthesia, pathophysiology and pain state. However, few systematic evaluations of CPS methodology have been reported, rendering cross-laboratory comparisons difficult and external validity of experimental results uncertain. This report first describes a calibration procedure employing a microcomputer system for measuring the functional relationship between input signals and output cortical powers. Second, we examine controlled behavioral artifact effects on the CPS.

In one study, auditory vigilance and tapping rates improved after d-amphetamine, 5 and 10 mg; were impaired by amitriptyline, 25 mg; but were unaffected by bupropion, 50 and 100 mg. Subjects were drowsy after amitriptyline and more alert and sociable after d-amphetamine; no such changes occurred with bupropion. No changes in pupil size, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure were seen with bupropion. In a second study bupropion, 200 mg, and nomifensine, 100 mg, produced no significant behavioral or autonomic effects. EEG changes occurred after amitriptyline and d-amphetamine but not bupropion. Thus, bupropion at these doses lacked stimulant, anticholinergic, and cardiovascular effects. Bupropion's interactions with diazepam and with alcohol were examined in separate studies. Diazepam, 5 and 2.5 mg, produced drowsiness and impaired auditory vigilance. Bupropion, 100 mg, produced no effect alone but, combined with diazepam, abolished the vigilance impairment and drowsiness seen with diazepam, 2.5 and 5 mg, alone. A similar but less clear-cut pattern was seen with alcohol.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) and visual evoked potentials (VEP) were recorded and behaviour was observed over not less than 5-7 hr after subconvulsive doses of R 5135. Doses of 2-4 mg/kg of the compound produced quasi-rhythmic spikes resembling experimental focal epileptic discharges in all rats. This epileptiform activity was accompanied by behavioural sedation and somnolence, followed by a build-up of stereotyped behaviour and sporadic episodes of epileptiform motor activity, developing 1-2 hr after injection. The secondary components (SNW) of the visual evoked potentials were suppressed by R 5135 and the primary potential (N1) facilitated, virtually reducing the visual evoked potential to the form of an evoked spike. Pretreatment with the anticonvulsant GABAergic drugs gamma-acetylenic GABA (GAG) (100 mg/kg), sodium valproate (VPA) (400 mg/kg) and diazepam (5 mg/kg) suppressed the motor components of seizure activity, producing severe ataxia, but not the electrographic manifestation of seizure activity. Neither gamma-acetylenic GABA nor valproate significantly altered the latency to onset of spiking, although all three drugs did significantly reduce the frequency of discharges. Diazepam was the only anticonvulsant tested which completely suppressed spike activity in 3 of 5 rats. Moreover, R 5135 was found to antagonize diazepam, but not valproate induced suppression of secondary components of the visual evoked potential, suggesting that diazepam and R 5135 may compete for the same receptor.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6403888/

Interpretation of the change was simplified by the use of the compressed spectral analysis or PSA-1. Quantification of the change was aided by use of the PSA-1, and the graphic output form of this instrument minimized user error. Also, it provided the needed information to those members of the operative team not skilled in EEG interpretation. No immediate postoperative deficits were missed by the monitoring technique. There were no postoperative deficits upon awakening in the 138 patients without processed EEG change. Shunt placement, depth of anesthesia, and intraoperative blood pressure levels were accurately guided throughout the operative procedure by these monitoring techniques. Accurate documentation of an acute significant change permits prompt treatment for restoration of necessary collateral flow. The monitoring technique described continuously provides information for efficacy of treatment. Attention to blood pressure level, which seems to passively determine cerebral collateral flow during clamping, was a very important clinically manipulable variable. Manipulation of this variable with processed EEG control may prove efficacious not only in patients undergoing carotid procedures but in nonsurgical cases of acute carotid occlusion or middle cerebral stem occlusion. Manipulation of identifiable critical variables has a positive impact on the clinical outcome when continuous monitoring is employed. The detection of hemispheric low flow in 34 patients during the preclamp, clamp, and postclamp periods suggests that shunting will not prevent all low flow deficits. Finally, perfection of surgical therapy for stroke prevention necessitates detection and treatment of hemispheric low flow.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6849187/

This applies especially to anesthesiology which involves numerous procedures leading to a temporary loss of cognitive brain function. Recently, the application of EEG combined with spectral analysis performed during anesthesia and intensive-care treatment has attracted attention: we investigated the changes in EEG during standardized anesthesiological and therapeutical procedures pre-, intra- and postoperatively, or during intensive-care treatment in 1,500 patients undergoing general surgery from 1977 to 1982. Two-track EEG leads accompanied by spectral analysis were used on line. The evaluation of routinely applied EEG monitoring justifies the following statements: EEG monitoring can be adapted technically and organized to comply with the working conditions and daily activities of an anesthesiological department. Spectral analytic representations allow the assessment of the EEG by the anesthesiologist. The various methods of general anesthesia produce specific EEG changes which can be obliterated by the cumulative effect of drugs. The actual depth of anesthesia is visible in the EEG. During a defined constant anesthetic depth, potentially hazardous cerebral dysfunctions can be detected early and treated accordingly.

Cortical resections are more likely to accomplish this than other surgical alternatives for epilepsy. Although abnormalities on new imaging techniques (CT, positron emission scanning) aid in identifying the epileptic focus, interictal epileptiform EEG changes remain the main indicator of focal origin of the seizures. Where this is equivocal, direct brain recording of spontaneous seizures with subdural electrodes is of value in identifying the side and lobe of seizure onset. The cortical resection is then tailored by the extent of the interictal electrocorticographic abnormalities and functional identification of essential areas such as those for language, using an electrical stimulation mapping technique, under local anesthesia. With this approach, half of the patients with temporal lobe foci are seizure-free since the time of operation, over two-thirds become so with time, and over three-quarters have at least very major reductions in seizure frequency.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6670862/

We define dosing rules for a loading dose followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of morphine sulfate to achieve a serum morphine concentration of 75 micrograms/L. This concentration is well above the minimum serum morphine concentration of 50 micrograms/L for moderate analgesic effects in adults. It also exceeds the concentration of 65 micrograms/L claimed to provide adequate analgesia in children during surgery. The clearance of morphine in 8 children between 0 and 5 yr of age was 20.5 +/- 2.8 mL/kg/min (means +/- SD). This result is threefold larger than the clearance value obtained after a single intravenous dose and 1.5 times greater than clearance values found after multiple intravenous doses of morphine, previously reported by others in children between the ages of 1 and 15 yr. Having established a dosing regimen that achieves a steady-state serum morphine concentration of approximately 75 micrograms/L, we plan to investigate the relationship between morphine serum concentration and pharmacologic effect. Intraoperatively the action of morphine at its receptor site will be assessed according to a scoring system including EEG changes, heart rate, blood pressure, response to sensory stimuli, and maintenance of vital functions. The effect of intravenous morphine will further be estimated according to the postanesthetic scoring system described in this report.

The most practical noninvasive method of studying patients for cerebrovascular disease in our laboratory has been oculopneumoplethysmography and B-mode scanning. Interobserver variations in interpretation of arteriography make measurement of the percentage of stenosis an unacceptable standard for judging the accuracy of other diagnostic techniques. Endarterectomy with local or general anesthesia with the routine use of a shunt or EEG monitoring is satisfactory and useful.

After fast absorption dose-dependent plasma level peaks could be determined 2 hours after administration. Applying an open two-compartment body model the drug was excreted with an elimination half-life of 10.3 hours. EEG power reached maximum changes after 1 hour in the delta, theta, alpha 2 and beta 1 frequency bands, as well as in the dominant alpha-frequency, and declined after that with different speeds to previous levels. Three to five hours after drug administration no significant changes could be detected. Vigilance sensitive EEG changes (delta, alpha 2) diminished earlier than indicated by plasma level half-lives. In contrast the decline of relative beta-power parallels plasma level time courses more closely under the 3 mg dose.

7045557,Catecholamines and the sleep-wake cycle. I. EEG and behavioral arousal.,Life sciences,1982,Monti JM,"The exact role of catecholamines (CA) on the sleep-wake cycle is still controversial. Critical analysis of lesion studies tends to suggest a neuromodulatory role for both dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) on EEG and behavioral arousal. Support for this view is provided by pharmacological studies in which catecholaminergic systems are activated or inhibited. Taken together they show that disturbances in the dynamic balance between neurochemical systems may alter the conditions for wake-triggering mechanisms to express at optimal levels. Large electrolytic or neurotoxic lesions which affect noradrenergic and dopaminergic structures are associated with marked and prolonged EEG changes and decreased behavioral arousal, respectively. In contrast, specific and circumscribed damage restricted to these systems is followed by a transient decrease in waking activity. Thus, results observed after large central lesions are most probably related to destruction of non-catecholaminergic neurons. Inhibition of brain CA synthesis causes behavioral sedation and a decrease in waking activity. Selective pharmacological stimulation of presynaptic alpha-adrenergic (alpha 2) receptors tends to decrease waking, while opposite effects result from alpha 2-receptor blockade. Drugs with agonistic activity at postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic (alpha 1) sites increase EEG desynchronization, but specific blockade of alpha 1-receptor does not result in marked decreases of waking EEG. In contrast, treatments which simultaneously block NE and DA receptors significantly affect waking. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers show no conclusive effects on waking or sleep. Selective DA-receptor agonists induce biphasic effects, with low doses decreasing and large doses increasing cortical desynchronization and motility. Opposite effects are observed in laboratory animals after injection of specific DA-receptor blockers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7045557/

Continuous electroencephalography and phot pulses from the cutaneous territories of the internal and the external carotid arteries were used to monitor 250 carotid operations. An intraoperative test, clamping of the common carotid artery and its two branches for 3 min, was performed on each patient. An internal shunt was routinely used in 18 patients. In the remaining 232 operations, an internal shunt was selectively used in only 13 of the 15 patients in whom there was focal showing on the EEG and/or a reduction in the amplitude of the ipsilateral supraorbital pulses to less than 25% of their preclamping values. In the group in which no shunt was used, the duration of the carotid clamping varied from 6 to 59 min, with a mean of 26 min. Seven patients died, but death was related to brain ischemia during surgery in only two. There were no ischemic neurological complications, except in the patients who died.

Differential effects might have been detected in other studies had individual subject data been adequately analyzed. In research with nonhuman subjects, nicotine and tobacco smoke produced cortical arousal and sometimes a biphasic effect of arousal followed by apparent sedation. Behavioral effects accompanied the cortical arousal, including eyelid opening, head movements, and eye movements. During the synchronization phase, crouching, low mobility, and closed eyes occurred.

During enflurane anesthesia IOP decreased from control values of 19.00 +/- 1.44 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 14.50 +/- 1.60 mm Hg during level, I, 14.10 +/- 1.04 mm Hg during level II, and 11.60 +/- 1.46 mm Hg during level III anesthesia. The increase in IOP during neurolept level I anesthesia was not statistically significant but the decreases in IOP from control values during levels II and III anesthesia were statistically significant. Decreases in IOP from control values were statistically significant at all levels of enflurance anesthesia. There was, however, no statistical significance between the differences in IOP values during levels II and III neurolept anesthesia, nor between levels I, II, and III enflurane anesthesia. The differences in the mean IOP values between neurolept and enflurane anesthesia were statistically significant only during EEG level I anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6101299/

All subjects were women between 21 and 45 years of age. Earlier published reports had suggested that toe temperature elevation was the result of lowered sympathetic tone and marked a ""vegetative preparedness for sleep."" More recently, elevation of the toe temperature has been used to denote a level of chemical anesthesia sufficient for major surgery. In this study, however, the mean latency of the time course of the temperature elevation of the toe was uncorrelated with sleep onset determined by EEG criteria. Temperature elevations were frequently of large magnitude but were not uniformly observed across all subjects and all nights. It is suggested that the toe temperature elevation is reflective of metabolic adjustments which coincide with the onset of the night's first period of slow wave sleep.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/547488/

The chemical structure of befuraline is clearly different from that of the tricyclic antidepressant drugs. While the gross behavior in animals remains unaffected, the central nervous system depressed by reserpine, tetrabenazine or perphenazine is activated by even small doses of this novel compound. Exploratory activity is prolonged, and performance in operant behavior tests and in the conditioned avoidance response is improved by befuraline, indicating increased alertness, attentiveness and the capacity to react to environmental stimuli. High doses stimulate the CNS, causing EEG desynchronization. Befuraline displays an aggression-inhibiting activity; without having a sedative effect on the animals' normal behavior, it inhibits fighting behavior. The central anticholinergic effect of befuraline is negligible. No apomorphine or tryptamine potentiation is observed and hexobarbital anesthesia is not influenced. The peripheral autonomic nervous system, with the exception of the nictitating membrane in cats, is not affected by befuraline. It has a biphasic effect on the norepinephrine induced contraction of isolated guinea pig seminal vesicle and of isolated cat spleen slices. Although the mechanism of action is as yet not clear, it is assumed that, in addition to a direct influence on the central adrenergic structures, the inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin uptake and the inhibition of phosphodiesterase are responsible for the drug's effect. Befuraline has no undesirable effects on either the peripheral autonomic nervous system or the cardiovascular system, and it does not affect the normal gross behavior of animals. Because these favorable therapeutic aspects are coupled with low toxicity, befuraline may provide a new alternative in the treatment of depression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/582130/

Nonspecific postanesthetic slowing of the EEG was found, qualitatively similar to but more marked than that following exposure to enflurane. Generalized EEG slowing, with a tendency toward posterior delta activity and significant reduction of frequency and amplitude of the alpha rhythm, persisted for 6 to 8 days following anesthesia.

A potentially psychoactive postanesthetic serum bromide level of 2.97 +/- 0.17 mEq/L (SEM) was found 5 days following anesthesia.

Of the 250 with natural-sleep recordings, 110 children had normal records both awake and asleep. In 73 cases the awake record was normal but the asleep record showed abnormalities, the most common being spike discharges (60 children). Of these 60 children, 52 had a history suggestive of epilepsy or of febrile convulsions. A further 27 children had recordings which were equally abnormal awake and asleep, and 37 showed abnormalities while awake but greater abnormalities while asleep.

This method of data analysis graphically accentuates the electroencephalographic correlates of ischemia-induced cerebral dysfunction and other cerebral oxygen consumption abnormalities. The ability to accentuate trends in frequency and power is derived from sequential plotting of spectra to produce a graph with three dimensional axes of frequency, time, and power. In carotid endarterectomies the system has proven more useful than the conventional EEG in assessing the need for a vascular shunt to maintain internal carotid flow during endarterectomy. In open-heart surgery time-compressed EEG spectral analysis has allowed early recognition of cerebral ischemia resulting from arterial hypotension and venous hypertension.

Failure of endarterectomy is usually due to incomplete removal of the lesion or to thrombosis upon the frayed intima. Such lesions require excellent visualization and meticulous surgical technique -- not always possible with a shunt. Among 130 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed under general anesthesia, EEG changes consistent with cerebral ischemia appeared in only nine (7%). These patients required a shunt. In 11 patients normal EEG tracings were obtained during endarterectomy despite contralateral carotid occlusion. None of these patients had a neurological deficit. Continuous EEG monitoring is a reliable method of detecting changes in cerebral perfusion, permits a more meticulous endarterectomy in high-lying lesions without a shunt, and extends operability in high risk patients.

During occlusion, the minimally acceptable (critical) internal carotid artery stump pressure is reported to be 50 torr, whereas for regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a critical range is reported to be 18-24 ml/100 g/min. During 90 carotid endarterectomies, rCBF and stump pressure were measured and the EEG continuously monitored. A positive correlation between rCBF and stump pressure (i.e., when both were either above or below their respective critical values) was observed in only 58 per cent of the cases. In 28 per cent stump pressures of less than 50 torr were observed despite rCBF's above 24 ml/100 g/min and normal EEG's. In 8 per cent stump pressures were more than 50 torr but rCBF's were less than 18 ml/100 g/min and EEG changes of ischemia were commonly observed. In the remaining 6 per cent rCBF's were marginal (18-24 ml/100 g/min) while stump pressures were more than 50 torr and EEG changes were not observed. The relationship between stump pressure and rCBF was influenced by the anesthetic. In the absence of transient ischemia during occlusion (that is, rCBF greater than 18 ml/100 g/min), halothane and enflurane anesthesia were associated with significantly higher rCBF's and lower stump pressures than was neuroleptanesthesia. Pre-occlusion and post-occlusion rCBF measurements also demonstrated cerebral vasodilation by halothane and enflurane (halothane greater than enflurane) and vasoconstriction by neuroleptanesthesia. It is concluded that stump pressure is an unreliable index of CBF during carotid occlusion and that its relationship to CBF is considerably influenced by the anesthetic.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/973690/

Prostaglandins of the E series tend to cause sedation, whereas this action is much less obvious with F prostaglandins. Prostaglandin therapy for termination of pregnancy is usually administered by the intrauterine route, which means that only very low concentrations of prostaglandin E2 or prostaglandin F2alpha reach the cerebral circulation after passage through the highly effecient metabolizing system in the lungs. The blood-brain barrier may also reduce the amount of prostaglandin reaching the nerve cells.However, prostaglandin F2alpha appears to have been responsible for major convulsions in a small proportion of patients, and the appearance of epileptiform spike activity has been clearly demonstrated in some patients with normal pretreatment EEGs. Prostaglandin E2 has not been reported to cause convulsions or epileptiform spike activity in normal women, although deterioration of an already abnormal EEG has been seen in one patient. Although the risk of convulsions with prostaglandin F2alpha is low, it seems preferable to use prostalgandins E2 where possible, particularly on patients with a history of epilepsy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/963968/

There are several possible clinical applications of such a monitoring system during anaesthesia. It provides a continuous estimation of the depth of anaesthesia, without requiring any special EEG training on the part of the anaesthetist. This system can also be of particular benefit during anaesthesia for critically ill patients, or in specific cases, as in neurosurgery and caesarian section when there may be periods of time when the gross clinical evaluation of depth of anaesthesia may not be precise or reliable and yet it is imperative not to deepen the anaesthesia unnecessarily. In such instances it appears that a monitoring system such as we have developed could provide valuable indication of the depth of anaesthesia.

The control phase consisted of 5 consecutive nights before morphine administration.

The stable dose phase consisted of 5 consecutive nights after the subjects had received 240 mg of morphine daily for 8-19 weeks. No sleep could be studied during the withdrawal phase. Sleep was continuously monitored with EEG, EMG and EOG. Chronic morphine produces signs of a small but persistent sleep disturbance: delta sleep (early night) becomes less stable and shifts toward later in the night, waking state increases during the middle of the night, RME sleep (expecially its activated EEG without eye movements) decreases, the RMES cycle increases, and burst of delta activity (with mean duration of 5-6 sec) increase. Although this disturbance persists throughout the night, it is much less than that seen after single doses of morphine in a previous study. With chronic morphine, therefore, partial tolerance develops to the sleep disturbance produced by morphine. The small but persistent nocturnal arousal during chronic morphine contrasts with the sedation seen during chronic methadone. Both opioids produce an increase in delta bursts during chronic administration, which might be an EEG phenomenon specific to chronic opioid intake.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/172930/

1211074,A clinical trial of enflurane in children.,Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,1975,"Söderberg M, Grattidge P","Enflurane was administered as the primary anaesthetic agent to 200 children between the ages of 7 months and 14 years who were undergoing elective surgery. Induction and recovery were rapid and generally uneventful. Changes observed in the cardiovascular system included an initial fall in blood pressure, which tended subsequently to correct itself, and supraventricular arrhythmias mainly of nodal rhythm type. End expiratory CO2-concentration as measured by a capnograph tended to be elevated during spontaneous ventilation . Changes in liver function as measured by enzymatic activity were seen in some cases but were without statistical significance. Satisfactory muscle relaxation was generally obtained without the use of muscle relaxants. However, in two cases, poor relaxation occurred even at a concentration of 4.5% enflurane, and in these cases, EEG changes of polyspike suppression type were observed. This phenomenon is discussed in a subsequent article. As a result of their findings, the authors conclude that in paediatric anaesthesia enflurane is best suited for use in anaesthetics of relatively short duration with spontaneous respiration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1211074/
4850939,"Cerebral blood flow, internal carotid artery pressure, and the EEG as a guide to the safety of carotid ligation.","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",1974,"Leech PJ, Miller JD, Fitch W, Barker J","Twenty patients with aneurysms of the internal carotid artery underwent temporary clamping, in turn, of the internal and then the common carotid artery. Cerebral blood flow, internal carotid artery pressure, and the EEG were recorded to assess the probability of cerebral ischaemia after permanent ligation. With this method of monitoring the cerebral circulation, 17 of the 20 patients had a permanent carotid ligation without neurological deficit; in the other three ligation was contraindicated. Although a correlation was observed between the reduction of cerebral blood flow and the fall in internal carotid artery pressure caused by temporary clamping (P<0·01), the scatter of data was too wide to predict cerebral blood flow from the change in carotid artery pressure. Similarly, EEG slowing was usually associated with low cerebral blood flow but exceptions occurred. Ligation was safe when, during temporary clamping, cerebral blood flow exceeded 40 ml/100 g/min, but was deemed unsafe when flow was less than 20 ml/100 g/min. In the range 20-40 ml/100 g/min, consideration of the internal carotid artery pressure permitted more patients to be safely ligated than if the decision had rested on changes in cerebral blood flow alone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4850939/

Elimination of the bulbar segment was without marked effect. Some synchronization followed elimination of the pons, but the most pronounced and prolonged changes occurred as a result of mesencephalic transection, or of discrete injury to the midbrain tegmentum or basal diencephalon, following which the EEG activation pattern of low voltage fast activity was reduced or abolished and the cortical record became dominated by recurring bursts or spindles of high voltage slow waves like those of normal sleep or barbiturate anesthesia. Bursts could be recorded from the intralaminar and other nuclei of the thalamus and these thalamic bursts were abolished by acute decortication. Conversely, cortical bursts were abolished by acute thalamic lesions. Possible interrelations of these regions in this activity is discussed. These results offer an explanation for the clinical observation of somnolence following basal injury to the brain, and suggest that a maintained influence of the ascending brain stem activating system underlies wakefulness, while absence of this influence precipitates sleep.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18421836/
