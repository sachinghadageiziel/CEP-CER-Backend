40829686,Advanced neuromonitoring techniques for medical and neurological ICU patients.,Brain research bulletin,2025,"Eshraghi R, Yazdani MS, Bahrami A, Amani-Beni R, Darouei B, Mokhtari M, Hashemian SM","Newly developed neurological complications are not confined to patients admitted to the neurology ICU but also occur in the medical ICU. In addition to patients with traumatic brain injuries, critically ill patients with sepsis, encephalopathy, and post-cardiopulmonary resuscitation are at risk of developing neurological complications. The situation can worsen when patients are sedated and intubated, which prevents the clinical manifestations to be presented. In this regard, non-convulsive seizures and status epilepticus, new onset strokes, and neuromuscular weakness syndromes could be missed which escalates the prognosis. The advancement of neuromonitoring technology enables real-time, multimodal assessments of brain functions, improving the ability of clinicians to detect and preemptively address potential neurological complications. In this study, we reviewed which certain neurological and medical conditions pose a high risk for developing secondary or new-onset neurological complications. Additionally, we reviewed various approaches that can assist in detecting these complications, including automated pupillometry, Bispectral Index monitoring, electroencephalogram, somatosensory evoked potentials monitoring, jugular venous oxygen saturation monitoring, PbO2 monitoring, near-infrared spectroscopy, transcranial Doppler sonography, thermal diffusion flowmetry, cerebral perfusion pressure monitoring, and biomarkers associated with neuronal damage. Last but not least, we reviewed the potential of integrating artificial intelligence in the ICU.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40829686/
40769410,EEG theta and alpha biomarkers during an avoid-avoid conflict task: Links to anxiety.,International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology,2025,"Stocker B, Moore R, Lockhart T","Goal conflict is central to anxiety processing, but certain forms of goal conflict, such as avoid-avoid, remain under-investigated in EEG research. This study adapted the Joystick Operated Runway Task (JORT) for use with EEG to explore neural biomarkers of goal conflict related to the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS), a key component of Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST). A novel Trial Calibration System (TCS) was implemented to control motor activity and equate task difficulty across participants during high and low conflict conditions. Forty right-handed participants (aged 18-24) completed the EEG-adapted JORT, where conflict was manipulated by varying the speed of aversive stimuli. Behavioural data confirmed effective goal conflict induction: high conflict trials produced slower reaction times, more joystick movements, and a performance accuracy near 52 %, indicating a balanced conflict. EEG analyses using Current Source Density (CSD) transformations revealed increased right-frontal theta power and coherence during high conflict trials, consistent with BIS engagement. Left-frontal alpha power and coherence were more prominent during low conflict, while high conflict also produced elevated alpha power in parieto-occipital regions, suggesting roles in early threat detection and sensory integration. These results suggest that avoid-avoid goal conflict reliably activates BIS-related neural systems and that the updated JORT provides a valid method for studying anxiety-related biomarkers. Using a motor-calibrated framework, this is the first study to integrate EEG with an avoid-avoid conflict paradigm. Future work should examine pharmacological modulation and include clinical samples to further validate the specificity of the observed neural patterns for anxiety-related conflict processing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40769410/

Eight RCTs with 2,666 patients: 1,304 received EEG-guided anesthesia and 1,362 received usual care.
Anesthesia guided by EEG in cardiothoracic surgery.
Mean differences (MDs) were used to pool continuous outcomes while risk ratios (RRs) were used for binary outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A random-effects model was used to examine the treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using R Studio. EEG-guided anesthesia was associated with a trend toward reduced ventilatory support duration (MD: -25.08, 95% CI: -50.12 to -0.04, p = 0.05, I² = 0%). No significant differences were found in postoperative delirium (RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.79-1.09, p = 0.35, I² = 42.6%), hospital length of stay (MD: -0.22, 95% CI: -0.53 to 0.09, p = 0.17, I² = 4.7%), intensive care unit length of stay (MD: -0.24, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.12, p = 0.19, I² = 71.7%), mortality (RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.54-1.25, p = 0.36, I² = 42%), or intraoperative blood transfusion (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.74-1.25, p = 0.79, I² = 0%).

40683805,Response of the Conox quantitative electroencephalographic monitor to neuromuscular block in awake volunteers.,British journal of anaesthesia,2025,"Schuller PJ, Pretorius JPG, Newbery KB","The Conox monitor analyses the frontal EEG to generate two indices of anaesthetic effects: qCON, intended to indicate the level of consciousness, and qNOX, designed to reflect responsiveness to noxious stimuli. Two similar quantitative EEG devices, BIS and Entropy, have been shown to require muscle activity (EMG) to generate accurate index values in awake individuals. Without EMG, these devices produce misleadingly low values and incorrectly suggest sedation or anaesthesia despite the cortical EEG showing the subjects are awake. As EMG affects frequency bands used by Conox, it too could be incorporating muscle activity to generate high values in awake individuals.
We replayed EEGs recorded during awake paralysis to the Conox monitor via an electronic playback system to test whether it requires EMG to generate accurate values in awake subjects.
Both qCON and qNOX decreased after neuromuscular block to values consistent with sedation or anaesthesia, despite subjects being fully awake. qCON decreased below 60 in 15 of 19 trials, and qNOX decreased below 60 in 11 of 19 trials. Overall, 42% of qCON values during paralysis were <60, the level supposedly indicating anaesthesia.
Conox requires muscle activity to generate accurate values in awake individuals. Consequently, it might be an unreliable indicator of awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking drugs. Studies conducted without neuromuscular block can provide misleading guidance when applied to Conox use in paralysed patients. Clinicians should approach manufacturer guidelines with caution and not rely solely on index values to guide dosing of anaesthetic drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40683805/
40675419,The neurocognitive basis of deception: Individual differences of N2-related conflict monitoring in a social deception task.,Behavioural brain research,2025,"Bertram FE, Leue A","Conflict monitoring was investigated as a neuro-cognitive process of deception. To investigate individual differences of conflict monitoring during a social deception task, we employed the fronto-central N2 component of the electroencephalogram. N = 96 participants (male = 48) reported the trustworthiness or untrustworthiness of previously learned faces in two experimental conditions (affective vs. neutral) either truthfully or deceptively and completed the German BIS/BAS scales and the Conflict Monitoring Questionnaire-44. For an assessment of the robustness of the results, the N2 was quantified using three different quantification methods. Peak-to-peak N2 amplitudes were more negative following untrustworthy vs. trustworthy stimuli regardless of the truthfulness, indicating their sensitivity to negative affect. None of the investigated traits had a significant effect on the individual extent of conflict monitoring. The peak-to-peak amplitude appeared to be most suitable for quantifying the N2 in the examination of conflict monitoring during deception. Results indicated shorter response times and higher correct rates for truthful responses. Since the significance of the Picture type main effect varies with the N2 quantification method, assessing reliability data and examining paradigm parameters could clarify the impact of different N2 quantification approaches on achieving excellent reliability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40675419/
40449739,Linking motor impulsivity to cue-induced craving and central beta oscillations in individuals with methamphetamine use disorder.,Behavioural brain research,2025,"Yang X, Zhao Y, Li J, Wang Y","This study investigated neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between impulsivity and cue-induced craving in methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). EEG recordings from 42 males with MUD and 46 healthy controls during rest and virtual reality cue exposure revealed three key findings: First, central-parietal beta power (Cz/Cp1) significantly increased during cue exposure in MUD patients (p < 0.001). Second, mediation analysis demonstrated a dual pathway where motor impulsivity (BIS-11) both directly exacerbated craving (β = 0.326, p = 0.001) and indirectly attenuated it through enhanced beta oscillations (indirect effect: β = -0.081, 95 % CI [-0.189, -0.001]). Third, the net effect remained positive (total effect = 0.244), suggesting incomplete compensation. These findings highlight central beta oscillations as a potential biomarker for craving regulation in high-impulsivity individuals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40449739/

40279280,The Effect of Electroencephalographic Trajectory During Anesthesia Emergence on the Indices Monitoring the Hypnotic Component.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2026,"Obert DP, Taetow R, Kratzer S, von Dincklage F, García PS, Schneider G, Kreuzer M","Postoperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) are frequent and serious complications that cause an enormous social and economic burden. A previous study demonstrated that certain electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns during emergence from general anesthesia are associated with a higher risk for PND. Compared to patients demonstrating the most favorable trajectory ( Traj Ref : delta-dominant slow-wave anesthesia (ddSWA)→spindle-dominant SWA (sdSWA)→non-SWA (nSWA)→wake), patients presenting Traj Abrupt (ddSWA→wake) had 4-fold increased odds to develop PND and patients with Traj High (nSWA→wake) had 8-fold increased odds of developing PND. We hypothesized that commonly used neuromonitoring devices (state entropy [SE], quantium consciousness index [qCON], bispectral index [BIS], and Patient State Index [PSI]) can differentiate between the various trajectories.
From the original database of the study by Hesse et al, we analyzed 59 EEGs from patients emerging from general anesthesia. They were selected according to their trajectory. We included 19 patients who had shown the most favorable trajectory ( Traj Ref ), 20 who had demonstrated Traj Abrupt , and 20 who had followed Traj High . To evaluate the performance of the neuromonitoring devices, we replayed the patients' EEGs to the monitors using an EEG player. We compared the index values for the 3 different trajectories ( TrajRef , TrajAbrupt , and Traj High ) generated by the different monitoring devices, respectively. Additionally, we evaluated the correlation between the monitoring devices.
SE and PSI were able to resolve significant differences between Traj Ref and Traj Abrupt during a major part of emergence. Traj Ref showed an almost linear increase of index values, whereas Traj Abrupt led to an episode of low index values followed by a sudden increase. However, when comparing Traj Ref vs Traj High , qCON, PSI, and BIS were the indices showing significant differences, especially at the beginning of emergence. Patients representing Traj Ref patterns had significantly lower index values than those depicting TrajHigh . Due to the TrajHigh cases starting in nSWA, their indices were already high at the start of emergence.
Our analysis revealed that the course of the different indices reflects spectral EEG patterns during the emergence from general anesthesia. Considering certain emergence trajectories associated with a higher risk of developing PND, our approach might enable the anesthetist to identify patients particularly susceptible to PND by observing the course of index values before admission to the postanesthesia care unit.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40279280/

Yet, associations between intraoperative anaesthetic-dose-adjusted alpha power and delirium or delirium risk factors have yet to be quantified.
We examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related biomarkers, cognitive scores, EEG recordings, and delirium data from 82 noncardiac, non-neurologic surgical patients ≥60 yr in age. Based on prior work, each participant's intraoperative frontoparietal EEG alpha power was anaesthetic dose-adjusted by dividing it by (2.5 minus the age-adjusted end-tidal minimum alveolar concentration), and then analysed for its association with POD and delirium risk factors, preoperative CSF AD-related biomarkers, and preoperative cognition.
Lower anaesthetic-dose-adjusted frontoparietal alpha power was associated with increased odds of POD (odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.44 [1.09, 1.89], P=0.009) and moderate-to-severe delirium (odds ratio [95% CI]: 1.44 [1.04, 2.00], P=0.030). Anaesthetic-dose-adjusted frontoparietal alpha power was not associated with pathologic concentrations of CSF pTau-181, Aβ1-42, or pTau-181/Aβ1-42 (P>0.05). In multivariable cognitive models, anaesthetic-dose-adjusted frontoparietal alpha power was associated with preoperative timed processing speed/executive function performance (β [95% CI]: 0.27 [0.06, 0.49], P=0.014), but not with untimed attention/memory performance (β [95% CI]: 0.12 [-0.13, 0.37], P=0.349).
Lower intraoperative anaesthetic-dose-adjusted frontoparietal alpha power was associated with delirium and delirium-predisposing factors (impaired preoperative processing speed/executive function in timed attention tasks).

To optimize intraoperative analgesic titration, several monitoring devices have been developed, each targeting specific physiologic variables. However, existing devices primarily focus on isolated components of the nociceptive response, such as autonomic or cortical activity, without integrating these perspectives comprehensively. Our aim was to compare the performance of different nociception monitors in response to standardized tetanic stimulation and to investigate the correlation between these monitors' responses and varying concentrations of remifentanil.
In this study, we evaluated and compared the responses of the Nociception Level index (NOL), Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI), Pupillary Reflex Dilation (PRD) and both raw and processed electroencephalogram (EEG) under varying concentrations of propofol and remifentanil. Standardized tetanic stimuli were administered to patients under general anesthesia with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. EEG, PRD, NOL, ANI, heart rate (HR), Bispectral index (BIS), and CONOX monitor indices (qCON and qNOX) were concomitantly recorded.
ANI, BIS, HR, NOL, PRD, and qNOX significantly changed after noxious stimulation. In our dataset, PRD had the strongest correlation with varying remifentanil concentrations, while ANI, NOL, and qNOX did not show significant correlations with remifentanil concentrations. Following a noxious stimulus, the raw EEG in patients with low PRD exhibited a significant increase in power in the high EEG frequencies around 25 Hz and decreased power in frequencies corresponding to the alpha range (8-12 Hz) in the power spectral density.
PRD, HR, and BIS correlated with varying levels of remifentanil, with PRD exhibiting the strongest correlation. When CE remifentanil are low, noxious stimuli are more likely to dilate the pupil and be detected in the EEG. Considering the complexity of the nociceptive response, integrating multimodal neurophysiologic monitoring with pharmacological data may improve the anesthesiologist's ability to assess on the nociception-antinociception balance. However, further studies are needed to validate these findings and address the study's limitations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40220354/

HeartMate 3™ operates at frequency bands that overlap with those used for calculating the electromyographic index (EMG) and bispectral index (BIS) on the Bispectral Index™ monitor. This study investigated whether HeartMate 3 elevates these values, a change not predicted with HeartMate II™. This retrospective observational study included data from patients who underwent HeartMate 3 or II implantation between April 2008 and December 2023 as extracted from our institutional database. Patient-wise median EMG and BIS were compared between the pre-LVAD period (from the start of surgery to initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass) and the post-LVAD period (from the end of cardiopulmonary bypass to end of surgery). Data were obtained from 33 and 43 patients who underwent HeartMate 3 and HeartMate II implantation, respectively. Patients with HeartMate 3 implantation showed significant elevation in the EMG (pre-LVAD, mean ± standard deviation, 26.1 ± 1.0 dB; post-LVAD, 39.5 ± 2.8 dB; P < 0.001) without a significant change in the BIS (pre-LVAD, 44.5 ± 8.1; post-LVAD, 45.5 ± 7.1; P = 0.35). In contrast, patients with HeartMate II implantation did not show significant changes in either the EMG (pre-LVAD, 26.1 ± 1.2 dB; post-LVAD, 27.1 ± 4.1 dB; P = 0.16) or BIS (pre-LVAD, 45.1 ± 9.2; post-LVAD, 43.0 ± 8.1; P = 0.071).

39786948,Developing an Electroencephalogram-based Model to Predict Awakening after Cardiac Arrest Using Partial Processing with the BIS Engine.,Anesthesiology,2025,"Snider SB, Molyneaux BJ, Murthy A, Rademaker Q, Rajwani H, Scirica BM, Lee JW, Connor CW","Accurate prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest is a challenging and high-stakes endeavor. The authors sought to determine whether internal electroencephalogram (EEG) subparameters extracted by the BIS monitor (Medtronic, USA), a device commonly used to estimate depth of anesthesia intraoperatively, could be repurposed to predict recovery of consciousness after cardiac arrest.
In this retrospective cohort study, a three-layer neural network was trained to predict recovery of consciousness to the point of command following versus not based on 48 h of continuous EEG recordings in 315 comatose patients admitted to a single U.S. academic medical center after cardiac arrest (derivation cohort, n = 181; validation cohort, n = 134). Continuous EEGs were partially processed into subparameters using virtualized emulation of the BIS Engine ( i.e. , the internal software of the BIS monitor) applied to signals from the frontotemporal leads of the standard 10-20 EEG montage. The model was trained on hourly averaged measurements of these internal subparameters. This model's performance was compared to the modified Westhall qualitative EEG scoring framework.
Maximum prognostic accuracy in the derivation cohort was achieved using a network trained on only four BIS subparameters (inverse burst suppression ratio, mean spectral power density, gamma power, and theta/delta power). In a held-out sample of 134 patients, the model outperformed current state-of-the-art qualitative EEG assessment techniques at predicting recovery of consciousness (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.86; accuracy, 0.87; sensitivity, 0.83; specificity, 0.88; positive predictive value, 0.71; negative predictive value, 0.94). Gamma band power has not been previously reported as a correlate of recovery potential after cardiac arrest.
In patients comatose after cardiac arrest, four EEG features calculated internally by the BIS Engine were repurposed by a compact neural network to achieve a prognostic accuracy superior to the current clinical qualitative accepted standard, with high sensitivity for recovery. These features hold promise for assessing patients after cardiac arrest.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786948/

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether use of a BIS monitor to guide sevoflurane administration might reduce the average end tidal sevoflurane concentration used in children 4-18 years of age.
Participants in three age groups (4-8, 9-12, and 13-18 years) were randomized to either the BIS guided group or the control group. Use of sevoflurane as the primary maintenance anesthetic was the only requirement in both arms. In the BIS guided group, sevoflurane was titrated to achieve a target BIS value of 45-60 during the maintenance period. In the control arm, clinicians were blinded to the BIS value. Primary outcome was mean end-tidal sevoflurane concentration during maintenance phase of anesthesia. Secondary assessments included time to discharge and the readiness and quality of recovery as assessed by the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale, the modified Aldrete Score, and the Wong-Baker FACES scale. An intention-to-treat analysis was used to analyze and compare groups.
A total of 180 participants were randomized. Following randomization, 10 participants did not undergo any study procedures, leaving 84 participants in the BIS guided group and 86 participants in the control group. Across all age groups, the average end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was less in the BIS guided group compared to control (4-8 years: 2.2% ± 0.3% vs. 2.4% ± 0.4%, -0.3% [-0.4%, -0.1%]; 9-12 years: 1.7% ± 0.5% vs. 2.1% ± 0.6%, -0.4% [-0.7%, -0.1%]; 13-18 years: 1.6% ± 0.4% vs. 1.9% ± 0.5%, -0.3% [-0.5%, -0.1%]). No differences in recovery outcomes between treatment groups were observed.
In pediatric participants, the BIS guided group reported a lower average end-tidal sevoflurane concentration compared to control, though no significant differences in recovery profile were noted.
The Bispectral Index (BIS) is a processed EEG tool that can be used to titrate general anesthesia to achieve desired anesthetic depth. Brain monitoring with BIS resulted in lower average end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations in children aged 4-18 years undergoing general anesthesia.

However, their reliability in children under 2 years of age remains questionable. During anesthesia maintenance in this age group, processed EEG indices frequently exhibit unexpectedly elevated values that exceed the intended target range.
This study aimed to identify EEG spectral parameters associated with false positive elevations in processed EEG indices and investigate their differences from true positive elevations during emergence.
This prospective observational study included 50 children aged 4-24 months undergoing general anesthesia. Bispectral index (BIS), patient state index (PSi), and raw EEG were continuously recorded throughout anesthesia. False positive was defined as elevated processed EEG indices when end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was maintained at 0.7-1.3 minimum alveolar concentration, with heart rate and mean blood pressure between 80% and 120% of baseline values. We analyzed EEG power spectra and band power values during periods of false positives and compared them with those of true positives during emergence. Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05 was considered significant.
False positives in processed EEG indices were observed in 35 (70%) of the children during anesthesia maintenance, occupying 28% of the maintenance phase. These false positives were associated with decreased power in delta (269-174 dB) and theta (115-97 dB) bands, but widespread increases in alpha and beta bands, resulting in elevated spectral edge frequency (19-22 Hz). Notably, EEG band power during false positives significantly differed from those observed during emergence (delta: 52 dB, theta: 38 dB) (all p < 0.001).
Processed EEG indices may exhibit unexpectedly elevated values during anesthesia maintenance in children under 2 years of age. Quantitative assessments derived from raw EEG data may improve the evaluation of anesthetic depth in this population.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39723638/

We examine the variability in bispectral index (BIS) scores associated with disconnected conscious and unconscious states as confirmed by a novel serial awakening paradigm.
Seventy adult participants, given propofol or dexmedetomidine, had a cumulative 1381 electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings across two centres. Participants were awakened periodically, and their recent conscious experience interrogated by structured questioning. BIS were reconstructed from EEG using openibis, and the distribution of BIS scores were compared using linear mixed effects modelling. The predictive capacity of BIS across states of consciousness was also examined.
Reconstructed BIS scores correlated significantly with blood concentrations of propofol and dexmedetomidine (all P<0.001). However, while the average BIS was different between baseline wakefulness (mean BIS=95.1 [standard deviation=3.5]); connected consciousness with drug present (84.0 [10.9]); disconnected consciousness (70.0 [16.9]); and unconsciousness (68.1 [16.1]), the interquartile range of these states (3.6, 15.1, 23.3 and 26.8, respectively) indicated high degrees of overlap and individual variability. Connected consciousness could be differentiated from either disconnected consciousness or unconsciousness with 86% accuracy (i.e. 14% error rate), and disconnected consciousness differentiated from unconsciousness with 74% accuracy.
These results agree with previous studies that BIS scores fail to reliably differentiate between states of consciousness, exacerbated by segregating connected, disconnected, and unconscious states. To develop a method that reliably identifies the conscious state of an individual (not an average), work is needed to establish the causal mechanisms of disconnection and unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39665912/

We analyzed an electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset for sevoflurane anesthesia using two wavelet transform-based mode decomposition methods, comprising the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and wavelet mode decomposition (WMD) methods, and compared the results with those from the previously reported variational mode decomposition (VMD) method.
To acquire the EEG data, we used the software application EEG Analyzer, which enabled the recording of raw EEG signals
When decomposed into six IMFs, the EWT enables narrow band separation of the low-frequency bands IMF-1 to IMF-3, in which all central frequencies are less than 10 Hz.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between the effect-site concentration of ketamine (CeK) and 2 electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived parameters, the BIS and spectral edge frequency (SEF 95 ), after the administration of a ketamine bolus. Secondary aims included investigating the BIS and SEF 95 variations with time and changes in the surgical pleth index (SPI).
We conducted an observational, prospective, single-center study analyzing intraoperative data from 14 adult female patients undergoing breast oncologic surgery. During stable propofol-remifentanil target-controlled infusion (TCI) anesthesia, a ketamine analgesic bolus was delivered with the target CeK set to 1 μg.mL -1 (Domino model) corresponding to a dose of 0.57 mg.kg -1 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.56-0.57 mg.kg -1 ). Once the CeK reached a value of 1 μg.mL -1 , the target CeK was set to 0 μg.mL -1 . We determined the median BIS, SEF 95 , and SPI trends with time and as a function of the modeled CeK.
BIS and SEF 95 showed no significant change from when ketamine was administered to when CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , but a significant increase was observed at lower CeKs. The maximum BIS was reached at 16.0 minutes [10.2-22.7 minutes] after CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , at CeK=0.22 μg.mL -1 [0.12-0.41 μg.mL -1 ]. The peak SEF 95 value was observed at 10.0 minutes [8.62-14.1 minutes] after CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , at CeK=0.43 μg.mL -1 [0.25-0.50 μg.mL -1 ]. No significant association was found between CeK and the registered SPI values.
Our results show that BIS and SEF 95 , but not SPI, follow a CeK-dependent trend after administering a ketamine bolus. Interestingly, their peak values were not reached at CeK=1 μg.mL -1 , but after several minutes after the drug infusion at CeKs in the 0.2 to 0.5 μg.mL -1 range. This may be explained by the specific pharmacodynamics of ketamine and its varying effects at different concentrations, as well as by the time delay associated with the calculation of the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39485729/

This study thus aimed to explore whether pre-anesthesia brain functional network metrics correlate with an individual's sensitivity to propofol.
A total of 54 subjects, including 30 patients and 24 healthy volunteers, were enrolled. Propofol was administered via a target-controlled infusion device, and anesthesia depth was monitored using a bispectral index monitor. Sensitivity to propofol was quantified using the induction time, measured from infusion onset to the bispectral index, which reached 60. Brain functional network metrics indicative of functional integration and segregation, centrality, and network resilience were computed from pre-anesthetic 60-channel EEG recordings. Linear regression analysis and machine learning predictive models were applied to evaluate the contribution of pre-anesthesia network metrics in predicting individual sensitivity to propofol.
Our analysis results revealed that subjects could be categorized into high- or low-sensitivity groups based on their induction time. Individuals with low sensitivity exhibited a greater network degree, clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and betweenness centrality, along with reduced modularity and assortativity coefficient in the alpha band. Furthermore, alpha band network metrics were significantly correlated with individual induction time. Leveraging these network metrics as features enabled the classification of individuals into high- or low-sensitivity groups with an accuracy of 94%.
Using a clinically relevant endpoint that signifies the level of anesthesia suitable for surgical procedures, this study underscored the robust correlation between pre-anesthesia alpha-band network metrics and individual sensitivity to propofol in a cohort that included both patients and healthy volunteers. Our findings offer preliminary insights into the potential utility of pre-anesthetic brain status assessment to predict propofol sensitivity on an individual basis, which may help to develop a more accurate personalized anesthesia plan.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39366070/

To confirm the improved safety achieved through EEG guidance for drug administration during procedural sedation.
Following the revision of the departmental protocol, 14 standards were set. Sedation data and outcomes in 150 consecutive patients undergoing fluoroscopic and combined endoscopic procedures were evaluated against these. Combination sedo-analgesia was titrated by the interventional radiology nurses guided by bispectral index sensor (BIS) measurements to achieve readings between 80 and 85. Doses were stratified by patient age and ASA status. Nasal oxygen was given and standard monitoring including pulse oximetry and capnography were used alongside to assess for complications, notably hypoxaemia of ≤ 94%.
85% were non-vascular procedures, the bulk made up of oesophageal stent insertion, gastrostomy, oesophageal dilatation of radiation strictures and biliary procedures. Mean procedure time was 32.9 minutes (10-170). Mean doses of midazolam and fentanyl were 3.99mg (±1.9) and 92.3μg (±35.4), respectively. 84% of patients were classified as having received light or moderate sedation (BIS 70-89). Three standards for patient sedation were missed, but no patient required sedation reversal or airway management, and none developed hypoxaemia.
BIS guidance of sedation administration allows real-time assessment of the patient's response to sedo-analgesia administered and allows prediction about the safety of further drug administration. It identifies patients waking up, allowing this to be anticipated and reduces interruptions of the procedure. It offers clear clinical advantages to interval assessment of patients' response to clinical stimuli and reduces under-as well as oversedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39317529/

However, the influence of patient positioning changes, particularly in gynecological surgeries where a head-down position is often required, on the accuracy of these monitoring indices remains unexplored.
The aim of the our study was to observe the impact of patient position changes on the monitoring value of entropy and BIS to identify a more sensitive method of anaesthesia depth monitoring for gynaecological surgery patients.
We conducted a study involving 40 women undergoing general anesthesia, during which routine monitoring of vital signs, including electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR), noninvasive arterial blood pressure (NIBP), oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), and end-expiratory carbon dioxide (PetCO2), was initiated. Entropy and BIS devices were affixed to the patients' foreheads after alcohol sterilization to record brain activity. Tracheal intubation was performed following anesthesia induction. Throughout anesthesia maintenance, the value of BIS and response entropy (RE) were monitored and maintained between 40 and 50 by adjusting the infusion rate of propofol and remifentanil with Target Controlled Infusion (TCI, Mintopharmacokinetics model). Dosing for infusion control utilized corrected weight (height-105). Data were recorded before and after position changes, including tilting the operating table to head-down positions of 15 and 25 degrees, returning to a supine position, and elevating the head to 15 and 25-degree angles. BIS and entropy values at different time points were compared between the groups.
Both BIS and entropy values increased from supine to head-down position and decreased from supine to head-up position, with entropy changes preceding those of BIS. Heart rate increased after head-up and decreased after head-down, while mean blood pressure (MBP) exhibited the opposite effect on heart rate. Significant correlations were found between heart rate and BIS (correlation coefficient: -0.43) and RE (correlation coefficient: -0.416), as well as between MBP and BIS (correlation coefficient: 0.346) and RE (correlation coefficient: 0.384).
Changes in patient position can significantly affect the value of RE and BIS, as changes in entropy occur earlier than changes in the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39302400/

We investigated whether pBICs are good indicators for adequacy of analgesia during surgery.
After local ethical committee approval, we enrolled 50 patients (27-65 years, ASA-PS I or II) who were scheduled elective surgery. Besides standard anesthesia monitors, to assess pBICs, we used a BIS monitor and freeware Bispectrum Analyzer for A2000. Fentanyl 5 µg/kg was completely administered before incision, and anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. After skin incision, when the peak of pBIC-high or pBIC-low decreased by 10% in absolute value (named LT10-high and LT10-low groups in order) or when either peak decreased to below 20% (BL20-high and BL20-low groups), an additional 1 g/kg of fentanyl was administered to examine its effect on the peak that showed a decrease.
The mean values and standard deviation for pBIC-high 5 min before fentanyl administration, at the time of fentanyl administration, and 5 min after fentanyl administration for LT10-high group were 39.8% (10.9%), 26.9% (10.5%), and 35.7% (12.5%). And those for pBIC-low for LT10-low group were 39.5% (6.0%), 26.8% (6.4%) and 35.0% (7.0%). Those for pBIC-high for BL20-high group were 26.3% (5.6%), 16.5% (2.6%), and 25.7% (7.0%).

We investigated agreement between measured and predicted BIS values during total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA).
Forty participants undergoing lower limb surgery received TIVA using remifentanil target-controlled infusions and propofol by manually controlled, target-guided infusions based upon the Eleveld model and directed by two pharmacokinetic computer simulation applications: PKPD Tools and StelSim. We evaluated the predictive performance of the Eleveld model by calculating median prediction errors (BIS units) and by Bland-Altman analyses. We also performed |Bland-Altman analysis of supplementary data provided by the authors of the Eleveld model.
Whereas median prediction errors were small (MDPE -1.9, MDAPE 10), the ranges were wide (-18.5 to 24.3 and 1.7 to 24.3). The proportion of MDAPE >10 BIS units was 47.8%. Bland-Altman analysis showed a small mean bias (-0.52 BIS units) with wide limits of agreement (-27.7 to 26.2). Each participant's limits of agreement did not meet the requirements for declaring interchangeability between the two measurements. The measurement differences depended on the BIS values, as indicated by the positive slopes of the differences vs BIS values. Bland-Altman analysis of the Eleveld model supplementary data revealed similar results.
BIS predictions by the Eleveld model should be interpreted with caution. In spite of the acceptable MDPE and MDAPE, there are unacceptable degrees of both within-subject and between-subject variation during propofol target-controlled infusions. This limits the use of adjusting targeted concentrations to achieve desired simulated BIS values with confidence.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39179443/

Processed EEG indices are available that reflect the level of anesthesia as a single number. Strong oscillatory EEG activity in the alpha-band may be associated with an adequate level of anesthesia and a lower incidence of cognitive sequelae. So far, we do not know how the processed indices would react to changes in the alpha-band activity. Hence, we modulated the alpha-oscillatory activity of intraoperative EEG to assess possible index changes.
We performed our analyses based on data from 2 studies. Intraoperative EEG was extracted, and we isolated the alpha-band activity by band-pass filtering (8-12 Hz). We added or subtracted this activity to the original EEG in different steps with different amplifications of the alpha signal. We then replayed these signals to the bispectral index (BIS), the Entropy Module (state entropy [SE]), the CONOX (qCON), and the SEDLine (patient state index [PSI]); and evaluated the alpha-band modulation's impact on the respective index.
The indices behaved differently to the modulation. In general, indices decreased with stronger alpha-band activity, but the rate of change was different with SE showing the strongest change (9% per step) and PSI and BIS ( < 5% per step) showing the weakest change. A simple regression analysis revealed a decrease of 0.02 to 0.09 index points with increasing alpha amplification.
While the alpha-band in the intraoperative EEG seems to carry information regarding the quality of anesthesia, changes in the alpha-band activity do neither strongly nor uniformly influence processed EEG indices. Hence, to assess alpha-oscillatory activity's strength, the user needs to focus on the raw EEG or its spectral representation also displayed on the monitoring systems.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39093724/

However, these analyses were potentially confounded by co-administered drugs, in particular opioids and benzodiazepines. Thus, the goal of this prospective study was to characterize the influence of age and weight on the onset of hypnotic effects from propofol, reflected by the time to peak of propofol effect-site concentration in the absence of additional drugs.
A total of 46 healthy children aged 2-12 years presenting for elective surgery were included in our observational cohort study. Solely propofol was administered via a target-controlled infusion pump programmed with the Paedfusor pharmacokinetic model. The BIS and infusion pump data were recorded. The effect of an induction ""bolus"" was recorded having stopped the pump once a propofol plasma target concentration of 7 μg.mL
Time to peak of propofol effect-site concentration had a difference (p-value <.01) for age and weight, that is 84 [74, 96] (median [IQR] secs for children aged 2-6 years vs. 99 [91, 113] secs for children aged 8-12 years and 82 [71, 95] secs for weight 11-25 kg vs. 99 [91, 114] secs for weight 30-63 kg). The plasma effect-site equilibration rate constant for propofol had a heterogeneous distribution with a median of 2.36 (IQR: 2.05-2.93; range: 0.83-7.31) per minute but showed a weight-dependent effect in patients with weight below 45 kg.
In children, the age and weight have an influence on time to peak effect of propofol. In the absence of opioids and benzodiazepines, time to peak effect was approximately 20% longer in children aged 8-12 years as compared to younger children.

Can BIS-guided deep sedation (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale [RASS] score, -4 or -5) reduce sedative dosage and increase delirium-free and coma-free (DFCF) days?
A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary mixed ICU, enrolling patients requiring deep sedation for > 8 h. Patients were assigned randomly to either the clinical assessment (CA) or BIS groups (BIS range, 40-60). Both groups used a BIS sensor, whereas the CA group's screen remained covered. After deep sedation, BIS sensors were removed, and delirium was assessed twice daily by researchers masked to the randomization. The primary outcome was the number of DFCF days within 14 days after deep sedation. Additionally, we compared doses of sedative drugs and BIS values during deep sedation.
Ninety-nine patients were included in the study. We found no significant difference in DFCF days (P = .1) between CA and BIS arms, but propofol doses were significantly lower in the BIS group (CA group, 1.77 mg/kg/h [95% CI, 1.60-1.93] vs BIS group, 1.44 mg/kg/h [95% CI, 1.04-1.83]; P = .03). During deep sedation, the CA group spent 46% of the total hours (95% CI, 35%-57%) with BIS values of < 40, whereas the BIS group spent 32% (95% CI, 25%-40%; P = .03).

Bivariate correlations and multiple regression analysis yielded results generally consistent with past literature for associations between psychopathy and the self-report BIS/BAS scales. There were some differences from self-report associations with neural measures of RST. With EEG measures, (1) no meaningful associations were observed between any psychopathy scales and the attraction system; (2) affective-interpersonal traits of psychopathy were negatively associated with goal conflict; (3) disinhibition-behavioural traits of psychopathy were negatively associated with goal conflict but, unexpectedly, positively associated with outcome conflict.

Embase, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science were searched considering articles between their inception up to September 2023. Inclusion criteria were human (paediatric and adult) and animal studies describing correlations between continuous EEG and cerebrovascular autoregulation assessments.
Ten studies describing 481 human subjects (67% adult, 59% critically ill) were identified. Seven studies assessed qualitative (e.g. seizures, epileptiform potentials) and five evaluated quantitative (e.g. bispectral index, alpha-delta ratio) EEG metrics.

Comparative assessments of these studies highlight their methodological approaches and performance, including clinical correlations with established indices like the Bispectral Index. The review identifies knowledge gaps, particularly the need for improved collaboration for data access, which is essential for developing superior machine learning models and real-time predictive algorithms for patient management. It also calls for refined model evaluation processes to ensure robustness across diverse patient demographics and anaesthetic agents. The review underscores the potential of technological advancements to enhance precision, safety, and patient outcomes in anaesthesia, paving the way for a new standard in anaesthetic care.

This cross-sectional survey on the use of DoA monitors in Norway used a web-based questionnaire distributed to anesthesia personnel in all hospitals in Norway. Participation was voluntary and anonymized, and the web form could not track IP sources or respondents' locations.
Three hundred and ninety-one nurse anesthetists (n = 324) and anesthesiologists (n = 67) responded. Among the EEG-based DoA monitoring tools, BIS was most often used to observe and assess patients' DoA (98%). Raw EEG waveform analysis (10%), EEG-spectrogram (9%), and suppression rate (10%) were seldom used. Twenty-seven percent of the anesthesia personnel were able to recognize a burst suppression pattern on EEG and its significance. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents considered clinical observations more reliable than BIS. Almost all respondents reported adjusting anesthetic dosage based on the BIS index values (80%). However, the anesthetic dose was more often increased (90%) because of high BIS index values than lowered (55%) because of low BIS index values.
Despite our respondents' extensive use of DoA monitoring, the anesthesia personnel in our survey did not use all the information and the potential to guide the titration of anesthetics the DoA monitors provide. Thus, anesthesia personnel could generally benefit from increased knowledge of how EEG-based DoA monitoring can be used to assess and determine individual patients' need for anesthetic medication.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38551019/

The differences in the electroencephalogram bispectral index (BIS) during general anesthesia between propofol and remimazolam deserve further exploration.
Single-center randomized crossover study. Patients who required multiple hysteroscopic surgery were randomly assigned to use remimazolam (0.27 mg/kg for induction and 1 mg/kg/h for maintenance) first and then propofol (2.0 mg/kg for induction and 6 mg/kg/h for maintenance) during hysteroscopic surgery again 3 months later, or in the opposite order. Both drugs were used at the latest ED
Seventeen patients completed the study. The lowest BIS value in the remimazolam regimen was significantly higher than that in the propofol regimen (p = 0.001). The MMRM analysis of the BIS values revealed significant differences between the regimens at each time point (p < 0.001). The intraoperative diastolic blood pressure and heart rate changes were smaller, the recovery was faster, and there were fewer adverse reactions and less injection pain, but a greater incidence of intraoperative body movement and hiccups, in the remimazolam regimen.
The trial indicated that remimazolam maintained a higher BIS level than propofol. The correlation between the BIS and the depth of anesthesia induced by remimazolam needs to be further studied.

Technological improvements have led to new monitoring strategies, aimed at translating a qualitative physiological state into quantitative metrics, but the optimal strategies for depth of anesthesia (DoA) and analgesia monitoring continue to stimulate debate. Historically, DoA monitoring used patient's movement as a surrogate of awareness. Pharmacokinetic models and metrics, including minimum alveolar concentration for inhaled anesthetics and target-controlled infusion models for intravenous anesthesia, provided further insights to clinicians, but electroencephalography and its derivatives (processed EEG; pEEG) offer the potential for personalization of anesthesia care. Current studies appear to affirm that pEEG monitoring decreases the quantity of anesthetics administered, diminishes postanesthesia care unit duration, and may reduce the occurrence of postoperative delirium (notwithstanding the difficulties of defining this condition). Major trials are underway to further elucidate the impact on postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In this manuscript, we discuss the Bispectral (BIS) index, Narcotrend monitor, Patient State Index, entropy-based monitoring, and Neurosense monitor, as well as middle latency evoked auditory potential, before exploring how these technologies could evolve in the upcoming years. In contrast to developments in pEEG monitors, nociception monitors remain by comparison underdeveloped and underutilized. Just as with anesthetic agents, excessive analgesia can lead to harmful side effects, whereas inadequate analgesia is associated with increased stress response, poorer hemodynamic conditions and coagulation, metabolic, and immune system dysregulation. Broadly, 3 distinct monitoring strategies have emerged: motor reflex, central nervous system, and autonomic nervous system monitoring. Generally, nociceptive monitors outperform basic clinical vital sign monitoring in reducing perioperative opioid use. This manuscript describes pupillometry, surgical pleth index, analgesia nociception index, and nociception level index, and suggest how future developments could impact their use. The final section of this review explores the profound implications of future monitoring technologies on anesthesiology practice and envisages 3 transformative scenarios: helping in creation of an optimal analgesic drug, the advent of bidirectional neuron-microelectronic interfaces, and the synergistic combination of hypnosis and virtual reality.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38215709/

This study aimed to assess the agreement of BIS values based on the positions of either post-auricular or frontal sensors in individual patients undergoing renal surgeries while lateral positions at various stages of anesthesia.
12 patients older than 18 years, ASA I-III patients scheduled for elective renal operations, two BIS were placed on each patient, one on each side of the post-auricular region and one across the forehead, and each sensor was connected to a different BIS monitor. We gathered three pieces of data at each of the six-time points: BIS score, signal quality index (SQI) score calculating the signal's strength and electromyography (EMG) score: before the onset of anesthesia (awake) when the eyelash reflex is lost (LOC), after intubation (intubation), following the initial surgical incision, each 30 min throughout the procedure (maintenance), and at the moment the patient's eyes open naturally after waking up from anesthesia (emergence).
The overall BIS value at the frontal position was significantly higher than the post-auricular position (52.5 ± 22.2 and 52.1 ± 22.1, respectively, P = 0.010). On the other hand, the BIS value was comparable between the frontal and post-auricular positions at LOC, intubation, 60, 120, and 80 min and at emergence. A strong link between the two sensor positions, as indicated by the correlation coefficient (r = 0.607, P < 0.001), and the Bland-Altman analysis revealed a small mean difference (-1.8) and a low (9.0/- 12.5) limit of agreement, with just 4.3% of the readings falling outside of it during the anesthetic maintenance period.
Acceptable variation in BIS data was observed when obtained from the two different sensor positions for clinical usage. The post-auricular BIS sensor system may be a suitable substitute for an impractical frontal setup.

Substance-specific emergence characteristics may additionally limit the reliability of commonly used processed EEG indices during emergence. This study aims to analyze the dynamics of different EEG indices during anesthesia emergence that was maintained with different anesthetic regimens. We used the EEG of 45 patients under general anesthesia from the emergence period. Fifteen patients per group received sevoflurane, isoflurane (+ sufentanil) or propofol (+ remifentanil) anesthesia. One channel EEG and the bispectral index (BIS A-1000) were recorded during the study. We replayed the EEG back to the Conox, Entropy Module, and the BIS Vista to evaluate and compare the index behavior. The volatile anesthetics induced significantly higher EEG frequencies, causing higher indices (AUC > 0.7) over most parts of emergence compared to propofol. The median duration of ""awake"" indices (i.e., > 80) before the return of responsiveness (RoR) was significantly longer for the volatile anesthetics (p < 0.001). The different indices correlated well under volatile anesthesia (rs > 0.6), with SE having the weakest correlation. For propofol, the correlation was lower (rs < 0.6). SE was significantly higher than BIS and, under propofol anesthesia, qCON. Systematic differences of EEG-based indices depend on the drugs and devices used. Thus, to avoid early awareness or anesthesia overdose using an EEG-based index during emergence, the anesthetic regimen, the monitor used, and the raw EEG trace should be considered for interpretation before making clinical decisions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38108943/

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,2023,"Zhao Y, Boley M, Pelentritou A, Woods W, Liley D, Kuhlmann L","This study characterizes the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying electromagnetic imaging signals using stability analysis. Researchers have proposed that transitions between conscious awake and anaesthetised states, and other brain states more generally, may result from system stability changes. The concept of stability in dynamical systems theory provides a mathematical framework to describe this possibility. In particular, the degree to which a system's trajectory in phase space is affected by small perturbations determines the stability. Previous studies using linear or oscillator-based whole-brain models cannot represent complex cerebrocortical dynamics, or model parameters were pre-assumed or inferred from data but did not change over time. This study proposes a nonlinear neurophysiologically plausible whole-cortex modeling framework to analyze the stability of brain dynamics for the emergence and disappearance of consciousness using time-varying parameters estimated from the data.Clinical relevance- Depth of anaesthesia is typically measured through changes in EEG statistics like the bispectral index and spectral entropy. However, these monitors have been found to fail in preventing awareness during surgery and postoperative recall. Our whole-cortex stability analysis may be useful in measuring anaesthesia levels in clinical settings, as it changes with the level of consciousness and is independent of individual differences and anaesthetic agents. The proposed method can also be used to, for example, identify critical brain regions for consciousness, locate the epileptogenic zone and investigate the dominance of extrinsic or intrinsic factors in brain functions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38082665/

We investigated the correlation of the electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters with the effect-site remimazolam concentration and the depth of sedation in patients receiving a target-controlled infusion of remimazolam.
This prospective observational study enrolled 35 patients (32 analyzed) who underwent lower extremity varicose vein surgery or lower extremity orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia. We administered remimazolam by target-controlled infusion using the pharmacokinetic model introduced by Schüttler et al. The EEG data were continuously recorded, including the bispectral index (BIS), patient state index (PSI), spectral edge frequency (SEF), and raw EEG signals. The relative beta ratio (RBR), defined as log (spectral power [30-47 Hz]/spectral power [11-20 Hz]), was obtained by analyzing raw EEG. The level of sedation corresponding to each effect-site remimazolam concentration was assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S). The prediction probability (Pk) and Spearman's correlation coefficients (R) were calculated between effect-site remimazolam concentration, MOAA/S, and EEG parameters.
BIS and PSI showed significantly higher Pk for effect-site remimazolam concentration (Pk = 0.76 [0.72-0.79], P < .001 for BIS; Pk = 0.76 [0.73-0.79], P < .001 for PSI) compared to RBR (Pk = 0.71 [0.68-0.74], P < .001) and SEF (Pk = 0.58 [0.53-0.63], P = .002). BIS, PSI, and RBR showed significantly higher correlation coefficients for effect-site remimazolam concentration (R = -0.70 [-0.78 to -0.63], P < .001 for BIS; R = -0.72 [-0.79 to -0.66], P < .001 for PSI; R = -0.61 [-0.69 to -0.54], P < .001 for RBR) compared to SEF (R = -0.22 [-0.36 to -0.08], P = .002).

BIS, PSI, and RBR showed an acceptable correlation with the effect-site remimazolam concentration and depth of sedation in this study, suggesting that these EEG-derived parameters are potentially reliable hypnotic indicators during remimazolam sedation.

However, some clinicians avoid using it because of sudden unwanted acting out or patient arousal. Previous studies suggested sugammadex-induced awakening, but frontal muscle contraction after sugammadex administration compromised reliability of results obtained from EEG-based anesthesia depth monitoring tools like bispectral index (BIS). We hypothesized that sugammadex would affect patients' arousal depending on their baseline levels of sedation. We evaluated arousal signs after sugammadex administration with BIS between 25 - 35 and 45 - 55 under steady-state propofol-remifentanil anesthesia at the end of a surgery (n = 33 in each group). After sugammadex administration, twelve patients with a BIS of 45 - 55 showed clinical signs of awakening but none with a BIS of 25 - 35 (36.4% vs. 0%, P = 0.001). The distribution of the modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale scores was also significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.001).

It is frequently used in the context of neuromuscular block. We have shown that a similar device, the Bispectral Index monitor (BIS), does not generate correct values in awake volunteers when neuromuscular blocking drugs are administered.
We replayed the EEGs recorded during awake paralysis from the original study to an Entropy monitor via a calibrated electronic playback system. Each EEG was replayed 30 times to evaluate the consistency of the Entropy output.
Both State Entropy and Response Entropy decreased during periods of neuromuscular block to values consistent with anaesthesia, despite there being no change in conscious state (State Entropy <60 in eight of nine rocuronium trials and nine of 10 suxamethonium trials). Entropy values did not return to pre-test levels until after the return of movement. Entropy did not generate exactly the same results when the same EEG was replayed multiple times, which is primarily because of a cyclical state within the Entropy system itself.
The GE Entropy™ monitor requires muscle activity to generate correct values in an awake subject. It could therefore be unreliable at detecting awareness in patients who have been given neuromuscular blocking drugs. In addition, Entropy does not generate the same result each time it is presented with the same EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37879777/

The influence of depth of sedation indices such as the bispectral index (BIS) generated by the processed electroencephalogram (pEEG) machine to guide the management of anesthetic depth of sedation on postoperative outcome remains controversial. This research was designed to decide whether an anesthetic agent exposure determined by raw electroencephalogram (rEEG) can influence anesthetic management and cause different EEG patterns and affect various patient outcomes.
A total of 141 participants aged ≥ 60 years undergoing abdominal major surgery were randomized to rEEG-guided anesthesia or routine care group. The rEEG-guided anesthesia group had propofol titrated to keep the rEEG waveform at the C-D sedation depth during surgery, while in the routine care group the anesthetist was masked to the patient's rEEG waveform and guided the anesthetic management only through clinical experience. The primary outcome was the presence of postoperative complications, the secondary outcomes included intraoperative anesthetic management and different EEG patterns.
There were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of postoperative respiratory, circulatory, neurological and gastrointestinal complications. Further EEG analysis revealed that lower frontal alpha power was significantly associated with a higher incidence of POD, and that rEEG-guidance not only reduced the duration of deeper anesthesia in patients with lower frontal alpha power, but also allowed patients with higher frontal alpha power to receive deeper and more appropriate depths of anesthesia than in the routine care group.
In elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, rEEG-guided anesthesia did not reduce the incidence of postoperative respiratory, circulatory, neurological and gastrointestinal complications. rEEG-guided anesthesia management reduced the duration of intraoperative BS in patients and the duration of over-deep sedation in patients with lower frontal alpha waves under anesthesia, and there was a strong association between lower frontal alpha power under anesthesia and the development of POD. rEEG-guided anesthesia may improve the prognosis of patients with vulnerable brains by improving the early identification of frail elderly patients and providing them with a more effective individualized anesthetic managements.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37803259/

In daily clinical practice, the EEG is recorded from the forehead and available neuromonitoring systems translate the EEG information into an index inversely correlating with the anesthetic level. Electrode placement on the forehead can lead to an influence of electromyographic (EMG) activity on the recorded signal in patients without neuromuscular blockade (NMB). A separation of EEG and EMG in the clinical setting is difficult because both signals share an overlapping frequency range. Previous research showed that indices decreased when EMG was absent in awake volunteers with NMB. Here, we investigated to what extent the indices changed, when EEG recorded during surgery with NMB agents was superimposed with EMG.
We recorded EMG from the flexor muscles of the forearm of 18 healthy volunteers with a CONOX monitor during different activity settings, that is, during contraction using a grip strengthener and during active diversion (relaxed arm). Both the forehead and forearm muscles are striated muscles. The recorded EMG was normalized by z -scoring and added to the EEG in different amplification steps. The EEG was recorded during anesthesia with NMB. We replayed these combined EEG and EMG signals to different neuromonitoring systems, that is, bispectral index (BIS), CONOX with qCON and qNOX, and entropy module with state entropy (SE) and response entropy (RE). We used the Friedman test and a Tukey-Kramer post hoc correction for statistical analysis.
The indices of all neuromonitoring systems significantly increased when the EEG was superimposed with the contraction EMG and with high EMG amplitudes, the monitors returned invalid values, representative of artifact contamination. When replaying the EEG being superimposed with ""relaxed"" EMG, the qCON and BIS showed significant increases, but not SE and RE. For SE and RE, we observed an increased number of invalid values.
With our approach, we could show that EMG activity during contraction and resting state can influence the neuromonitoring systems. This knowledge may help to improve EEG-based patient monitoring in the future and help the anesthesiologist to use the neuromonitoring systems with more knowledge regarding their function.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37756246/

Hypoxia is a particular risk during rebreather diving. Given its subtle symptom profile and its catastrophic consequences there is a need for reliable hypoxia monitoring. Electroencephalography (EEG) is being investigated as a real time monitor for multiple diving problems related to inspired gas, including hypoxia.
A systematic literature search identified articles investigating the relationship between EEG changes and acute cerebral hypoxia in healthy adults. Quality of clinical evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
Eighty-one studies were included for analysis. Only one study investigated divers. Twelve studies described quantitative EEG spectral power differences. Moderate hypoxia tended to result in increased alpha activity. With severe hypoxia, alpha activity decreased whilst delta and theta activities increased. However, since studies that utilised cognitive testing during the hypoxic exposure more frequently reported opposite results it appears cognitive processing might mask hypoxic EEG changes. Other analysis techniques (evoked potentials and electrical equivalents of dipole signals), demonstrated sustained regulation of autonomic responses despite worsening hypoxia. Other studies utilised quantitative EEG analysis techniques, (Bispectral index [BISTM], approximate entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity). No change was reported in BISTM value, whilst an increase in approximate entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity occurred with worsening hypoxia.
Electroencephalographic frequency patterns change in response to acute cerebral hypoxia. There is paucity of literature on the relationship between quantitative EEG analysis techniques and cerebral hypoxia.

37673590,Development of a Bispectral index score prediction model based on an interpretable deep learning algorithm.,Artificial intelligence in medicine,2023,"Hwang E, Park HS, Kim HS, Kim JY, Jeong H, Kim J, Kim SH","Proper maintenance of hypnosis is crucial for ensuring the safety of patients undergoing surgery. Accordingly, indicators, such as the Bispectral index (BIS), have been developed to monitor hypnotic levels. However, the black-box nature of the algorithm coupled with the hardware makes it challenging to understand the underlying mechanisms of the algorithms and integrate them with other monitoring systems, thereby limiting their use.
We propose an interpretable deep learning model that forecasts BIS values 25 s in advance using 30 s electroencephalogram (EEG) data.
The proposed model utilized EEG data as a predictor, which is then decomposed into amplitude and phase components using fast Fourier Transform. An attention mechanism was applied to interpret the importance of these components in predicting BIS. The predictability of the model was evaluated on both regression and binary classification tasks, where the former involved predicting a continuous BIS value, and the latter involved classifying a dichotomous status at a BIS value of 60. To evaluate the interpretability of the model, we analyzed the attention values expressed in the amplitude and phase components according to five ranges of BIS values. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using datasets collected from two separate medical institutions.
The proposed model achieved excellent performance on both the internal and external validation datasets. The model achieved a root-mean-square error of 6.614 for the regression task, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.937 for the binary classification task. Interpretability analysis provided insight into the relationship between EEG frequency components and BIS values. Specifically, the attention mechanism revealed that higher BIS values were associated with increased amplitude attention values in high-frequency bands and increased phase attention values in various frequency bands. This finding is expected to facilitate a more profound understanding of the BIS prediction mechanism, thereby contributing to the advancement of anesthesia technologies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37673590/

This is an ongoing debate since more than 25 years, representing a scientific, cultural as well as geographical divide in the anesthesia community. The Pro side argues that total intravenous anesthesia causes less postoperative nausea and higher patient satisfaction than anesthesia using volatile anesthetics. Target-controlled infusion (TCI) of anesthetic agents allows for better titration of intravenous anesthesia using pharmacokinetic models. Processed EEG monitors, such as bispectral index monitoring, allows for better assessing the effect of TCI anesthesia than solely assessment of clinical parameters, such as ECG or blood pressure. The combination of TCI propofol and objective depth of anesthesia monitoring allows creating a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile for each patient. Finally, anesthesia using volatile anesthetics poses health risks for healthcare professionals and contributes to greenhouse effect. The Con side argues that for procedures accompanied with ischemia and reperfusion injury of an organ or tissue and for patients suffering from a severe inflammation' the use of volatile anesthetics might well have its advantages above propofol. In times of sudden shortage of drugs, volatile anesthetics can overcome the restriction in the operating theater or even on the intensive care unit, which is another advantage. Volatile anesthetics can be used for induction of anesthesia when IV access is impossible, end-tidal measurements of volatile anesthetic concentration allows confirmation that patients receive anesthetics. Taking environmental considerations into account, both propofol and volatile anesthetics bear certain harm to the environment, be it as waste product or as greenhouse gases. The authors therefore suggest to carefully considering advantages and disadvantages for each patient in its according environment. A well-balanced choice based on the available literature is recommended. The authors recommend careful consideration of advantages and disadvantages of each technique when tailoring an anesthetic to meet patient needs.

We have shown that the potential for improving the pharmacokinetic model is minimal. The drug titration paradox revealed that titration challenges the classical relationship between drug dose and effect in both individuals and the population. We hypothesised that dynamic factors during surgery beyond the static genetic, epigenetic, and other factors such as age, height, and weight affect the necessary dose. We compared the variability of measured end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations with predicted effect-site propofol concentrations when titrated to a BIS range of 40-60, with the hypothesis that the variability in measured sevoflurane concentrations would not be less than the variability in estimated propofol concentrations.
Clinical data from 2280 surgical procedures >1 h in duration were included in the analysis. Anaesthesia with sevoflurane or propofol was based on an institutional protocol. The titration performance for both drugs was assessed by comparing BIS values 30 min after skin incision. The variability of the required concentrations at the same time point was calculated and compared.
The achieved 30-min post-incision BIS ranges were not significantly different for sevoflurane or propofol TCI (30 [99% CI: 28-33] and 31 [99% CI: 27-36], respectively). The variability of sevoflurane concentrations was not significantly different from measured predicted propofol concentrations during BIS-guided anaesthesia (normalized concentration range of 0.89 [99% CI: 0.78-0.99] and 0.93 [99% CI 0.87-1.02).

Variational mode decomposition (VMD) searches for IMFs by optimizing the bandwidth to a narrow band with the [Formula: see text] norm while preserving the online estimated central frequency. In this study, we applied VMD to the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during general anesthesia. Using a bispectral index monitor, EEGs were recorded from 10 adult surgical patients (the median age: 47.0, and the percentile range: 27.0-59.3 years) who were anesthetized with sevoflurane. We created an application named EEG Mode Decompositor, which decomposes the recorded EEG into IMFs and displays the Hilbert spectrogram. Over the 30-min recovery from general anesthesia, the median (25-75 percentile range) bispectral index increased from 47.1 (42.2-50.4) to 97.4 (96.5-97.6), and the central frequencies of IMF-1 showed a significant change from 0.4 (0.2-0.5) Hz to 0.2 (0.1-0.3) Hz.

As increasingly acknowledged, its effectiveness is subject dependent, which may lead to time consuming and cost ineffective treatment development phases. We propose the combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and unsupervised learning for the stratification and prediction of individual responses to tDCS. A randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind crossover study design was conducted within a clinical trial for the development of pediatric treatments based on tDCS. The tDCS stimulation (sham and active) was applied either in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or in the right inferior frontal gyrus. Following the stimulation session, participants performed 3 cognitive tasks to assess the response to the intervention: the Flanker Task, N-Back Task and Continuous Performance Test (CPT). We used data from 56 healthy children and adolescents to implement an unsupervised clustering approach that stratify participants based on their resting-state EEG spectral features before the tDCS intervention. We then applied a correlational analysis to characterize the clusters of EEG profiles in terms of participant's difference in the behavioral outcome (accuracy and response time) of the cognitive tasks when performed after a tDCS-sham or a tDCS-active session. Better behavioral performance following the active tDCS session compared to the sham tDCS session is considered a positive intervention response, whilst the reverse is considered a negative one. Optimal results in terms of validity measures was obtained for 4 clusters. These results show that specific EEG-based digital phenotypes can be associated to particular responses. While one cluster presents neurotypical EEG activity, the remaining clusters present non-typical EEG characteristics, which seem to be associated with a positive response. Findings suggest that unsupervised machine learning can be successfully used to stratify and eventually predict responses of individuals to a tDCS treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37231030/

By comparison, the electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrogram enables the visualization of the brain response during anesthesia and may prevent unnecessary anesthetic consumption.
This retrospective study included 140 adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy who received total intravenous anesthesia using a combination of propofol and dexmedetomidine infusions. Patients were equally matched to the spectrogram group (maintaining the robust EEG alpha power during surgery) or the index group (maintaining the BIS score between 40 and 60 during surgery) based on the propensity score of age and surgical type. The primary outcome was the propofol dose. Secondary outcome was the postoperative neurological profile.

Anaesthesia and postoperative sedation may obscure clinical symptoms of stroke and thus delay diagnosis and timely intervention.
The objective was to assess the value of intra-operative neuromonitoring and blood pressure monitoring for predicting the occurrence of peri-operative stroke within 3 days after cardiothoracic surgery.
Single-centre retrospective observational cohort study.
Academic tertiary care medical centre.
All consecutive patients with cardiothoracic surgery and intra-operative neuromonitoring admitted postoperatively to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) between 2008 and 2017.
The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any stroke confirmed by brain imaging within 3 days postcardiothoracic surgery. Areas under the curve (AUC) of intra-operative mean arterial pressure (MAP), cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO 2 ) and bispectral index (BIS) below predefined thresholds were calculated, and the association with early stroke was tested using logistic regression analyses.
A total of 2454 patients admitted to the ICU after cardiothoracic surgery had complete intra-operative data for ScO 2 , BIS and MAP and were included in the analysis. In 58 patients (2.4%), a stroke was confirmed. In univariate analysis, a larger AUC MAP<60 mmHg [odds ratio (OR) 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.21 to 1.68) and larger AUC BIS<25 (OR 1.51; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.83) were associated with the occurrence of postoperative stroke while ScO 2 less than 50% or greater than 20% reduction from individual baseline was not (OR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.67).

Recently, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) was introduced to analyze nonlinear and nonstationary data. In this study, we assessed whether the changes in EEG characteristics during general anesthesia that are analyzed by the HHT are useful for monitoring the depth of anesthesia.
This retrospective observational study enrolled patients who underwent propofol anesthesia. Raw EEG signals were obtained from a monitor through a previously developed software application. We developed an HHT analyzer to decompose the EEG signal into six intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and estimated the instantaneous frequencies (HHT_IF) for each IMF. Changes over time in the raw EEG waves and parameters such as HHT_IF, BIS, spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), and electromyogram parameter (EMGlow) were assessed, and a Gaussian process regression model was created to assess the association between BIS and HHT_IF.
We analyzed EEG signals from 30 patients. The beta oscillation frequency range (13-25 Hz) was detected in IMF1 and IMF2 during the awake state, then after loss of consciousness, the frequency decreased and alpha oscillation (8-12 Hz) was detected in IMF2. At the emergence phase, the frequency increased and beta oscillations were detected in IMF1, IMF2, and IMF3. BIS and EMGlow changed significantly during the induction and emergence phases, whereas SEF95 showed a wide variability and no significant changes during the induction phase. The root mean square error between the observed BIS values and the values predicted by a Gaussian process regression model ranged from 4.69 to 9.68.
We applied the HHT to EEG analyses during propofol anesthesia. The instantaneous frequency in IMF1 and IMF2 identified changes in EEG characteristics during induction and emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, the HHT_IF in IMF2 showed strong associations with BIS and was suitable for depicting the alpha oscillation. Our study suggests that the HHT is useful for monitoring the depth of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37059989/

The cerebral oxygen extraction ratio (CERO2), jugular bulb venous saturation (SjvO2), and difference in arteriovenous oxygen (Da-jvO2) were measured at T0, T1, and T2. One day before surgery, and 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery, postoperative cognitive dysfunction was assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE).
Compared with T0, the Da-jvO2 and CERO2 values were decreased, and SjvO2 was increased in the 2 groups at T1 and T2 (P < .05). There was no statistical difference in the SjvO2, Da-jvO2, and CERO2 values between T1 and T2.

We took 52 EEG signals showing intraoperative patterns of diminished anaesthesia, similar to those that occur during emergence (after surgery) and subjected them to analysis by five commercially available monitors.
We compared five monitors (BIS, Entropy-SE, Narcotrend, qCON, and Sedline) to see if index values remained within, or moved out of, each monitors' recommended index range for general anaesthesia for at least 2 min during a period of supposed lighter anaesthesia, as observed by changes in the EEG spectrogram obtained in a previous study.
Of the 52 cases, 27 (52%) had at least one monitor warning of potentially inadequate hypnosis (index above range) and 16 of the 52 cases (31%) had at least one monitor signifying excessive hypnotic depth (index below clinical range). Of the 52 cases, only 16 (31%) showed concordance between all five monitors. Nineteen cases (36%) had one monitor discordant compared with the remaining four, and 17 cases (33%) had two monitors in disagreement with the remaining three.
Many clinical providers still rely on index values and manufacturer's recommended ranges for titration decision making.

The main task of the anesthesiologist is to assess the depth of anesthesia, or, more specifically, the depth of hypnosis (DoH), and accordingly adjust the dose of intravenous anesthetic agents. However, it is not possible to directly measure the anesthetic agent concentrations or the DoH, so the anesthesiologist must rely on various vital signs and EEG-based measurements, such as the bispectral (BIS) index. The ability to better measure DoH is directly applicable in clinical practice-it improves the anesthesiologist's assessment of the patient state regarding anesthetic agent concentrations and, consequently, the effects, as well as provides the basis for closed-loop control algorithms. This article introduces a novel structure for modeling DoH, which employs a residual dynamic model. The improved model can take into account the patient's individual sensitivity to the anesthetic agent, which is not the case when using the available population-data-based models. The improved model was tested using real clinical data. The results show that the predictions of the BIS-index trajectory were improved considerably. The proposed model thus seems to provide a good basis for a more patient-oriented individualized assessment of DoH, which should lead to better administration methods that will relieve the anesthesiologist's workload and will benefit the patient by providing improved safety, individualized treatment, and, thus, alleviation of possible adverse effects during and after surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36616891/

We applied a data-driven method called connectome predictive modeling (CPM) to identify networks relating to trait BAS and BIS and tested whether the strength of those networks predicted trait BAS and BIS in novel subjects using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. Adult participants (N = 107) completed a resting state task with eyes closed and eyes open, and trait BAS and BIS were measured via Carver and White's (1994) BIS and BAS scales. We hypothesized distinct positive (more synchronization) and negative (less synchronization) networks would relate to trait BAS and BIS. For eyes closed, we identified two negative networks, one in theta and one in alpha predicted BIS. We identified three positive networks, one in theta and one in beta predicted Fun Seeking and one in theta predicted Drive.

We acquired 21-electrode EEG data and bispectral index (BIS) values of 50 patients undergoing surgery from before anesthesia induction until after patient arousal. For each epoch of a 10.24-s window with 1-s offsets, we calculated frontal alpha power [Formula: see text], occipital alpha power [Formula: see text], and their difference [Formula: see text] to quantify anteriorization.

A total of 80 elderly patients aged 65 and above who underwent laparoscopic radical gastrectomy in our hospital were by convenience sampling and randomly divided into two groups : 55 groups ( group H ) and 45 groups ( group L ), 40 cases in each group. The depth of anesthesia was maintained using a closed-loop target-controlled infusion system: the EEG bispectral index was set to 55 in the H group and 45 in the L group. Venous blood samples were collected 2 h (T2), 24 h (T3) and 72 h (T4) after the start of surgery. The intraoperative dosage of propofol and remifentanil, operation duration, postoperative PACU stay time, intraoperative consciousness occurrence, postoperative hospital stay and postoperative pulmonary inflammatory events were recorded.
The patient characteristic of the two groups had no statistical difference and were comparable (P > 0.05). The intraoperative dosage of propofol in group H was lower than that in group L (P < 0.05). Compared with the L group, the plasma IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations in the H group were significantly increased at T2 (P < 0.05), and the plasma IL-10 concentration was significantly increased at T4 (P < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in both groups at T2, T3 and T4 than at T1, while at T4, the concentration of TNF-α in group H was higher than at T1 (P < 0.05).
When the BIS value of the depth of anesthesia is 45, the perioperative release of inflammatory factors in elderly patients with laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer is less than BIS 55, and does not affect the prognosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36284289/

Tertiary university hospital operating room.
Forty-two patients aged 20-80 years who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery under spinal anesthesia and had American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I to III were enrolled in this study.
Dexmedetomidine was administered with a loading dose of 0.5-1 μg/kg for 10 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.3-0.6 μg/kg/h.
The depth of sedation was assessed using the modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (MOAA/S) scale; the data for PLE and BIS were collected; and vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, EKG, and pulse oximetry, were evaluated.
215,082 data points for the MOAA/S score and PLE and BIS values were analyzed. The baseline variabilities of PLE and BIS were 4.53% and 7.02%, respectively. The Spearman correlation coefficients of the MOAA/S score with PLE and BIS were 0.599 and 0.566, respectively. The prediction probabilities of the MOAA/S score with PLE and BIS were 0.647 and 0.636, respectively.

In this study, we propose an intelligence model that predicts the DoA from a single channel electroencephalograph (EEG) signal. A segmentation technique based on a sliding window is employed to partition EEG signals. Hierarchical dispersion entropy (HDE) is applied to each EEG segment. A set of features is extracted from each EEG segment. The extracted features are investigated using a community graph detection approach (CGDA), and the most relevant features are selected to trace the DoA. The proposed model, based on HDE coupled with CGDA, is evaluated in term of BIS index using several statistical metrics such Q-Q plot, regression, and correlation coefficients. In addition, the proposed model is evaluated against the BIS index in the case of the poor signal quality. The results demonstrated that the proposed model showed an earlier reaction compared with the BIS index when patient's state transits from deep anaesthesia to moderate anaesthesia in the case of poor signal quality. The highest Pearson correlation coefficient obtained by the proposed is 0.96.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35790625/

However, these monitors are vulnerable to artefacts. In addition to the processed number, the raw frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) can be displayed as a curve on the same monitor. Anaesthesia practitioners can learn to interpret the EEG in a short tutorial and may be quicker and more accurate thanBIS in assessing anaesthesia depth by recognising EEG patterns. We hypothesise that quality of recovery (QoR) in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery is better, if propofol is titrated by anaesthesia practitioners able to interpret the EEG.
This is a multicentre, double-blind (patients and outcome assessors) randomised controlled trial taking place in four Swiss hospitals. Patients aged 18 years or older undergoing laparoscopic procedures with general anaesthesia using propofol and anaesthesia practitioners with more than 2 years experience will be eligible. The primary study outcome is the difference in QoR 24 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes are propofol consumption, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and postoperative delirium.QoR and propofol consumption are compared between both groups using a two-sample t-test. Fisher's exact test is used to compare the incidences of PONV and delirium. A total of 200 anaesthesia practitioners (and 200 patients) are required to have an 80% chance of detecting the minimum relevant difference for the QoR-15 as significant at the 5% level assuming a SD of 20.
Ethical approval has been obtained from all responsible ethics committees (lead committee: Ethikkommission Nordwest- und Zentralschweiz, 16 January 2021). The findings of the trial will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at international conferences, and may lead to a change in titrating propofol in clinical practice.

Similarly, although resting-state electroencephalogram (rsEEG) brain oscillatory activity has been associated with various neuropsychological disorders and behaviours, these issues have not been assessed in perimenopausal women. This study aimed to evaluate quantitative relationships between psychometric properties and rsEEG rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma powers) in perimenopausal women.
A cross-sectional correlational descriptive study was conducted to quantitatively analyze the correlations between rsEEG low-to-high band activities (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma powers) and psychometric properties in 14 perimenopausal women. Participants completed a psychological inventory comprising the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI), Depression Inventory (DI), Behavioural Inhibition Scale (BIS) and short-form UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale (IS) before EEG recording.
Results showed that impulsivity was positively related to the beta power, symmetrical at most channels (frontal, temporal, central, parietal and occipital regions; p < .05); but did not related to the delta, theta, alpha and gamma powers. The brainwave low-to-high bands, delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma power were not associated with DI, SAI or BIS scores.

The primary aim of the study was to compare the response of the Bispectral Index (BIS) during emergence from anesthesia maintained by xenon and sevoflurane. To better understand the variation in response of pEEG to these agents, we also compared several EEG derived parameters relevant to pEEG monitoring during emergence. Twenty-four participants scheduled for lithotripsy were randomized to receive xenon or sevoflurane anesthesia. Participants were monitored with the BIS and had simultaneous raw EEG collected. BIS index values were compared at three key emergence timepoints: first response, eyes open and removal of airway. Two sets of EEG derived parameters, three related to the BIS: relative beta ratio, SynchFastSlow and SynchFastSlow biocoherence, and two unrelated to the BIS: spectral edge frequency and the composite cortical state, were calculated for comparison. BIS index values were significantly lower in the xenon group than the sevoflurane group at each emergence timepoint. The relative beta ratio parameter increased significantly during emergence in the sevoflurane group but not in the xenon group. The spectral edge frequency and composite cortical state parameters increased significantly in both groups during emergence. The BIS index is lower at equivalent stages of behavioural response during emergence from xenon anesthesia when compared to sevoflurane anesthesia, most likely due to differences in how these two agents influence the relative beta ratio. The spectral edge frequency and composite cortical state might better reflect emergence from xenon anaesthesia.Clinical trial number and registry Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Number: ACTRN12618000916246.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441313/

However, the impact of carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum on the body during laparoscopic surgery has attracted the attention of many scholars. Pneumoperitoneum can cause increased cerebral blood flow and increased intracranial pressure, cerebral metabolic rate is highly correlated with blood carbon dioxide partial pressure, and cerebral metabolism without cardiopulmonary bypass is linearly correlated with the depth of anesthesia. Electroencephalographic (EEG) bispectral index (BIS) is a signal analysis method, which can directly measure the effect of drugs on the cerebral cortex and reflect the depth of anesthesia. Based on this, this study takes smart medical treatment as the background and uses the improved BP neural network as a tool to explore the effect of carbon dioxide on EEG bispectral index under intravenous target-controlled anesthesia. The main purpose is to observe the correlation between arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure and EEG bispectral index under propofol target-controlled anesthesia during retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery. The experimental results show that the model proposed in this study can efficiently and accurately obtain the size of the influencing factors, which provides a clinical basis for the anesthesia management and anesthesia depth regulation of carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum laparoscopic surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35388314/

We investigated the long-term effects of personalized, multisession, stereotactic-EEG (SEEG)-targeted multichannel tDCS on seizure frequency (SF) and functional connectivity (Fc) as measured by EEG in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE).
Ten patients suffering from DRE were recruited. Multichannel tDCS (Starstim, Neuroelectrics) was applied during three cycles (one cycle every 2 months) of stimulation. Each cycle consisted of five consecutive days where patients received tDCS daily in two 20 min sessions separated by 20 min. The montages were personalized to target epileptogenic area of each patient as defined by SEEG recordings. SF during and after treatment was compared with baseline. Fc changes were analysed using scalp EEG recordings.
After the last tDCS session, five patients experienced a SF decrease of 50% or more compared with baseline (R: responders, average SF decrease of 74%). We estimated Fc changes between cycles and across R and non-responder (NR) patients. R presented a significant decrease in Fc (p < 0.05) at the third session in alpha and beta frequency bands compared to the first one.

There has been great interest in the anesthesia community regarding whether variables generated by commercially available processed EEG monitors originally marketed to prevent awareness under anesthesia can be used to guide intraoperative anesthetic management to prevent POCD. Processed EEG monitors represent an opportunity for anesthesiologists to directly monitor the brain even if they have not been trained to interpret EEG waveforms. There is continued equipoise regarding whether any of the variables generated by the machines' interpretation of raw data are associated with POCD. Most literature has focused on the depth of anesthesia number, however recent studies have shown that processed depth may not be accurate in older age groups due to reduced alpha band power. Burst suppression is an encephalographic pattern of high voltage activity alternating with periods of electrical silence and is another marker of depth which can be obtained from commercial processed EEG monitors. We performed a prospective cohort study to determine whether burst suppression and burst suppression ratio as measured by the BIS Monitor (Bispectral Index, BIS Medtronic, Boulder CO), is associated with cognitive dysfunction 3 months after surgery. We recruited 167 elective surgery patients, 65 years of age and older, anticipated to require at least 2 day inpatient admission. Our main outcome measure was cognitive decline in composite z-score on the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center UDS Battery of at least 1 standard deviation 3 months after surgery relative to preoperative baseline. 14% experienced POCD, this group was older (72 [70, 74] versus 70 [67, 75] years), and had frailty scores as measured by the FRAIL Scale (2 [0, 3] versus 1 [0, 2]) and lower baseline z-scores (- 0.2 [- 0.6, 0.5] versus 0.1 [- 0.3, 0.5]). There was a univariable association between suppression ratio > 10 (SR > 10) and POCD (4.8 [0, 37.3] versus 15.4 [4.0-142.4] min), p = .038. However, after adjustment this relationship did not persist, only anesthetic technique, age, and pain remained in the model. In our cohort of older elective noncardiac surgery patients we found a marginal association between processed burst suppression (total burst suppression p = .067, SR > 5 p = .052, SR > 10.038) which did not persist in a multivariable model. Patients with POCD had almost twice the number of minutes of burst suppression, and three times the amount of time for SR > 5 and > 10. Our finding may be a limitation of the monitor's ability to detect burst suppression. The consistent trend towards more intraoperative burst suppression in patients who developed POCD suggests that future studies are needed to investigate the relationship of raw intraoperative burst suppression and POCD.Trial registry Clinical trial number and registry URL: Optimizing Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction in the Elderly-PRESERVE, Clinical Trials Gov# NCT02650687; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02650687 .",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34862586/

Propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with target-controlled infusion (TCI) is relatively easy to practice. While this technique promotes a higher overall anesthesia quality and patient survival, especially for cancer patients, there are deficiencies in training and education of the technique. Therefore, the Society for Intravenous Anesthesia and the Association of Anesthetists (United Kingdom) have laid out guidelines in an attempt to highlight multiple important TIVA-related safety issues to help clinicians feel more confident. In the present article, we discuss five recommendations and four special clinical situations. Preparation, equipment familiarity, and safe delivery techniques are extremely important for the proper employment of this method. Herein, we emphasize the importance of proper education, and the clinical practice experience of the TIVA technique. Additionally, we suggest a modified connection method to set up a safely administered line. We highlight the advantages of using processed electroencephalogram monitoring (such as bispectral index or Entropy) to prevent awareness during TIVA administration in difficult clinical situations. These situations may include triple low patients (e.g., low blood pressure, low maintained effect-site concentration of propofol, and low body weight ≤ 18), obese patients, and patients with difficult infusion site monitoring or use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Due to a limited consensus among Taiwanese medical professionals, this document is intended to act as a safe practice reference for the use of TIVA with TCI. Additionally, two pithy formula codes, 4321 for propofol with fentanyl/alfentanil and 42222111 for propofol with remifentanil, are provided for the general population and one pithy formula code, 4321 for propofol with fentanyl, is provided for pediatric patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856739/

Direct BIS values from a disposable BIS electrode and indirect values via the interface device were simultaneously recorded from the same areas of electrode placement in a single patient. The agreement between the direct and indirect BIS values was statistically analyzed.
The interface device with a silver electrode demonstrated sufficient electric conduction to transmit electroencephalogram signals.

However, whether anxiety levels have a direct effect on language processing has not been so consistently explored. The present study focuses on event-related potential (ERP) patterns resulting from electroencephalographic (EEG) measurement of participants' (n = 36) brain activity while they perform a dichotic listening task. Participants' anxiety level was measured via a behavioural inhibition system scale (BIS). Later, participants listened to dichotically paired sentences, one neutral and the other threatening, and indicated at which ear they heard the threatening stimulus. Threatening sentences expressed threat semantically-only, prosodically-only, or both combined (congruent threat). ERPs showed a late positivity, interpreted as a late positive complex (LPC). Results from Bayesian hierarchical models provided strong support for an association between LPC and BIS score. This was interpreted as an effect of trait anxiety on deliberation processes. We discuss two possible interpretations. On the one hand, verbal repetitive thinking, as associated with anxious rumination and worry, can be the mechanism disrupting late phase deliberation processes. Instantiated by inner speech, verbal repetitive thinking might be the vehicle of anxiety-related reappraisal and/or rehearsal. On the other hand, increased BIS could be simply affecting an extended evaluation stage as proposed by multistep models, maybe due to over-engagement with threat or to task-related effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34553432/

This indicates that there is an urgent need to moderate the level of anesthesia. Recently deep learning (DL) methods have played a major role in estimating the depth of Anesthesia (DOA) of patients and has played an essential role in control anesthesia overdose. In this paper, Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been used for the prediction of DOA. EEG signals are very complex signals which may require months of training and advanced signal processing techniques. It is a point of debate whether DL methods are an improvement over the already existing traditional EEG signal processing approaches. One of the DL algorithms is Convolutional neural network (CNN) which is very popular algorithm for object recognition and is widely growing its applications in processing hierarchy in the human visual system. In this paper, various decomposition methods have been used for extracting the features EEG signal. After acquiring the necessary signals values in image format, several CNN models have been deployed for classification of DOA depending upon their Bispectral Index (BIS) and the signal quality index (SQI). The EEG signals were converted into the frequency domain using and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). However, because of the inter mode mixing observed in EMD method; EEMD have been utilized for this study. The developed CNN models were used to predict the DOA based on the EEG spectrum images without the use of handcrafted features which provides intuitive mapping with high efficiency and reliability. The best trained model gives an accuracy of 83.2%. Hence, this provides further scope and research which can be carried out in the domain of visual mapping of DOA using EEG signals and DL methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34517477/

Objective, reliable tools are needed to guide treatment decisions and prioritize resources.
This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the bispectral index (BIS) in comatose patients with severe brain injury.
This was a retrospective cohort study of 84 patients with severe brain injury and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 8 and less treated from January 2015 to June 2017. Sedatives were withheld at least 24 hr before BIS scoring. The BIS value, GCS scores, and Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) were monitored hourly for 48 hr. Based on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score, the patients were divided into poor (GOS score: 1-2) and good prognosis groups (GOS score: 3-5). The correlation between BIS and prognosis was analyzed by logistic regression, and the receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted.
The mean (SD) of the BIS value: 54.63 (11.76), p = .000; and GCS score: 5.76 (1.87), p = .000, were higher in the good prognosis group than in the poor prognosis group. Lower BIS values and GCS scores were correlated with poorer prognosis. Based on the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal diagnostic cutoff value of the BIS was 43.6, and the associated sensitivity and specificity were 85.4% and 74.4%, respectively.
Taken together, our study indicates that BIS had good predictive value on prognosis. These findings suggested that BIS could be used to evaluate the severity and prognosis of severe brain injury.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34491945/

They are particularly at risk of developing postoperative neurocognitive disorders (NCD). Earlier studies suggested that processed electroencephalographic (EEG) monitors may reduce the incidence of postoperative NCD. However, none of these studies controlled for intraoperative nociception levels or personalized blood pressure targets. Their results remain unclear if the reduction in the incidence of postoperative NCD relates to avoidance of any electroencephalographic pattern suggesting excessive anesthesia depth.
The objective of this trial is to investigate-in patients ≥ 70 years old undergoing major non-cardiac surgery-the effect of EEG-guided anesthesia on postoperative NCD while controlling for intraoperative nociception, personalized blood pressure targets, and using detailed information provided by the EEG monitor (including burst suppression ratio, density spectral array, and raw EEG waveform).
This prospective, randomized, controlled trial will be conducted in a single Canadian university hospital. Patients ≥ 70 years old undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery will be included in the trial. The administration of sevoflurane will be adjusted to maintain a BIS index value between 40 and 60, to keep a Suppression Ratio (SR) at 0%, to keep a direct EEG display without any suppression time and a spectrogram with most of the EEG wave frequency within the alpha, theta, and delta frequencies in the EEG-guided group. In the control group, sevoflurane will be administered to achieve an age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration of [0.8-1.2]. In both groups, a nociception monitor will guide intraoperative opioid administration, individual blood pressure targets will be used, and cerebral oximetry used to tailor intraoperative hemodynamic management. The primary endpoint will be the incidence of NCD at postoperative day 1, as evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Secondary endpoints will include the incidence of postoperative NCD at different time points and the evaluation of cognitive trajectories up to 90 days after surgery among EEG-guided and control groups.

The BIS has been demonstrated as inaccurate when neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) are used. Compared with BIS, phase lag entropy (PLE), which measures the anesthetic depth based on a 4-channel EEG signal, is less affected by EMG. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of EMG activity during emergence on anesthetic depth monitoring between PLE and BIS.
Twenty five consecutive patients with physical status I-II of American Society of Anesthesiologists undergoing general anesthesia (age range, 20-60 years). The anesthesiologist attached the sensors of BIS and PLEM 100 on the patient's forehead. NMB reversal was performed by intravenously injecting sugammadex after confirmation of shallow NMB (TOF count 1-4) under neuromuscular monitoring. The BIS and PLE scores were recorded with neuromuscular monitoring at 1-min intervals for 5 min after administration of sugammadex.
The BIS and BIS-EMG measured at 1 min after sugammadex injection were significantly higher at 1 min [51.650 (46.100, 62.225) (P<0.001); 28.500 (27.800, 31.075) (P=0.003)] than at 0 min. However, there was no between-time point difference in the PLE score and PLE-EMG (P=0.0843, P=0.329).
In general anesthesia using propofol-remifentanil, the BIS at 1 min after sugammadex reversal during emergence appears to be more affected by EMG activity than the PLE score. Therefore, immediately after sugammadex administration (within 1 min), it may be clinically useful to evaluate the consciousness status through the PLE score.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34328012/

Suppressive actions of the brain to terminate the seizure are thought to be necessary for the efficacy of ECT. On the other hand, recent studies showed an association of burst suppression in general anesthesia or sedation with (postprocedural) cognitive complications.
We retrospectively examined the length of postictal burst suppression and reorientation time in 49 ECT sessions of 25 consecutive patients. Burst suppression duration was determined by bispectral index monitoring and defined as the time with a bispectral index value of less than 20%. The association between duration of burst suppression and reorientation time was analyzed with multivariate logistic and linear regression analysis controlling for several covariates.
The reorientation time showed a statistically significant association with the duration of burst suppression, but with no other variable. Longer phase of postictal burst suppression predicted longer reorientation time in the recovery room (P = 0.046).
The association between the duration of postictal burst suppression and reorientation time after ECT in this sample suggests that (not only the efficacy but also the) cognitive adverse effects of ECT might be related to the extent of postictal central inhibition after the termination of the seizure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34294649/

The brain's response to anesthetic drugs is often measured clinically by processed electroencephalogram (EEG) indices. Thus, we developed a processed EEG-based measure of the brain's resistance to volatile anesthetics and hypothesized that low scores on it would be associated with postoperative delirium risk.
We defined the Duke Anesthesia Resistance Scale (DARS) as the average bispectral index (BIS) divided by the quantity (2.5 minus the average age-adjusted end-tidal minimum alveolar concentration [aaMAC] inhaled anesthetic fraction). The relationship between DARS and postoperative delirium was analyzed in 139 older surgical patients (age ≥65) from Duke University Medical Center (n = 69) and Mt Sinai Medical Center (n = 70). Delirium was assessed by geriatrician interview at Duke, and by research staff utilizing the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) instrument at Mt Sinai. We examined the relationship between DARS and delirium and used the Youden index to identify an optimal low DARS threshold (for delirium risk), and its associated 95% bootstrap confidence bounds. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the relationship between low DARS and delirium risk.
The relationship between DARS and delirium risk was nonlinear, with higher delirium risk at low DARS scores. A DARS threshold of 28.755 maximized the Youden index for the association between low DARS and delirium, with bootstrap 95% confidence bounds of 26.18 and 29.80. A low DARS (<28.755) was associated with increased delirium risk in multivariable models adjusting for site (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 4.30 [1.89-10.01]; P = .001), or site-plus-patient risk factors (OR [95% CI] = 3.79 [1.63-9.10]; P = .003). These associations with postoperative delirium risk remained significant when using the 95% bootstrap confidence bounds for the low DARS threshold (P < .05 for all). Further, a low DARS (<28.755) was associated with delirium risk after accounting for opioid, midazolam, propofol, phenylephrine, and ketamine dosage as well as site (OR [95% CI] = 4.21 [1.80-10.16]; P = .002). This association between low DARS and postoperative delirium risk after controlling for these other medications remained significant (P < .05) when using either the lower or the upper 95% bootstrap confidence bounds for the low DARS threshold.
These results demonstrate that an intraoperative processed EEG-based measure of lower brain anesthetic resistance (ie, low DARS) is independently associated with increased postoperative delirium risk in older surgical patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34252066/

Because these utilise EEG data, attempts have been made to investigate their use in diagnosing and monitoring seizures. This is important as formal EEG monitoring can be hard to obtain in many critical care environments. We undertook a scoping review of the evidence for using processed EEG (pEEG) from depth of anaesthesia monitors for this indication.
Medline, Psych INFO, and Embase were searched for peer-reviewed journals until 20 March 2021. Data and conclusions taken from the study of pEEG in both critical care and peri-operative settings have been included in a qualitative synthesis about the current evidence for the use of pEEG in the detection and monitoring of seizures.
Searches yielded 8 observational studies, 1 randomised trial and 15 case reports in which the use of pEEG in critical care and peri-operative medicine was described. Most concerned the Bispectral Index (BIS) device. The majority of observational studies reported the use of BIS for optimisation of burst suppression in patients with refractory status-epilepticus (RSE), or in the comparison of pEEG data with conventional EEG during epileptic activity. Multiple case reports describe the application of pEEG in the presence of disorders of consciousness as a tool for detection of non-convulsive status-epilepticus, finding variable trends in the pEEG output.
Processed EEG may be helpful in monitoring pharmacologically induced burst suppression. Despite this, its use in the diagnosing or monitoring seizure activity is controversial and currently not evidenced, with numerous confounding variables that requires systematic assessment in future studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34229228/

The most commonly used substances by adolescents include tobacco and cannabis, with some individuals using both substances, potentially heightening risk. Our objective was to examine feedback processing and impulsivity in adolescents who smoke cigarettes and use cannabis daily (N = 21), comparing them with adolescents who smoke cigarettes daily and use cannabis occasionally (N = 18) and non-smoking (N = 27) adolescents. To do this, the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) with concurrent EEG was used to measure risk-related feedback processing, and impulsivity was measured using the Barratt's impulsiveness scale (BIS-11).

These include postoperative cognitive dysfunction or delirium as well as cerebrovascular accidents. During surgery, it is essential to ensure an adequate degree of sedation and analgesia, and at the same time, to provide hemodynamic and respiratory stability in order to minimize neurological complications. In this context, the role of neuromonitoring in the operating room is gaining interest, even in the non-neurolosurgical population. The use of multimodal neuromonitoring can potentially reduce the occurrence of adverse effects during and after surgery, and optimize the administration of anesthetic drugs. In addition to the traditional focus on monitoring hemodynamic and respiratory systems during general anesthesia, the ability to constantly monitor the activity and maintenance of brain homeostasis, creating evidence-based protocols, should also become part of the standard of care: in this challenge, neuromonitoring comes to our aid.

As age is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD) the incidence of POD will increase concordantly. One approach to reduce the risk of POD would be to avoid excessively high doses of anaesthetics by using neuromonitoring to guide anaesthesia titration. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of patient's age on various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based anaesthesia indices.
We conducted an analysis of previously published data by replaying single electrode EEG episodes of maintenance of general anaesthesia from 180 patients (18-90 years; ASA I-IV) into the five different commercially available monitoring systems and evaluated their indices. We included the State/Response Entropy, Narcotrend, qCON/qNOX, bispectral index (BIS), and Treaton MGA-06. For a non-commercial comparison, we extracted the spectral edge frequency (SEF) from the BIS. To evaluate the influence of the age we generated linear regression models. We also assessed the correlation between the various indices.
During anaesthetic maintenance the values of the SEF, State/Response Entropy, qCON/qNOX and BIS all significantly increased (0.05 Hz/0.19-0.26 index points per year) with the patient's age (p < 0.001); whereas the Narcotrend did not change significantly with age (0.06 index points per year; p = 0.28). The index values of the Treaton device significantly decreased with age (-0.09 index points per year; p < 0.001). These findings were independent of the administered dose of anaesthetics.
Almost all current neuromonitoring devices are influenced by age, with the potential to result in inappropriately high dosage of anaesthetics.

This article first describes and classifies artificial intelligence, introduces its realization method, machine learning algorithms, and briefly introduces the basic principles of regression and classification methods in machine learning; then, the principles and techniques of general anesthetics are proposed. The pathogenesis of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is explained in detail. Finally, the effect of anesthetics on postoperative cognitive dysfunction is obtained from both inhaled anesthetics and intravenous anesthetics. The impact on postoperative cognitive function is explained. The experimental results in this article show that there is no statistically significant difference in the two groups of patients' age, gender ratio, body mass index, education level, preoperative comorbidities, and other general indicators. Through the use of EEG bispectral index monitors to monitor the depth of anesthesia and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, first, there was no obvious relationship between the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction at 1, 5, 10, and 50 days and discharge time. The comprehensive monitoring group can reduce the clinical dose of preventive medication and cis-atracurium and shorten the patient's recovery time, extubation time, and recovery time. In addition, it can also reduce the increase of serum protein S100",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33868620/

A number of studies have used such recordings for analysis, even though information about bandwidth and fidelity has not been provided by the manufacturers. In this study we consider these systems purely as EEG recording devices, and evaluate their suitability for quantitative analysis. Using a calibrated electronic testing system, we played an artificial test signal of known amplitude with frequency varying from 0.01 to 400 Hz into the BIS and Entropy EEG systems, and saved the recording in each of their supported recording modes. The amplitude of the recording at each frequency was then used to derive the frequency response curves, as well as the 3 dB and 0.5 dB points for each mode. There are important differences between the various BIS and Entropy recordings. The BIS 256 Hz and the Entropy 400 Hz recordings are broadly comparable, although Entropy has a slightly reduced response above 50 Hz and below 1 Hz. The BIS 128 Hz recording has a somewhat reduced bandwidth, due to its relatively low sampling rate. The Entropy 100 Hz recording in the Datex-Ohmeda S/5 monitor has a flawed implementation, leading to aliasing of signals over 50 Hz and potential distortion of the recording, while in the GE Carescape it has an uneven response and a narrowed bandwidth. Consequently, it is important to know which specific host monitor was used when an Entropy 100 Hz recording was made. In summary, the choice of recording device and host monitor may affect the results of some quantitative EEG analysis, and some previously published studies may need to be re-evaluated.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33860876/

To date, there is no effective medication that can improve social communication and interaction in ASD, and effect sizes of behaviour-based psychotherapy remain in the low to medium range. Consequently, there is a clear need for new treatment options. ASD is associated with altered activation and connectivity patterns in brain areas which process social information. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique that applies a weak electrical current to the brain in order to modulate neural excitability and alter connectivity. Combined with specific cognitive tasks, it allows to facilitate and consolidate the respective training effects. Therefore, application of tDCS in brain areas relevant to social cognition in combination with a specific cognitive training is a promising treatment approach for ASD.
A phase-IIa pilot randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group clinical study is presented, which aims at investigating if 10 days of 20-min multi-channel tDCS stimulation of the bilateral tempo-parietal junction (TPJ) at 2.0 mA in combination with a computer-based cognitive training on perspective taking, intention and emotion understanding, can improve social cognitive abilities in children and adolescents with ASD. The main objectives are to describe the change in parent-rated social responsiveness from baseline (within 1 week before first stimulation) to post-intervention (within 7 days after last stimulation) and to monitor safety and tolerability of the intervention. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of change in parent-rated social responsiveness at follow-up (4 weeks after end of intervention), change in other ASD core symptoms and psychopathology, social cognitive abilities and neural functioning post-intervention and at follow-up in order to explore underlying neural and cognitive mechanisms.
If shown, positive results regarding change in parent-rated social cognition and favourable safety and tolerability of the intervention will confirm tDCS as a promising treatment for ASD core-symptoms. This may be a first step in establishing a new and cost-efficient intervention for individuals with ASD.

However, the clinical assessment of anesthetic depth may not always agree with available processed EEG indices. To concurrently compare the performance of BIS and SedLine monitors, we present a data collection system using shared individual generic sensors connected to a custom-built passive interface box.
This prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized study will enroll 100 adult American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-III patients presenting for elective procedures requiring general anesthesia. BIS and SedLine electrodes will be placed preoperatively according to manufacturer recommendations and their respective indices tracked throughout anesthesia induction, maintenance and emergence. The concordance between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthesia depth will be analyzed with chi-square and kappa statistic.
Prior studies comparing brain function monitoring devices have applied both sensors on the forehead of study subjects simultaneously. With limited space and common sensor locations between devices, it is not possible to place both commercial sensor arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations, thus compromising the validity of these comparisons. This trial utilizes a custom interface allowing signals from sensors to be shared between BIS and SedLine monitors to provide an accurate comparison. Our results will also characterize the degree of agreement between processed EEG indices and clinical assessments of anesthetic depth as determined by the anesthesiologists' interpretations of acute changes in blood pressure and heart rate as well as the administration, or change to the continuous delivery, of medications at these timepoints. Patient factors (such as burst suppression state or low power EEG conditions from aging brain), surgical conditions (such as use of electrocautery), artifacts (such as electromyography), and anesthesia medications and doses (such as end-tidal concentration of volatile anesthetic or hypnotic infusion dose) that lead to lack of agreement will be explored as well.

However, few previous studies have investigated whether individual differences in motivation and impulsivity moderate the relationship between these disparate neural activity patterns. In a sample of 118 young adults, we used Electroencephalography (EEG) to examine whether behavioral activation and inhibition systems (BIS/BAS) and impulsivity facets (negative urgency, lack of perseverance), moderate the relationship between beta power and resting frontal alpha asymmetry. Regression analyses revealed a novel relationship between lesser beta power and greater left frontal alpha asymmetry (LFA). Moderation analyses suggest this relationship may strengthen as BIS/BAS levels increase, and trait impulsivity levels decrease from the mean. These results are among the first revealing a relationship between two widely investigated neural activity patterns of motivation and provide some indication individual differences moderate this relationship.

However, precise and real-time estimation of DOA index for painful surgical operations is challenging due to problems such as postoperative complications and accidental awareness. To tackle these problems, we propose a new combinatorial deep learning structure involving convolutional neural networks (inspired by the inception module), bidirectional long short-term memory, and an attention layer. The proposed model uses the EEG signal to continuously predicts the bispectral index (BIS). It is trained over a large dataset, mostly from those under general anesthesia with few cases receiving sedation/analgesia and spinal anesthesia. Despite the imbalance distribution of BIS values in different levels of anesthesia, our proposed structure achieves convincing root mean square error of 5.59 ± 1.04 and mean absolute error of 4.3 ± 0.87, as well as improvement in area under the curve of 15% on average, which surpasses state-of-the-art DOA estimation methods. The DOA values are also discretized into four levels of anesthesia and the results demonstrate strong inter-subject classification accuracy of 88.7% that outperforms the conventional methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33760743/

The core algorithmic software (the BIS Engine) can be retrieved from the motherboard of the A-2000 monitor in binary form through forensic disassembly using debugging interfaces left in place by the original designers, opening the possibility of executing the BIS algorithms on contemporary computers through emulation. Three steps were required for emulation. Firstly, the monitor input stage monitor was disassembled to determine how EEG signals can be compatibly presented to the Engine. Secondly, the Digital Signal Processor on which the Engine executes was recreated in software. Thirdly, the Engine code was patched, allowing execution separated from monitor hardware. Code performance under noise load was evaluated. EEG signals and BIS variables were obtained from a 13-year-old child in normal physiological sleep using a modern BIS monitor. BIS values in sleeping children exhibit a wide dynamic range, including values nominally associated with clinical anesthesia, providing a risk-free technique to obtain empirical EEG data that broadly exercise the algorithms. Emulation demonstrated a correlation coefficient of R = 0.943, consistent with correlations between official Engine iterations. Additive white noise in the EEG caused a progressive lifting and flattening of BIS values. Emulation replicates BIS Engine behavior, allowing calculation upon existing EEG datasets or signals from other, potentially remote or wireless, devices. Emulation provides advantages for elucidating the mathematical expression of the algorithms, which remain important as practical constraints on any hypothetical mechanism of action of anesthetics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33742345/

Few studies have compared EEG monitors on data from the same patient. Here, we describe a set-up to simultaneously compare the performance of three processed EEG monitors using pre-recorded EEG signals from older surgical patients.
A playback system was designed to replay EEG signals into three different commercially available EEG monitors. We could then simultaneously calculate indices from the SedLine® Root (Masimo Inc., Irvine, CA, USA; patient state index [PSI]), bilateral BIS VISTA™ (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA; bispectral index [BIS]), and Datex Ohmeda S/5 monitor with the Entropy™ Module (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA; E-entropy index [Entropy]). We tested the ability of each system to distinguish activity before anaesthesia administration (pre-med) and before/after loss of responsiveness (LOR), and to detect suppression incidences in EEG recorded from older surgical patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers. We show examples of processed EEG monitor output tested on 29 EEG recordings from older surgical patients.
All monitors showed significantly different indices and high effect sizes between comparisons pre-med to after LOR and before/after LOR. Both PSI and BIS showed the highest percentage of deeply anaesthetised indices during periods with suppression ratios (SRs) > 25%. We observed significant negative correlations between percentage of suppression and indices for all monitors (at SR >5%).
All monitors distinguished EEG changes occurring before anaesthesia administration and during LOR. The PSI and BIS best detected suppressed periods. Our results suggest that the PSI and BIS monitors might be preferable for older patients with risk factors for intraoperative awareness or increased sensitivity to anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33640118/

A total of 86 children were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) melatonin group (n = 43) and (2) chloral hydrate group (n = 43). BIS monitoring scores and sleep EEGs were recorded simultaneously. The effect of two drugs on sleep EEG recording was evaluated with sleep stages of EEG and BIS.
There was no statistically significant difference between the groups with regard to time to sleep onset and the need for a second drug ( P = 0.432; P = 1.000). Eight patients (18.6%) in chloral hydrate group reported side effects while there were no reported side effects in the melatonin group ( P = 0.006). Mean BIS values during EEG recordings were similar in both groups (59.72 ± 18.69 minutes and 66.17 ± 18.44 minutes, respectively, P = 1.000). The average time to achieve N2 sleep was 32.38 minutes in the chloral hydrate group and 43.25 minutes in the melatonin group ( P < 0.001). Both ""time spent in wakefulness"" and ""N1 sleep"" were found to be significantly higher in the melatonin group ( P < 0.001 and P = 0.005).

With this study we sought to find a mathematical explanation for this negative correlation between dose and effect, to confirm its existence with additional clinical data, and to explore it further with Monte Carlo simulations. Automatically recorded dosing and effect data from more than 9,000 patients was available for the analysis. The anesthetics propofol and sevoflurane and the catecholamine norepinephrine were titrated to defined effect targets, i.e., the processed electroencephalogram (Bispectral Index, BIS) and the blood pressure. A proportional control titration algorithm was developed for the simulations. We prove by deduction that the average dose-effect relationship during titration to the targeted effect will associate lower doses with greater effects. The finding of negative correlations between propofol and BIS, sevoflurane and BIS, and norepinephrine and mean arterial pressure confirmed the titration paradox. Monte Carlo simulations revealed two additional factors that contribute to the paradox. During stepwise titration toward a target effect, the slope of the dose-effect data for the population will be ""reversed,"" i.e., the correlation between dose and effect will not be positive, but will be negative, and will be ""horizontal"" when the titration is ""perfect."" The titration paradox must be considered whenever data from clinical titration (flexible dose) studies are interpreted.

Hence, it is speculated that acupuncture may have a sedative effect. However, existing studies employed acupuncture in combination with anesthetics, which makes determine acupuncture's role in producing sedation difficult. In this work, we investigated the sedative effect of acupuncture by using transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TAES) at bilateral Zusanli (ST36), Shenmen (HT7) and Sanyinjiao (SP6). Using a cross-over design, 2 separate sessions, that are, the resting and TAES sessions, were conducted for each subject. The sedative effect was quantified by using the bispectral index (BIS). The difference in brain activities between resting and TAES sessions was investigated by analyzing the simultaneously recorded EEG signals. Our results showed that a statistically significant difference in BIS values existed between resting and TAES sessions, which suggested that TAES alone was capable of inducing observable sedation. Using power spectrum analysis, we showed that TAES-induced sedation was accompanied by a reduction in alpha band power and an increment in delta band power. Permutation entropy was lower during the TAES session, which suggested that TAES reduced the complexity of the EEG signal. Moreover, a significant reduction in the global strength of brain functional connections was observed during TAES. These findings suggest that TAES alone can induce observable sedative effects, and this sedation effect is accompanied by changes in brain activities that have shown to be correlated with consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33256427/

The current analysis aimed to identify whether bispectral index (BIS) variations reliably reflect the actual depth of general anesthesia during presence of different types of epileptiform patterns (EPs) in EEGs during induction of general anesthesia.
Sixty patients receiving either VIGA with sevoflurane using increasing concentrations (group VIMA) or vital capacity (group VCRII) technique or intravenous single dose of propofol (group PROP) were included. Monitoring included facial electromyography (fEMG), fraction of inspired sevoflurane (FiAA), fraction of expired sevoflurane (FeAA), minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane, BIS, standard EEG, and hemodynamic parameters.
In the PROP group no EPs were observed. During different stages of VIGA with sevoflurane in the VIMA and VCRII groups, presence of polyspikes and rhythmic polyspikes in patients' EEGs resulted in artifactual BIS values indicating a false awareness/wakefulness from anesthesia, despite no concomitant change of FiAA, FeAA, and MAC of sevoflurane. Periodic epileptiform discharges did not result in aberrant BIS values.
Our results suggest that raw EEG correlate it with values of BIS, FiAA, FeAA, and MAC of sevoflurane during VIGA. It seems that because artifactual BIS values indicating false awareness/wakefulness as a result of presence of polyspikes and rhythmic polyspikes in patients' EEGs may be misleading to an anesthesiologist, leading to unintentional administration of toxic concentration of sevoflurane in ventilation gas.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33241952/

This study aimed to identify neurophysiological biomarkers of maintaining abstinence in alcohol-dependent individuals after alcohol treatment by investigating the resting-state EEG-based functional connectivity in the cognitive control network (CCN).
Lagged phase synchronization between CCN areas by means of eLORETA as well as the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were assessed in abstinent alcohol-dependent patients recruited from treatment centers. A preliminary prospective study design was used to classify participants into those who did and did not maintain abstinence during a follow-up period (median 12 months) after discharge from residential treatment.
Alcohol-dependent individuals, who maintained abstinence (N = 18), showed significantly increased lagged phase synchronization between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the left posterior parietal cortex (IPL) as well as between the right anterior insula cortex/frontal operculum (IA/FO) and the right inferior frontal junction (IFJ) in the delta band compared to those who later relapsed (N = 16). Regression analysis showed that the increased left frontoparietal delta connectivity in the early period of abstinence significantly predicted maintaining abstinence over the ensuing 12 months. Furthermore, right frontoinsular delta connectivity correlated negatively with impulsivity and depression measures.

33093360,A Forensic Disassembly of the BIS Monitor.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2020,Connor CW,"The bispectral index (BIS) monitor has been available for clinical use for >20 years and has had an immense impact on academic activity in Anesthesiology, with >3000 articles referencing the bispectral index. Despite attempts to infer its algorithms by external observation, its operation has nevertheless remained undescribed, in contrast to the algorithms of other less commercially successful monitors of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity under anesthesia. With the expiration of certain key patents, the time is therefore ripe to examine the operation of the monitor on its own terms through careful dismantling, followed by extraction and examination of its internal software.
An A-2000 BIS Monitor (gunmetal blue case, amber monochrome display) was purchased on the secondary market. After identifying the major data processing and storage components, a set of free or inexpensive tools was used to retrieve and disassemble the monitor's onboard software. The software executes primarily on an ARMv7 microprocessor (Sharp/NXP LH77790B) and a digital signal processor (Texas Instruments TMS320C32). The device software can be retrieved directly from the monitor's hardware by using debugging interfaces that have remained in place from its original development.
Critical numerical parameters such as the spectral edge frequency (SEF), total power, and BIS values were retraced from external delivery at the device's serial port back to the point of their calculation in the extracted software. In doing so, the locations of the critical algorithms were determined. To demonstrate the validity of the technique, the algorithms for SEF and total power were disassembled, comprehensively annotated and compared to their theoretically ideal behaviors. A bug was identified in the device's implementation of the SEF algorithm, which can be provoked by a perfectly isoelectric EEG.
This article demonstrates that the electronic design of the A-2000 BIS Monitor does not pose any insuperable obstacles to retrieving its device software in hexadecimal machine code form directly from the motherboard. This software can be reverse engineered through disassembly and decompilation to reveal the methods by which the BIS monitor implements its algorithms, which ultimately must form the definitive statement of its function. Without further revealing any algorithms that might be considered trade secrets, the manufacturer of the BIS monitor should be encouraged to release the device software in its original format to place BIS-related academic literature on a firm theoretical foundation and to promote further academic development of EEG monitoring algorithms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33093360/
33027221,State entropy and burst suppression ratio can show contradictory information: A retrospective study.,European journal of anaesthesiology,2020,"Georgii MT, Pilge S, Schneider G, Kreuzer M","Burst suppression is a characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern that reflects very deep levels of general anaesthesia and may correlate with increased risk of adverse outcomes such as postoperative delirium. EEG-based monitors such as the Entropy Module estimate the level of anaesthesia (state entropy) and provide another index reflecting the occurrence of burst suppression, that is the ratio of burst and suppression (BSR). In the Entropy Module, state entropy and BSR are not interconnected, as they are in the bispectral index (BIS). Hence, state entropy and BSR may provide contradicting information regarding the level of anaesthesia.
We aimed to describe the frequency and characteristics of contradicting state entropy and BSR and to present possible strategies of how to act in these situations.
We based our analyses on state entropy and BSR trend recordings from 2551 patients older than 59 years that showed BSR was > 0 throughout their intervention under general anaesthesia. We determined the maximum state entropy when BSR was > 0, the minimum state entropy with BSR = 0 and the duration of high state entropy with BSR > 0. Further, we selected four exemplar patients to present details of how state entropy and BSR can contradict each other during anaesthesia.
We observed a wide range of state entropy values with BSR > 0. The median [IQR] of the maximum state entropy with BSR > 0 was 53 [45 to 61] and the median of the minimum state entropy without BSR was 21 [15 to 26]. Contradictory BSR and state entropy could persist over several minutes. The presented cases highlight these contradictory BSR and state entropy situations.
Our results illustrate contradictory state entropy and BSR indices that may be relevant for anaesthesia navigation. Longer-lasting episodes may lead to incorrect titration of the depth of the hypnotic component of anaesthesia. Hence, our results demonstrate the necessity to monitor and check the raw EEG or EEG parameters that are less processed than the commercially available indices to safely navigate anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33027221/

In this education article, we describe our approach to TIVA dosing in infants and toddlers (birth to 36 months) which combines the use of pharmacokinetic models with EEG multi-parameter analysis. Pharmacokinetic models describe propofol and remifentanil effect site concentrations (Ce) over time in different age groups for a given dosing regimen. These models display substantial biological variability between individuals within age groups, impeding their application to clinical practice. Nevertheless, they reveal that younger infants require a higher propofol loading dose, a lower propofol maintenance dose, and a higher remifentanil dose compared with older infants. Proprietary EEG indices (eg, Bispectral Index) can serve as a biomarker of propofol Ce in adults and children to guide dosing to the individual patient; however, they are not recommended for infants as their validity remains uncertain this population. In our experience, EEG waveforms and processed parameters can reflect propofol Ce in infants, reflected by spectral edge frequency (SEF), density spectral array (DSA), and waveform patterns. In our practice, we use a ""lookup table"" of age-based dosing regimens or target-controlled infusion (TCI) based on the pharmacokinetic models to deliver a target propofol Ce and co-administer remifentanil and/or regional technique for analgesia. We analyze Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms, SEF, and DSA to adjust the propofol dose or TCI target concentration to the individual infant. EEG analysis mitigates against biological variability inherent in the pharmacokinetic models and has improved our experience with TIVA for infants.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32965066/

However, correlations between LFA and traditional metrics of approach motivation (e.g., scores from the behavioral inhibition system/behavioral approach system [BIS/BAS] survey) are inconsistent. It is also not clear how LFA correlates to approach motivation on an observable, behavioral level. Here, we tested correlations between BIS/BAS scores, LFA, and performance in the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT). In our sample (n = 49), BIS/BAS results did not correlate to LFA values (resting or task states), and were also unrelated to EEfRT performance variables. We found evidence of significant and distinct correlations between LFA and EEfRT performance. Resting-state LFA positively correlated to effort expenditure on lower utility trials, where reward size and/or probability were suboptimal. Task-onset LFA captured in the first 5 min of the task was related to overall behavioral performance in the EEfRT. High task-onset LFA correlated to high trial completion rates, high-effort trial selection percentages, and overall monetary earnings. One interpretation of these initial findings is that resting-state LFA reflects approach tendencies to expend effort, but that this extends to suboptimal situations, whereas task-state LFA better reflects effortful approach toward high-utility goals. Given the relatively small sample size and the risk of Type I/II errors, we present the study as exploratory and the results as preliminary. However, the findings highlight interesting initial links between LFA and EEfRT performance. The need for larger replication studies is discussed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32929696/
32927212,Influence of pre-anesthesia dynamic frontal-parietal communication on individual susceptibility to propofol.,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,2020,"Zhang Y, Wang Y, Yan F, Song D, Wang H, Wang Q, Huang L","We investigated whether pre-anesthesia dynamic frontal-parietal functional connectivity was correlated with the observed interindividual differences in propofol susceptibility.
Three resting-state EEG datasets were used in the study (N = 29, N = 21 and N = 20). We estimated the pre-anesthesia strength and fluctuations of frontal-parietal functional connectivity by using sliding-window analysis. Propofol served as the sole anesthetic drug, and it was administered by using a target-controlled infusion system. Individual susceptibility to propofol was assessed by the induction time, from infusion onset until a bispectral index value of 60 was reached, for subjects in dataset-1 and dataset-2, and susceptibility was assessed by behavioral data for subjects in the external dataset.
We observed in the three datasets that subjects with high susceptibility to propofol had lower pre-anesthesia strength and lower fluctuation of frontal-parietal functional connectivity than the low-susceptibility group at alpha band. Moreover, the induction time was significantly correlated with the estimated pre-anesthesia frontal-parietal functional connectivity measures. We also validated the robustness of these findings by using different window lengths in sliding-window analysis.
Subjects with weaker pre-anesthesia dynamic frontal-parietal communication are more likely to be anesthetized.
These observations suggest that the titration procedure for propofol should consider the pre-anesthesia brain functional state.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32927212/
32925339,"Influence of an ""Electroencephalogram-Based"" Monitor Choice on the Delay Between the Predicted Propofol Effect-Site Concentration and the Measured Drug Effect.",Anesthesia and analgesia,2020,"Sahinovic MM, van den Berg JP, Colin PJ, Gambus PL, Jensen EW, Agustí M, Ferreiro T, Struys MMRF","Clinicians can optimize propofol titration by using 2 sources of pharmacodynamic (PD) information: the predicted effect-site concentration for propofol (Ceprop) and the electroencephalographically (EEG) measured drug effect. Relation between these sources should be time independent, that is, perfectly synchronized. In reality, various issues corrupt time independency, leading to asynchrony or, in other words, hysteresis. This asynchrony can lead to conflicting information, making effective drug dosing challenging. In this study, we tried to quantify and minimize the hysteresis between the Ceprop (calculated using the Schnider model for propofol) and EEG measured drug effect, using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM). Further, we measured the influence of EEG-based monitor choice, namely Bispectral index (BIS) versus qCON index (qCON) monitor, on propofol PD hysteresis.
We analyzed the PD data from 165 patients undergoing propofol-remifentanil anesthesia for outpatient surgery. Drugs were administered using target-controlled infusion (TCI) pumps. Pumps were programmed with Schnider model for propofol and Minto model for remifentanil. We constructed 2 PD models (direct models) relating the Schnider Ceprop to the measured BIS and qCON monitor values. We quantified the models' misspecification due to hysteresis, on an individual level, using the root mean squared errors (RMSEs). Subsequently, we optimized the PD models' predictions by adding a lag term to both models (lag-time PD models) and quantified the optimization using the RMSE.
There is a counterclockwise hysteresis between Ceprop and BIS/qCON values. Not accounting for this hysteresis results in a direct PD model with an effect-site concentration which produces 50% of the maximal drug effect (Ce50) of 6.24 and 8.62 µg/mL and RMSE (median and interquartile range [IQR]) of 9.38 (7.92-11.23) and 8.41(7.04-10.2) for BIS and qCON, respectively. Adding a modeled lag factor of 49 seconds to the BIS model and 53 seconds to the qCON model improved both models' prediction, resulting in similar Ce50 (3.66 and 3.62 µg/mL for BIS and qCON) and lower RMSE (median (IQR) of 7.87 (6.49-9.90) and 6.56 (5.28-8.57) for BIS and qCON.
There is a significant ""Ceprop versus EEG measured drug effect"" hysteresis. Not accounting for it leads to conflicting PD information and false high Ce50 for propofol in both monitors. Adding a lag term improved the PD model performance, improved the ""pump-monitor"" synchrony, and made the estimates of Ce50 for propofol more realistic and less monitor dependent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32925339/
32833715,"Relationship Between Propofol Target Concentrations, Bispectral Index, and Patient Covariates During Anesthesia.",Anesthesia and analgesia,2021,"Schnider TW, Minto CF, Egan TD, Filipovic M","Internationally, propofol is commonly titrated by target-controlled infusion (TCI) to maintain a processed electroencephalographic (EEG) parameter (eg, bispectral index [BIS]) within a specified range. The overall variability in propofol target effect-site concentrations (CeT) necessary to maintain adequate anesthesia in real-world conditions is poorly characterized, as are the patient demographic factors that contribute to this variability. This study explored these issues, hypothesizing that the variability in covariate-adjusted propofol target concentrations during BIS-controlled anesthesia would be substantial and that most of the remaining interpatient variability in drug response would be due to random effects, thus suggesting that the opportunity to improve on the Schnider model with further demographic data is limited.
With ethics committee approval and a waiver of informed consent, a deidentified, high-resolution, intraoperative database consisting of propofol target concentrations, BIS values, and vital signs from 13,239 patients was mined to identify patients who underwent general endotracheal anesthesia using propofol (titrated to BIS), fentanyl, remifentanil, and rocuronium that lasted at least 1 hour. The propofol target concentrations and BIS values 30 minutes after incision (CeT30 and BIS30) were considered representative of stable intraoperative conditions. The data were plotted and analyzed by descriptive statistics. Confidence intervals were computed using a bootstrap method. A linear model was fit to the data to test for correlation with factors of interest (eg, age and weight).
A total of 4584 patients met inclusion criteria and were entered into the analysis. Of the propofol target concentrations, 95% were between 1.5 and 3.5 µg·mL-1. Higher BIS30 values were correlated with higher propofol concentrations. Except for age, all the patient-related variables analyzed entered the regression model linearly. Only 10.2% of the variability in CeT30 was explained by the patient factors of age and weight combined.
Our hypothesis was confirmed. The variability in covariate-adjusted propofol CeT30 titrated to BIS in real-world conditions is considerable, and only a small portion of the remaining variability in drug response is explained by patient demographic factors. This finding may have important implications for the development of new pharmacokinetic (PK) models for propofol TCI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32833715/

In this study, we investigated the association between the real variability of regional cerebral oxygen saturation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and postoperative delayed neurocognitive recovery in patients undergoing heart valve surgery.
A total of 71 patients who underwent cardiac valve surgery were enrolled in this study. Patients were assessed for cognitive function using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MOCA) on the day before surgery and the 7th day after surgery. The real variability of regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2), real variability of the brain bispectral index of EEG (BIS), real variability of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and body temperature were monitored during CPB. Patients were divided into two groups according to neural cognitive function scores to explore the relationship between postoperative delayed neurocognitive recovery and the real variability of cerebral oxygen saturation, BIS, MAP, and body temperature during CPB.
Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed with postoperative delayed neurocognitive recovery. The occurrence of postoperative delayed neurocognitive recovery after surgery was closely related to the large variability of rSO2 during the rewarming phase of CPB (P < .05). Logistic analysis showed that preoperative arrhythmia, a lower level of serum albumin after surgery and greater rSO2 variability during the rewarming phase were risk factors for postoperative delayed neurocognitive recovery (P < .05). In this study, there was no correlation between postoperative delayed neurocognitive recovery and BIS, MAP or body temperature variability (P > .05).

An EEG analog front-end (AFE) that can compensate ±380-mV electrode DC offset using a coarse digital DC servo loop is implemented in the proposed system. The EEG-based MAC, EEGMAC, is introduced as a novel index to accurately predict the DoA, which is designed for applying to patients anesthetized by both volatile and intravenous agents. The proposed deep learning protocol consists of four layers of convolutional neural network and two dense layers. In addition, we optimize the complexity of the deep neural network (DNN) to operate on a microcomputer such as the Raspberry Pi 3, realizing a cost-effective small-size DoA monitoring system. Fabricated in 110-nm CMOS, the prototype AFE consumes 4.33 μW per channel and has the input-referred noise of 0.29 μVrms from 0.5 to 100 Hz with the noise efficiency factor of 2.2. The proposed DNN was evaluated with pre-recorded EEG data from 374 subjects administrated by inhalational anesthetics under surgery, achieving an average squared and absolute errors of 0.048 and 0.05, respectively. The EEGMAC with subjects anesthetized by an intravenous agent also showed a good agreement with the bispectral index value, confirming the proposed DoA index is applicable to both anesthetics. The implemented monitoring system with the Raspberry Pi 3 estimates the EEGMAC within 20 ms, which is about thousand-fold faster than the BIS estimation in literature.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32746339/

One hundred twenty patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery were randomly divided into four groups: group DP, group D, group P and group N. The blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (SPO2), EEG, bispectral index (BIS), Ramsay sedation score and state anxiety questionnaire (SAI) were recorded before administration (T0), 10 min (T1), 20 min (T2) and 30 min (T3) after administration.

The BP, HR, SPO2 were recorded 1 min before intubation (T4), intubation (T5), 3 min (T6) after intubation, 5 min (T7) after intubation, and blood samples were collected from patients before administration and after intubation 2 min to detect serum cortisol (Cor), adrenalin (E) norepinephrine (NE) and blood glucose (BS).
There was no significant difference in Ramsay sedation score before anesthesia, but the Ramsay sedation score in group D、DP was significantly higher than that in group P and group N, the BIS, BP, HR and anxiety scores were significantly lower than those in the group P and group N (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in Ramsay sedation score, BIS value, anxiety score and BP, HR between group D and group DP (p > 0.05).

Three minutes after intubation there was no statistical difference in the changes of Cor, E, NE and BS values compared with before intubation in group P and group DP (p > 0.05), but the changes of Cor, E, NE and BS values were significantly lower than that in group N (p < 0.05). Compared with T0, the values of NE, E, Cor, BS decreased in group D, DP and P at T4, group DP decreased more significantly than group D (p < 0.05). while the NE, E, Cor, BS of T6 are at the same level as the base value. In group N, the NE, E, Cor, BS of T4 were at the same level of T0, but significantly higher at T6.And at T6, NE and E in group D, P and N were significantly different from those in group DP (p < 0.05).
Preoperative intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine combined with parecoxib sodium by functional nasal endoscopy can not only calm and resist anxiety, but also better prevent stress response of endotracheal intubation, which is a safe and effective way of preoperative medication.

Here, we investigate the effects of tACS using an intermittent tACS-EEG protocol and use, in addition to classical metrics, Lempel-Ziv-Welch complexity (LZW) to characterize the interactions between task, endogenous and exogenous oscillations. In a cross-over study, EEG was recorded from thirty participants engaged in a change-of-speed detection task while receiving multichannel tACS over the visual cortex at 10 Hz, 70 Hz and a control condition. In each session, tACS was applied intermittently during 5 s events interleaved with EEG recordings over multiple trials. We found that, with respect to control, stimulation at 10 Hz ([Formula: see text]) enhanced both [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] power, [Formula: see text]-LZW complexity and [Formula: see text] but not [Formula: see text] phase locking value with respect to tACS onset ([Formula: see text]-PLV, [Formula: see text]-PLV), and increased reaction time (RT). [Formula: see text] increased RT with little impact on other metrics. As trials associated with larger [Formula: see text]-power (and lower [Formula: see text]-LZW) predicted shorter RT, we argue that [Formula: see text] produces a disruption of functionally relevant fast oscillations through an increase in [Formula: see text]-band power, slowing behavioural responses and increasing the complexity of gamma oscillations.

This retrospective study investigated the differences in the depth of anesthesia through EEG analysis between propofol- and thiopental-induced anesthesia. We reviewed data of 42 patients undergoing cesarean section who received either thiopental (5 mg/kg) or propofol (2 mg/kg). EEG data were extracted from the bispectral index (BIS) monitor, and 10-second segments were selected from the following sections: 1) Stage I, BIS below 60 after induction; 2) Stage II, after intubation completion; 3) Stage III, end-tidal sevoflurane above 0 vol%. The risk of awareness was represented by the BIS and entropy measures. In Stage III, the thiopental group (n = 20) showed significantly higher BIS value than the propofol group (n = 22) (67.9 [18.66] vs 44.5 [20.63], respectively, p = 0.002). The thiopental group had decreased slow-delta oscillations and increased beta-oscillations as compared to the propofol group in Stages II and III (p < 0.05).

The present study explores the ability of the quasi-stable resting EEG asymmetry information and the associated neurovascular synchronization/desynchronization in bringing more insight into the understanding of neural-mechanisms of affect and approach/withdrawal behavior. For this purpose, a novel frontal alpha-asymmetry based on microstates, that assess quasi-stable EEG scalp topography information, is proposed and compared against standard frontal-asymmetry. Both proposed and standard frontal alpha-asymmetries were estimated from thirty-nine healthy volunteers resting-EEG simultaneously acquired with resting-fMRI. Further, neurovascular mechanisms of these asymmetry measures were estimated through EEG-informed fMRI. Subsequently, the Hemodynamic Lateralization Index (HLI) of the neural-underpinnings of both asymmetry measures was assessed. Finally, the robust correlation of both asymmetry-measures and their HLI's with PANAS, BIS/BAS was carried out. The standard resting frontal-asymmetry and its HLI yielded no significant correlation with any psychological-measures. However, the microstate resting frontal-asymmetry correlated significantly with negative affect and its neural underpinning's HLI significantly correlated with Positive/Negative affect and BIS/BAS measures. Finally, alpha-BOLD desynchronization was observed in neural-underpinning whose HLI correlated significantly with negative affect and BIS.

For evaluation of the time delay, we replayed relevant EEG episodes to the qCON to simulate sudden changes between the states (i) awake/sedation, (ii) adequate anesthesia, or (iii) suppression. We also replayed EEG from 40 patients during LOR and ROR to evaluate the qCON's ability to separate responsiveness from unresponsiveness. The time delays depended on the type of transition. The delays for the important transition between awake/sedation and adequate anesthesia were 21(5) s from awake/sedation to adequate anesthesia and 26(5) s in the other direction. The performance of the qCON to separate responsiveness from unresponsiveness depended on signal quality, the investigation window, i.e. ± 30 s or ± 60 s around LOR/ROR, and the specific transition being tested. AUC was 0.63-0.90 for LOR and 0.61-0.79 for ROR. Time delay and performance during state transitions of the qCON were similar to other monitoring systems such as bispectral index.

Methods: EEG and BIS were sampled from 3 groups: 1. Patients undergoing sedation (n = 26); 2. Awake volunteers (n = 13, positive control for recall) 3. Patients undergoing general anesthesia (GA, n = 12, negative control for recall). In recovery, recall was assessed using the BRICE questionnaire. Of the 26 sedated patients, 12 experienced recall.

During surgery, total intravenous anesthesia was performed with propofol and synthetic opioid sufentanil. The bispectral index was targeted (40 to 60).
The MMN was found in all awake volunteers and validated by an N250 component. In the patient group, the electroencephalogram analysis was not possible in 4 of 11 patients because of anesthesia being too deep, burst suppression, or a high level of noise (>40 μV). Significant N250 response was obtained in 5 of 7 (71.4%) patients under general anesthesia. The 2 other patients also showed MMN which did not reach significance.
To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that phonological processing can be measured during brain surgery under general anesthesia, suggesting that some language processing persists under the condition of unconsciousness. These results encourage further study of language processing under general anesthesia with the goal of making intraoperative neuromonitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31738193/

Delivery of excessive inhalation anesthetics based on minimum alveolar concentration produces greater deep hypnotic times, which may contribute to postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study tested the impact on cognitive function of balanced anesthetic using electroencephalographic (EEG) guidance vs usual anesthesia. We studied 88 surgical patients: 45 randomly assigned to balanced anesthetic technique with EEG guidance and 43 to standard treatment. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery-Mild Cognitive Impairment at 3 intervals (preoperatively, 3-5 days postoperatively, and 3-5 months postoperatively). Additionally, 37 age- and sex-matched individuals not undergoing surgery or anesthesia were evaluated at the same intervals. Better outcomes were seen in the intervention group compared with usual care in the short-term/visual memory cognitive domain (P = .02) at 3 to 5 days, but not at 3 to 5 months. Delivery of anesthesia using EEG monitoring systems can reduce cumulative deep hypnotic time without negatively affecting patient physiologic stress, surgical conditions, or cognitive function. Our findings provide data to support optimal anesthetic approaches to improve cognitive function after anesthesia with volatile anesthetics.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31587724/

The reason causing awareness was unclear. Insufficient anaesthetic dosing was thought as the principal cause. Even awareness was not comprehensively understood, some endeavors have been raised to prevent or reduce it, including i) Reducing the insufficient anaesthetic dosing induced by negligence; ii) Providing close clinical observation and clinical parameters from the monitor such as bispectral index or electroencephalogram, as well as isolated forearm technique and passive brain-computer interface may bring some effects sometimes.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of deepening levels of sedation induced by propofol and how they compare to natural sleep.
Fifty consecutive neurologically normal patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy while sedated with propofol were included. Topographic EEG spectral maps and the bispectral index (BIS) values were obtained at four time points: wakefulness, mild sedation, deep sedation and recovery. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels.
Propofol induced increased delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and gamma (25-40 Hz) power throughout sedation. In addition, there was decreased alpha power (9-11.5 Hz) in the occipital area and increased global beta (12-25 Hz)/gamma (25-40 Hz) power during mild sedation. Deep sedation was associated with increased theta (4-7 Hz)/alpha (9-11.5 Hz)/beta (12-25 Hz) power, which was maximal frontally.
There are distinct changes associated with deepening levels of propofol induced sedation that distinguish it from natural sleep. This suggests that different mechanisms are involved in them and warrants further investigations to clarify the nature of these changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31434471/

The increase in entropy and BIS values is most likely caused by increased EMG activity and a higher level of consciousness. A strong EMG activity can increase entropy and BIS values because it is impossible to separate electroencephalography (EEG) from EMG, and this results from their overlapping power spectra. Thus, the entropy module may be more affected by EMG compared with the BIS module because it has more overlap with the power spectra of EEG and EMG. Several studies have suggested that EMG activity is most likely to increase, especially as it relates to the level of total intravenous anesthesia without a muscle relaxant or an insufficient analgesic level, which results in falsely increased entropy values. We present the case of a patient whose entropy values were falsely elevated by increased EMG activity resulting from light neuromuscular block or nociceptive stimuli during surgery even when undergoing desflurane anesthesia. This was closely related to the change in the neuromuscular block level and it was influenced by the degree of analgesia and the remifentanil infusion rate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31342813/

It has been widely used for monitoring depth of anesthesia (DoA). In this study, we propose a method that combines multiple EEG-based features with artificial neural network (ANN) to assess the DoA. Multiple EEG-based features can express the states of the brain more comprehensively during anesthesia. First, four parameters including permutation entropy, 95% spectral edge frequency, BetaRatio and SynchFastSlow were extracted from the EEG signal. Then, the four parameters were set as the inputs to an ANN which used bispectral index (BIS) as the reference output. 16 patient datasets during propofol anesthesia were used to evaluate this method. The results indicated that the accuracies of detecting each state were 86.4% (awake), 73.6% (light anesthesia), 84.4% (general anesthesia), and 14% (deep anesthesia). The correlation coefficient between BIS and the index of this method was 0.892 ( p < 0.001 ). The results showed that the proposed method could well distinguish between awake and other anesthesia states.

Raw EEG analysis provides direct neurophysiologic measurement of cerebral activity. The relationship between age and EEG has rarely been reported, thus the aim of the present study was to compare raw electroencephalography (EEG) among different age groups of surgical patients under general anesthesia with 1.0 MAC sevoflurane. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 135 patients aged 0-80 years old (ASA physical status I or II) undergoing surgery, who were divided into 6 groups: 1-12 months old (group 1), 1-3 years old (group 2), 3-6 years old (group 3), 6-18 years old (group 4), 18-65 years old (group 5), and 65-80 years old (group 6). Different raw EEG waves (alpha, delta, and theta) were compared for all subjects. RESULTS The BIS values in groups 1 to 6 were 52.2±12.7, 55.0±8.0, 44.5±7.3, 43.8±7.3, 44.2±6.2, and 49.1±6.2 respectively. Compared with groups 1 and 2 (52.2±12.7, 55.0±8.0), BIS values of groups 3, 4, and 5 (44.5±7.3, 43.8±7.3, 44.2±6.2, respectively) were lower (P<0.05). Theta frequency was observed in the 6 groups. The EEG frequencies in groups 1 to 6 were 6.0 (5.5-6.0), 6.0 (5.5-6.0), 6.0 (5.5-6.0), 6.0 (6.0-7.0), 6.3 (6.0-7.0), and 6.0 (5.1-6.0), respectively. Compared with group 6, EEG frequencies in groups 4 and 5 were higher (P<0.05). BIS value was significantly correlated with EEG frequency (R²=0.063, P<0.01).

31124327,Comparative Analysis of Phase Lag Entropy and Bispectral Index as Anesthetic Depth Indicators in Patients Undergoing Thyroid Surgery with Nerve Integrity Monitoring.,Journal of Korean medical science,2019,"Seo KH, Kim KM, Lee SK, John H, Lee J","Most depth of anesthesia (DOA) monitors rely on the temporal characteristics of a single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) and cannot provide spatial or connectivity information. Phase lag entropy (PLE) reflects DOA by calculating diverse connectivity from temporal patterns of phase relationships. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of PLE and bispectral index (BIS) monitors for assessing DOA during anesthesia induction, nerve integrity monitoring (NIM), and anesthesia emergence.
Thirty-five patients undergoing elective thyroid surgery with recurrent laryngeal nerve NIM received propofol and remifentanil via target-controlled infusion. After applying PLE and BIS monitors, propofol infusion was initiated at a calculated effect site concentration (Ce) of 2 μg/mL and then increased in 1-μg/mL Ce increments. After propofol Ce reached 5 μ/mL, a remifentanil infusion was begun, and anesthesia induction was considered complete. During NIM, PLE and BIS values were compared at a specific time points from platysma muscle exposure to subcutaneous tissue closure. PLE and BIS values were recorded continuously from preanesthetic state to full recovery of orientation; bias and limits of agreement between monitors were calculated.
PLE and BIS values decreased progressively with increasing propofol Ce during anesthetic induction and increased by stages during emergence. The prediction probabilities of PLE and BIS for detecting propofol Ce changes were 0.750 and 0.756, respectively, during induction and 0.749 and 0.746, respectively, during emergence. No aberrant PLE or BIS values occurred during NIM. Correlation coefficients for BIS and PLE were 0.98 and 0.92 during induction and emergence, respectively. PLE values were significantly higher than BIS values at full recovery of orientation. Estimated bias between monitors was -4.16 ± 8.7, and 95% limits of agreement were -21.21 to 12.89.
PLE is a reasonable alternative to BIS for evaluating consciousness and DOA during general anesthesia and during NIM.

Neurophysiological variability indicates compromised regulation and organization of neural networks. Based on theories of neuronal integrity changes that accompany aging, we assessed the relative contribution of: 1) premorbid cognitive reserve, 2) current brain integrity (gray and white matter markers of neurodegenerative disease), and 3) current cognition (specifically domains of processing speed/working memory, episodic memory, and motor function) on intraoperative neurophysiological variability as measured from a common intraoperative tool, the Bispectral Index Monitor (BIS).
This sub-study included participants from a parent study of non-demented older adults electing unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) with the same surgeon and anesthesia protocol, who also completed a preoperative neuropsychological assessment and preoperative 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Left frontal two-channel derived EEG via the BIS was acquired preoperatively (un-medicated and awake) and continuously intraoperatively with time from tourniquet up to tourniquet down. Data analyses used correlation and regression modeling.
Fifty-four participants met inclusion criteria for the sub-study. The mean (SD) age was 69.5 (7.4) years, 54% were male, 89% were white, and the mean (SD) American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 2.76 (0.47). We confirmed that brain integrity positively and significantly associated with each of the cognitive domains of interest. EEG intra-individual variability (squared deviation from the mean BIS value between tourniquet up and down) was significantly correlated with cognitive reserve (r = -.40, p = .003), brain integrity (r = -.37, p = .007), and a domain of processing speed/working memory (termed cognitive efficiency; r = -.31, p = .021). Hierarchical regression models that sequentially included age, propofol bolus dose, cognitive reserve, brain integrity, and cognitive efficiency found that intraoperative propofol bolus dose (p = .001), premorbid cognitive reserve (p = .008), and current brain integrity (p = .004) explained a significant portion of intraoperative intra-individual variability from the BIS monitor.
Older adults with higher premorbid reserve and less brain disease were more stable intraoperatively on a depth of anesthesia monitor. Researchers need to replicate findings within larger cohorts and other surgery types.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31120896/

We compared the performance of phase lag entropy with the bispectral index™ in 30 patients scheduled for elective surgery. We initiated a target-controlled infusion of propofol using the Schnider model, and assessed sedation levels using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale every 30 s with each stepwise increase in the effect-site propofol concentration. Phase lag entropy and bispectral index values were recorded. The correlation coefficient and prediction probability between phase lag entropy or bispectral index and the sedation level or effect-site propofol concentration were analysed.

30871507,The oculocardiac reflex and depth of anesthesia measured by brain wave.,BMC anesthesiology,2019,"Arnold RW, Bond AN, McCall M, Lunoe L","The oculocardiac reflex (OCR), bradycardia that occurs during strabismus surgery is a type of trigemino-cardiac reflex (TCR) is blocked by anticholinergics and enhanced by opioids and dexmedetomidine. Two recent studies suggest that deeper inhalational anesthesia monitored by BIS protects against OCR; we wondered if our data correlated similarly.
In an ongoing, prospective study of OCR/TCR elicited by 10-s, 200 g square-wave traction on extraocular muscles (EOM) from 2009 to 2013, anesthetic depth was estimated in cohorts using either BIS or Narcotrend monitors. The depth of anesthesia was deliberately varied between first and second EOM tested.
From 1992 through 2013, 2833 cases of OCR during strabismus surgery were monitored. Excluding re-operations and cases with anticholinergic, OCR from first EOM traction averaged - 20.2 ± 21.8% (S.D.) with a range from - 95 to + 25% in patients aged 0.2 to 90 (median 6.5) years. We did not find correlation between %OCR and brain wave for 97 patients with BIS monitoring and 91 with Narcotrend. With intra-patient controls between first and second muscle, the difference in brain wave did not correlate with difference in %OCR for BIS (r = 0.0002, 95% C. I -0.0002, 0.002, p = 0.30) or for Narcotrend (r = - 0.001, 95% C. I -0.004, 0.001, p = 0.32). Secondary multi-variable analysis demonstrated significant association on %OCR particularly with BIS monitor, opioid, propofol and nitrous oxide concentration in the second EOM tensioned. Sevoflurane concentration correlated better with BIS monitor in second and third EOM tension. %OCR correlated with younger age (p < 0.01). OCR with rapid onset was more profound than those with gradual onset (difference in means 18, 95% C. I 10, 26%).
We were unable to confirm a direct correlation between brain wave monitor and OCR when using multifactorial anesthetic agents. The discrepency with other studies probably reflects direct impact of inhalational agent concentration and less deliberate quantification of EOM tension. We found no level of BIS or Entropy EEG monitoring that uniformly prevents OCR.

Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) is a neurobiological correlate of positive affect. This study investigates, whether receiving an ergogenic placebo increases FAA and whether scores on the behavioral inhibition and activation system (BIS/BAS) scales affect this increase in FAA. Nineteen competitive male cyclists (37.26 ± 9.82 years) performed two maximum effort time trials. The first served as baseline for the second intervention time trial, where athletes received a placebo ergogenic aid or no treatment. We recorded FAA using EEG throughout all time trials and assessed BIS/BAS by questionnaire. There was a significant difference in change from baseline to intervention time trial in FAA during cycling in response to the placebo ergogenic aid compared to the control group. BIS, the BAS subscale Drive and the BAS-BIS difference score significantly co-varied with the change in FAA from baseline to intervention time trial in response to the placebo ergogenic aid. Administering a placebo ergogenic aid significantly influenced FAA during maximum effort cycling. Those athletes with a more pronounced goal seeking persistence and an overall dominance of the BAS over the BIS showed a significantly greater increase in FAA in response to a placebo ergogenic aid.

Sixty patients (age 18-70 years) were recruited. Exclusion criteria included history of epilepsy, neurological or neurosurgical diseases, pre-existing EPs in initial EEG recordings, medication interfering with EEG patterns. Patients were randomly allocated into three different groups: A (sevoflurane, increasing concentrations technique); B (sevoflurane, vital capacity technique); C (intravenous propofol). The clinical and instrumental monitoring included arterial blood pressure, heart rate, standard electrocardiography II, arterial oxygen saturation, facial electromyography, fraction of inspired sevoflurane, fraction of expired sevoflurane, minimal alveolar concentration of sevoflurane, and BIS.
Neurophysiological analysis of EEGs showed different EPs: polyspikes (PS), rhythmic polyspikes (PSR), and periodic epileptiform discharges (PED).

These monitors use ratios of high to low frequency power which assumes that each neurological process contributes a unique frequency pattern. However, recent research of the effect of deep brain stimulation on EEG beta oscillations suggests that wave shape, a non-sinusoidal feature that is only measurable in the time-domain, can change the frequency 'signature' of a neurological rhythmical process by the inclusion or removal of harmonic frequencies. If wave shape variations are present in the EEG of anaesthetised patients, then quantitative EEG monitors likely overestimate the anaesthetic drug effect. The purpose of this paper is to investigate alpha-wave shape in the EEG of anaesthetised patients and demonstrate the effect of wave shape on the frequency ratios that are commonly utilised in the BIS quantitative EEG monitor. EEG data, demographic information, and surgery details were collected prospectively from 305 patients undergoing a general anaesthetic for elective surgery. Alpha-wave shape was categorised by triangularity of the EEG extrema, a measure of how peaked (towards a sawtooth wave) or flat (towards a square wave) the extremum was. The alpha-wave was then artificially modified to either a sawtooth wave or square wave, and BetaRatio and PowerFastSlow metrics calculated. Age was found to be the only significant predictor of alpha wave triangularity. The artificially modified square-alpha waves increased the power in the frequency spectrum at 26 Hz by 1-5 dB, and increased the BetaRatio by 0.7. The alpha-wave of anaesthetised patients contains non-sinusoidal components which likely impact depth of anaesthesia calculations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30671894/

Conversely, EMG seems necessary to constitute the high BIS indicative of an awake condition, and may play a fundamental role in calculating BIS, rather than distorting the appropriate BIS. However, exactly how EMG is associated with a high BIS remains unclear. We intended to clarify the respective contributions of EMG and various electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters to high BIS. In 79 courses of anaesthesia, BIS monitor-derived EMG parameters (EMGLOW), and other processed EEG parameters [SEF95 (spectral edge frequency 95%), SynchFastSlow (bispectral parameter), BetaRatio (frequency parameter), total power subtypes in five frequency range], were obtained simultaneously with BIS, every 3 s. These EEG parameters were used for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of detecting three BIS levels (BIS > 80, BIS > 70, and BIS > 60) to assess their diagnosabilities. A total of 218,418 data points derived from 79 cases were used for analysis. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated and optimal cut-off (threshold) was determined by Youden index. As the results, for detecting BIS > 80, the AUC of EMGLOW was 0.975 [0.974-0.977] (mean [95% confidence interval]), significantly higher than any other processed EEG parameters such as BetaRatio (0.832 [0.828-0.835]), SEF95 (0.821 [0.817-0.826]) and SynchFastSlow (0.769 [0.764-0.774]) (p < 0.05 each). The threshold of EMGLOW for detecting BIS > 80 was 35.7 dB, with high sensitivity (92.5%) and high specificity (96.5%).

The aim was not to show that the N2 is linked to trait BAS instead of trait BIS, but that a motivating setting may alter its association with those traits. Furthermore, we aimed at replicating results indicating that the association between reasoning ability and the N2 depends on the matching of the content of the reasoning tasks and the go-nogo task. The electroencephalogram (64 electrodes, P9/P10 offline reference, Biosemi) was recorded in a sample of 117 healthy participants (60 females; age: M = 24.79, SD = 3.98), who performed a numerical learning task. At the beginning of each trial, participants heard motivating or neutral words. Participants completed Carver and White's BIS/BAS scales (1994) and the Intelligence-Structure-Test 2000R (Liepmann et al., 2007). The N2 was identified by a temporospatial principal component analysis. Structural equation models revealed that higher trait BAS scores were associated with larger N2s especially when hearing motivating words. Solely higher numerical reasoning scores were associated with larger N2s in the neutral condition. Moreover, the interaction of trait BAS with verbal reasoning ability predicted an increased negativity of the N2 with time-on-task in the motivating condition, suggesting that motivating words yielded an increase of conflict monitoring with time-on-task for participants with higher verbal reasoning ability and higher trait BAS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30590087/

Among a sample of 53 adolescents with ASD, this study examined associations between (a) self-reported BIS/BAS and frontal and parietal alpha electroencephalogram asymmetry and whether these indices related to (b) ASD severity (via the Autism Quotient), and/or (c) co-occurring anxiety and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (via Youth Self Report and Child Behavior Checklist). Findings showed that alpha asymmetry was associated with self-reported BAS scores, such that greater BAS was related to greater right-frontal hemisphere activation and relatively greater left-parietal hemisphere activation. Additionally, associations emerged between ASD severity and self-reported BAS and alpha asymmetry, and between anxiety symptoms and self-reported BIS and alpha asymmetry. Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed that BAS mediated the association between asymmetry and autism severity. Therefore, alpha asymmetry and BIS/BAS activity may provide insight into how ASD presents in adolescence as well as who might be at greater risk for developing co-occurring psychopathologies. This study highlights the importance of considering motivational systems to elucidate individual differences among youth with ASD and working toward the longer term goal of better understanding differential responses to treatment.

The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of POCD in patients administered either sevoflurane or propofol for maintenance of anaesthesia during total hip replacement surgery. Following administration of a spinal anaesthetic, patients received either sevoflurane (n=121) or propofol (n=171) at the discretion of the anaesthetist for maintenance of general anaesthesia to maintain the processed electroencephalogram (bispectral index, BIS) under 60. POCD was assessed postoperatively at day 7, three months, and 12 months using a neurocognitive test battery. There was no statistically significant difference between the incidence of POCD at any timepoint with sevoflurane compared to propofol.

Avoiding conditions of over- and under-sedation is a challenge in a neonatal intensive care setting. Drug administration could be optimized by the concomitant use of objective methods to assess the level of sedation.
We aimed to look at the ability of different methods (Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale, amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram, and Bispectral Index), and their combination, in detecting different level of sedation.
Twenty-seven neonates among whom 17 were receiving sedatives with or without opiate analgesics were monitored using the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale, the amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram, and the Bispectral Index. According to the expert opinion of two trained neonatologists, patients were categorized into three groups: no, light, and deep sedation. Four hours of simultaneous assessment of the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale scores, Burdjalov scores (to summarize the amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram trace), and Bispectral Index values were considered for the comparative analysis across these groups.
All three methods could differentiate patients who were not sedated from those who were deeply sedated: median score 12 and 9, respectively, (95% CI of difference = 1.99-5.99, P = 0.001) for the amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram Burdjalov score; median 1 and -5, respectively, (95% CI of difference = 2.99-8.00, P = 0.001) for the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale; and median 48 and 37, respectively, (CI of difference = 1.77-22.00, P = 0.043) for the Bispectral Index. However none of them, used alone, was able to differentiate light and deep sedation: median score 10 and 9, respectively, for the amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram Burdjalov score; median -2 and -5, respectively, for the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale; and median 48 and 37, respectively, for the Bispectral Index. Only the amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram and the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale were able to differentiate between the conditions of no sedation and light sedation. Also, according to the area under the curves values, the combination of the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale with the Burdjalov score derived from the amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram showed the best accuracy in differentiating light and deep sedation.
While none of the three methods alone was able to precisely differentiate between different levels of sedation, we suggest that using a combination of amplitude-integrated Electroencephalogram and Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale can be useful to distinguish between light and deep sedation in neonatal patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30375123/

With increased focus on detecting the anesthesia states of patients in the course of surgery, more attention has been paid to analyzing the power spectra and entropy measures of EEG signal during anesthesia. In this paper, by using the relative power of EEG frequency bands and the EEG entropy measures, a new method for detecting the depth of anesthesia states has been presented based on the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers. EEG signals were recorded from 20 patients before, during and after general anesthesia in the operating room at a sampling rate of 200 Hz. Then, 12 features were extracted from each EEG segment, 10 s in length, which are used for anesthesia state monitoring. No significant difference was observed (p > 0.05) between these features and the bispectral index (BIS), which is the commonly used measure of anesthetic effect. The used LS-SVM classifier based method is able to identify the anesthesia states with an accuracy of 80% with reference to the BIS index. Since the underlying equation of the utilized LS-SVM is linear, the computational time of the algorithm is not significant and therefore it can be used for online application in operation rooms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30338496/

Fifteen men aged >60 years (mean, 70 years) were selected. Propofol target-controlled infusion was performed under EEG bispectral index monitoring. The propofol target effect-site concentration, blood pressure, heart rate, and distributions and powers of the EEG spectrum were recorded in an awake state and under anesthesia. The EEG included seven bands: delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (4.0-7.0 Hz), alpha-1 (7.5-9.5 Hz), alpha-2 (10-12 Hz), beta-1 (13-23 Hz), beta-2 (24-34 Hz), and gamma (35-45 Hz).
From an awake state to anesthesia, the brain topographic map showed that the energies of delta, theta, alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta-1 were concentrated in the frontoparietal site, and the power increased significantly. The energy distribution of beta-2 was significantly decreased and the power significantly reduced. The energy distribution of gamma in the temporal lobe was also markedly decreased and the power significantly reduced.
This study revealed the changes in the spatial distribution and regional energy of the EEG DMD in men of advanced age from the awake state to the anesthetized state.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30246583/

Off-label use of Bispectral Index within context and limitations for conditions other than depth of anesthesia.,Minerva anestesiologica,2019,Dahaba AA,"Numerous articles appeared in literature using brain function monitors (BFM), such as Bispectral Index (BIS) to assess cerebral cognitive conditions not related to depth of anesthesia. BIS cannot be considered a ""true"" reflection of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal nor an independent measure of brain function. BIS algorithm was retrospectively derived from EEG changes with incremental doses of γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)ergic anesthetic agents while measuring 3 descriptors. In many instances we are confronted with BIS values that do not concur with clinically judged anesthetic state arising from an underlying alteration of the patients' own EEG. Because BIS is an EEG derived parameter; conditions that can ""alter"" the raw EEG signal would subsequently change BIS to reflect other unrelated EEG events of patient-dependent pathophysiologic perturbations. Could we use BIS monitor outside the scope of the operating room to ""grade"" other EEG conditions? Actually the answer to that seems to be a ""very cautious"" yes. Because BIS is a rather appealing scale from 100 to 0, it is tempting to find numerical cut-off values for conditions that are already clinically graded like West Haven hepatic encephalopathy. Having said that I strongly argue against going as far as using BIS in Critical Care Unit (CCU) setting, there are too much heterogeneity and many disease states in the CCU patients, other than sedatives /hypnotics, that would strongly influence BIS values, in effect rendering BIS not only useless most of the time but can also be misleading.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30226034/

This retrospective study now investigated whether BIS EEG tracings can predict neurological outcome after cardiac arrest (CA).
Bilateral BIS monitoring (BIS VISTA™, Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. Norwood, USA) was started following intensive care unit admission. Six, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 h after targeted temperature management (TTM) at 33 °C was started, BIS EEG tracings were extracted and reviewed by two neurophysiologists for the presence of slow diffuse rhythm, burst suppression, cerebral inactivity and epileptic activity (defined as continuous, monomorphic, > 2 Hz generalized sharp activity or continuous, monomorphic, < 2 Hz generalized blunt activity). At 180 days post-CA, neurological outcome was determined using cerebral performance category (CPC) classification (CPC1-2: good and CPC3-5: poor neurological outcome).
Sixty-three out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were enrolled for data analysis of whom 32 had a good and 31 a poor neurological outcome. Epileptic activity within 6-12 h predicted CPC3-5 with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%. Epileptic activity within time frames 18-24 and 36-48 h showed a PPV for CPC3-5 of 90 and 93%, respectively. Cerebral inactivity within 6-12 h predicted CPC3-5 with a PPV of 57%. In contrast, cerebral inactivity between 36 and 48 h predicted CPC3-5 with a PPV of 100%. The pattern with the worst predictive power at any time point was burst suppression with PPV of 44, 57 and 40% at 6-12 h, at 18-24 h and at 36-48 h, respectively. Slow diffuse rhythms at 6-12 h, at 18-24 h and at 36-48 h predicted CPC1-2 with PPV of 74, 76 and 80%, respectively.
Based on simplified BIS EEG, the presence of epileptic activity at any time and cerebral inactivity after the end of TTM may assist poor outcome prognostication in successfully resuscitated CA patients. A slow diffuse rhythm at any time after CA was indicative for a good neurological outcome.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30112686/

In the current study, to isolate the brain mechanisms involved in synchronizing finger tapping with a musical beat, we compared SMS to pure self-paced finger tapping and listen-only conditions at different tempi. We analyzed EEG data using frequency domain steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) to identify sustained electrophysiological brain activity during repetitive tasks. Behavioral results revealed different timing modes between SMS and self-paced finger tapping, associated with distinct scalp topographies, thus suggesting different underlying brain sources. After subtraction of the listen-only brain activity, SMS was compared to self-paced finger tapping. Resulting source estimations showed stronger activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus during SMS, and stronger activation of the bilateral inferior parietal lobule during self-paced finger tapping. These results point to the left inferior frontal gyrus as a pivot for perception-action coupling. We discuss our findings in the context of the ongoing debate about SSEPs interpretation given the variety of brain events contributing to SSEPs and similar EEG frequency responses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30098488/

However, the distinct EEG dynamic characteristics at comparable sedation levels have not been well studied, resulting in potential interpretation errors in EEG monitoring during sedation. We aimed to analyze the EEG dynamics of dexmedetomidine and propofol at comparable sedation levels and to explore EEG changes with increased sedation levels for each agent. We measured the Bispectral Index (BIS) and 20-channel EEG under dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation from wakefulness, moderate sedation, and deep sedation to recovery in healthy volunteers (n = 10) in a randomized, 2-day, crossover study. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels. Despite similar changes in increased delta oscillations, multiple differences in the EEG spatiotemporal dynamics were observed between these two agents. During moderate sedation, both dexmedetomidine and propofol induced increased spindle power; however, dexmedetomidine decreased the global alpha/beta/gamma power, whereas propofol decreased the alpha power in the occipital area and increased the global spindle/beta/gamma power. During deep sedation, dexmedetomidine was associated with increased fronto-central spindle power and decreased global alpha/beta/gamma power, but propofol was associated with increased theta/alpha/spindle/beta power, which was maximized in the frontal area. The transition of topographic alpha/spindle/beta power distribution from moderate sedation to deep sedation completely differed between these two agents. Our study demonstrated that there was a distinct hierarchy of EEG changes with increased sedation depths by propofol and dexmedetomidine. Differences in EEG dynamics at the same sedation level might account for differences in the BIS value and reflect the different sedation mechanisms.

Furthermore, patients with postoperative delirium might also be at risk of developing long-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction. One potentially modifiable variable is use of intraoperative processed electroencephalogram to guide anesthesia. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the relationship between processed electroencephalogram monitoring and postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction.
A systematic search for randomized controlled trials was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google search using the keywords processed electroencephalogram, Bispectral Index, postoperative delirium, postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Screening and data extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers, and risk of bias was assessed. Postoperative delirium combined-effect estimates calculated with a fixed-effects model were expressed as odds ratios with 95% CIs.
Thirteen of 369 search results met inclusion criteria. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction data were excluded in meta-analysis because of heterogeneity of outcome measurements; results were discussed descriptively. Five studies were included in the quantitative postoperative delirium analysis, with data pooled from 2,654 patients. The risk of bias was low in three studies and unclear for the other two. The use of processed electroencephalogram-guided anesthesia was associated with a 38% reduction in odds for developing postoperative delirium (odds ratio = 0.62; P < 0.001; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.76).
Processed electroencephalogram-guided anesthesia was associated with a decrease in postoperative delirium. The mechanism explaining this association, however, is yet to be determined.

Unlike clinical signs, electroencephalon-based cerebral monitoring allows to detect and quantify an overdose of hypnotics. Therefore, we tested whether the use of an electroencephalon-based cerebral monitoring will cause less hypotension following induction with propofol.
Subjects were randomly assigned to a bispectral index (BIS)-guided (target range 40-60) or to a weight-related (2 mg.kg
Of the 240 patients enrolled into this study, 235 predominantly non-geriatric (median 48 years, 25th - 75th percentile 35-61 years) patients without severe concomitant disease (88% American Society of Anesthesiology physical status 1-2) undergoing ear, nose and throat surgery, ophthalmic surgery, and dermatologic surgery were analyzed. Patients who were manually administered propofol guided by BIS (n = 120) compared to those who were given propofol by weight (n = 115) did not differ concerning the incidence of hypotension (44% vs. 45%; p = 0.87). Study groups were also similar regarding the maximal drop in MAP compared to baseline (33% vs. 30%) and the proportion of hypotensive events related to all measurements (17% vs. 19%). Final propofol induction doses in BIS group and NON-BIS group were similar (1.93 mg/kg vs. 2 mg/kg). There was no linear correlation between BIS and the drop in MAP at all times (r < 0.2 for all) except for a weak one at 6 min (r = 0.221).
Results of our study suggest that a BIS-guided compared to a weight-adjusted manual administration of propofol for induction of general anesthesia in non-geriatric patients will not lower the incidence and degree of arterial hypotension.

This review discusses new advancements in ECT with regards to anesthetic variables, stimulus, and response variables along with their impact on clinical outcomes.
Anesthetic variables influence clinical efficacy and patient tolerance of ECT. Although etomidate or a ketamine-propofol combination may be the first choice for many clinicians, the search for ideal induction agent continues. Dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, or ketamine may aid in augmentation of ECT; however, they are not recommended routinely. A systematic procedure for hyperventilation of the patient has been shown to have clinical repercussions. Optimizing anesthesia-ECT time interval (ASTI) has a significant impact on the success of the procedure. BIS monitoring alone cannot be relied upon for timing stimulus. High-dose brief pulse right unilateral ECT represents an acceptable first-line form of treatment, though there is currently no 'gold standard'. Other stimulus variations such as focal electrically administered seizure therapy, individualized low-amplitude seizure therapy, magnetic seizure therapy, left unilateral and left anterior right temporal electrode placements are explored to reduce memory effects. EEG ictal indices may be relied upon for seizure adequacy, and therefore may be used to both guide treatment and predict the outcome of the procedure.
Modern ECT is streamlined by augmentation with drugs, hyperventilation, optimizing anesthesia-ECT time interval, and various stimulus parameters guided by seizure adequacy markers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29870425/

To assess whether the use of processed EEG or auditory evoked potential (AEP) indices (bispectral index (BIS), narcotrend index, cerebral state index, state entropy and response entropy, patient state index, index of consciousness, A-line autoregressive index, and auditory evoked potentials (AEP index)) as guides to anaesthetic delivery can reduce the risk of POD and POCD in non-cardiac surgical or non-neurosurgical adult patients undergoing general anaesthesia compared with standard practice where only clinical signs are used.

Secondary outcomes included: all-cause mortality; any postoperative complications; and postoperative length of stay. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.

There are five ongoing studies and one study awaiting classification.Anaesthesia administration guided by the indices from a processed EEG (bispectral index) probably reduces the risk of POD within seven days after surgery with risk ratio (RR) of 0.71 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 17, 95% CI 11 to 34; 2197 participants; 3 RCTs; moderate quality of evidence). Three trials also showed the lower rate of POCD at 12 weeks after surgery (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.96; NNTB 38, 95% CI 21 to 289; 2051 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but it is uncertain whether processed EEG indices reduce POCD at one week (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02; 3 trials; 1989 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and at 52 weeks (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.80; 1 trial; 59 participants; very low quality of evidence). There may be little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.64; 1 trial; 1155 participants; low-quality evidence). One trial suggested a lower risk of any postoperative complications with processed EEG (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; 902 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no effect on reduced postoperative length of stay (mean difference -0.2 days, 95% CI -2.02 to 1.62; 1155 participants; low-quality evidence).
There is moderate-quality evidence that optimized anaesthesia guided by processed EEG indices could reduce the risk of postoperative delirium in patients aged 60 years or over undergoing non-cardiac surgical and non-neurosurgical procedures. We found moderate-quality evidence that postoperative cognitive dysfunction at three months could be reduced in these patients. The effect on POCD at one week and over one year after surgery is uncertain. There are no data available for patients under 60 years. Further blinded randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate strategies for the amelioration of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and their consequences such as dementia (including Alzheimer's disease (AD)) in both non-elderly (below 60 years) and elderly (60 years or over) adult patients. The one study awaiting classification and five ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29761891/
29746721,Melatonin for the promotion of sleep in adults in the intensive care unit.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2018,"Lewis SR, Pritchard MW, Schofield-Robinson OJ, Alderson P, Smith AF","Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) experience sleep deprivation caused by environmental disruption, such as high noise levels and 24-hour lighting, as well as increased patient care activities and invasive monitoring as part of their care. Sleep deprivation affects physical and psychological health, and patients perceive the quality of their sleep to be poor whilst in the ICU. Artificial lighting during night-time hours in the ICU may contribute to reduced production of melatonin in critically ill patients. Melatonin is known to have a direct effect on the circadian rhythm, and it appears to reset a natural rhythm, thus promoting sleep.
To assess whether the quantity and quality of sleep may be improved by administration of melatonin to adults in the intensive care unit. To assess whether melatonin given for sleep promotion improves both physical and psychological patient outcomes.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2017), Embase (1974 to September 2017), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to September 2017), and PsycINFO (1806 to September 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.
We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials with adult participants (over the age of 16) admitted to the ICU with any diagnoses given melatonin versus a comparator to promote overnight sleep. We included participants who were mechanically ventilated and those who were not mechanically ventilated. We planned to include studies that compared the use of melatonin, given at an appropriate clinical dose with the intention of promoting night-time sleep, against no agent; or against another agent administered specifically to promote sleep.
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.
We included four studies with 151 randomized participants. Two studies included participants who were mechanically ventilated, one study included a mix of ventilated and non-ventilated participants and in one study participants were being weaned from mechanical ventilation. Three studies reported admission diagnoses, which varied: these included sepsis, pneumonia and cardiac or cardiorespiratory arrest. All studies compared melatonin against no agent; three were placebo-controlled trials; and one compared melatonin with usual care. All studies administered melatonin in the evening.All studies reported adequate methods for randomization and placebo-controlled trials were blinded at the participant and personnel level. We noted high risk of attrition bias in one study and were unclear about potential bias introduced in two studies with differences between participants at baseline.It was not appropriate to combine data owing to differences in measurement tools, or methods used to report data.The effects of melatonin on subjectively rated quantity and quality of sleep are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Three studies (139 participants) reported quantity and quality of sleep as measured through reports of participants or family members or by personnel assessments. Study authors in one study reported no difference in sleep efficiency index scores between groups for participant assessment (using Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire) and nurse assessment. Two studies reported no difference in duration of sleep observed by nurses.The effects of melatonin on objectively measured quantity and quality of sleep are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (37 participants) reported quantity and quality of sleep as measured by polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, bispectral index (BIS) or electroencephalogram (EEG). Study authors in one study reported no difference in sleep efficiency index scores between groups using BIS and actigraphy. These authors also reported longer sleep in participants given melatonin which was not statistically significant, and improved sleep (described as ""better sleep"") in participants given melatonin from analysis of area under the curve (AUC) of BIS data. One study used PSG but authors were unable to report data because of a large loss of participant data.One study (82 participants) reported no evidence of a difference in anxiety scores (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (94 participants) reported data for mortality: one study reported that overall one-third of participants died; and one study reported no evidence of difference between groups in hospital mortality (very low certainty). One study (82 participants) reported no evidence of a difference in length of ICU stay (very low certainty evidence). Effects of melatonin on adverse events were reported in two studies (107 participants), and are uncertain (very low certainty evidence): one study reported headache in one participant given melatonin, and one study reported excessive sleepiness in one participant given melatonin and two events in the control group (skin reaction in one participant, and excessive sleepiness in another participant).The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was limited by sparse data with few participants. We noted study limitations in some studies due to high attrition and differences between groups in baseline data; and doses of melatonin varied between studies. Methods used to measure data were not consistent for outcomes, and use of some measurement tools may not be effective for use on the ICU patient. All studies included participants in the ICU but we noted differences in ICU protocols, and one included study used a non-standard sedation protocol with participants which introduced indirectness to the evidence.
We found insufficient evidence to determine whether administration of melatonin would improve the quality and quantity of sleep in ICU patients. We identified sparse data, and noted differences in study methodology, in ICU sedation protocols, and in methods used to measure and report sleep. We identified five ongoing studies from database and clinical trial register searches. Inclusion of data from these studies in future review updates would provide more certainty for the review outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29746721/
29678142,Abnormally low Bispectral index and severe hypoglycemia during maintenance of and recovery from general anesthesia in diabetic retinopathy surgery: two case reports.,BMC anesthesiology,2018,"Xi C, Pan C, Li T","Hypoglycemia is one of the most fatal complications during the perioperative period. General anesthesia or sedation can mask a hypoglycemia-altered mental status. Acute hypoglycemia might result in permanent brain injury. There is no way to detect hypoglycemia during general anesthesia, except for intermittent blood glucose monitoring.
Hypoglycemia is associated with changes in electroencephalogram readings. Here, we report two cases of patients with an abnormally low Bispectral Index (BIS) associated with diabetic retinopathy surgery, one in the recovery stage of general anesthesia and the other in the maintenance of general anesthesia. Hemodynamics were stable. Severe hypoglycemia (1.6 mmol/L and 2.2 mmol/L) was then detected. BIS increased with the correction of severe hypoglycemia.
For diabetic patients, when the intraoperative BIS value is abnormally low, hypoglycemia should be considered. Severe hypoglycemia may be presented in BIS monitoring during general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29678142/
29605758,Electrophysiological activity is associated with vulnerability of Internet addiction in non-clinical population.,Addictive behaviors,2018,"Wang GY, Griskova-Bulanova I","This study investigated the electrophysiological activity associated with vulnerability of problematic Internet use in non-clinical population. The resting EEG spectrum of alpha (8-13 Hz) rhythm was measured in 22 healthy subjects who have used the Internet for recreational purpose. The vulnerability of Internet addiction was assessed using Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and Assessment for Computer and Internet Addiction-Screener (AICA-S) respectively. Depression and impulsivity were also measured with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11(BIS-11) respectively. The IAT was positively correlated with alpha power obtained during eyes closed (EC, r = 0.50, p = 0.02) but not during eyes open (EO). This was further supported by a negative correlation (r = -0.48, p = 0.02) between IAT scores and alpha desynchronization (EO-EC). These relationships remained significant following correction for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, The BDI score showed positive correlation with alpha asymmetry at mid-lateral (r = 0.54, p = 0.01) and mid-frontal (r = 0.46, p = 0.03) regions during EC, and at mid-frontal (r = 0.53, p = 0.01) region during EO. The current findings suggest that there are associations between neural activity and the vulnerability of problematic Internet use. Understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying problematic Internet use would contribute to improved early intervention and treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29605758/

The aim of the present study is to investigate the differences in decision-making in PD patients with or without PG considering both neurophysiological and behavioral aspects. The IOWA Gambling Task (IGT) and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were considered to elucidate the decision and post-feedback processes in PG. The sample included fifty-two PD patients, divided in three groups: 17 PD patients with active gambling behavior (PD Gamblers, PDG); 15 PD patients who remitted from PG (PD Non-Gamblers, PDNG); and a Control Group (CG) composed by 20 patients with PD only. EEG and IGT performance were recorded during decision and post-feedback phase. Results showed worse performance and an increase of the low frequency bands in the frontal area for the PDG group compared to the other two groups. In addition, higher BAS (Behavioral Activation System) and BIS-11 (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) personality components were correlated to groups' behavioral response. These results show an anomalous behavioral (IGT) and cortical response of PDG patients related to their inability to use adequate control mechanisms during a decision-making task where reward mechanisms (BAS) and impulsivity (BIS-11) are relevant.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29580652/

Maintaining the bispectral index (BIS) or state entropy (SE) between 40 and 60 has been recommended to mitigate anesthesia awareness. Nonetheless, SEs > 70 were frequently observed at end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations unlikely to allow awareness. We sought to determine the prevalence of elevated discordant measurements during BIS and SE monitoring.
Electronic data collected over 11 months at two academic hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. At the hospital using SE, all cases were included with patients ≥ 18 yr and sevoflurane administered for at least 30 min during surgery. A cohort of cases propensity matched by age and American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status were selected from the hospital using BIS. Elevated discordant EEG indices were defined as values > 70 occurring during stable end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations > 1.5%. The odds ratio (OR) based on the probability of a case having at least one elevated discordant SE or BIS lasting ≥ two minutes (primary endpoint) was calculated.
At each hospital, 3,690 cases were studied. The mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) incidence of cases with at least one interval of an elevated discordant EEG index lasting at least two minutes was 3.6% (2.8% to 4.4%) for SE compared with 0.24% (0.17% to 0.27%) for BIS (pooled OR, 17.0; 95% CI, 8.3 to 34.7; P < 0.001).
The prevalence of an elevated discordant EEG index is much greater with SE than with BIS. Elevated index values occurring at anesthetic concentrations well above the awareness threshold need to be assessed to determine if they indicate an inadequate depth of anesthesia requiring treatment or if they simply reflect the underlying monitoring algorithm.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29524200/
29505849,Resting beta activation and trait motivation: Neurophysiological markers of motivated motor-action preparation.,International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology,2018,"Threadgill AH, Gable PA","Based on Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (Gray and McNaughton 2000), human behavior is influenced by systems of approach motivation, avoidance motivation, and a third regulatory system presiding over the other two. These systems mediate action and are likely related to neurophysiological markers of motor-action preparation. Previous research has found that lower levels of beta activity over the motor cortex are associated with greater motor-action preparation. The current study sought to test whether trait approach, avoidance, and regulatory control would relate to resting beta activity over the motor cortex, a measure of motor-action preparation. One hundred twenty-eight individuals completed measures of trait behavioral approach motivation and trait behavioral avoidance motivation (BIS/BAS; Carver and White 1994), as well as regulatory control (UPPS-P Impulsive Behaviour Scale; Whiteside et al. 2005). Then, resting EEG was recorded. Greater trait approach was negatively associated with resting beta activity. In contrast, greater trait impulsivity was associated with greater resting beta activity. Lower levels of resting beta activity in the motor cortex appear to be associated with traits related to deliberate motivated motor behaviors. Trait motor-action preparation seems to be an indicator of tendencies toward planful motivated behavior.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29505849/

This study was carried out in order to evaluate different methods of assessment of depth of sedation: bispectral index (BiS), modified Richmond Agitation/Sedation Scale (mRASS), modified Ramsay Sedation Scale (mRSS) and modified Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (mOAAS) and their applicability to clinical practice.
Two hundred patients were recruited. Sedation was given by standard clinical practice using propofol sedation or patient controlled sedation. Sedation was assessed on all patients using the above-mentioned methods. BiS was considered the reference point for sedation scales. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to determine the consistency of different scales in respect to each other and prediction probability and Spearman's correlation coefficients of sedation scales were calculated to show the relationship between sedation scales and BiS.
All scales showed high reliability with overall Cronbach's alpha 0.943. Dropping scales suggested better consistency between mOAAS, mRSS and mRASS than with BiS. Spearman's correlation and prediction probability showed similar results with all tested scales: mOAAS (0.695, 0.739), mRSS (0.673, 0.735), mRASS (0.683, 0.738), p < .01 for all scales.
All tested methods were found to be reliable in the assessment of the depth of sedation when compared with each other. However, mRASS, mRSS and mOAAS require the patient to respond to verbal or tactile stimulus, which may impair execution of ERCP, whereas BiS information is collected directly from electroencephalogram and thus may be preferable in clinical setting.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29411681/

Successfully resuscitated CA patients were transferred to the Catherization Lab followed by percutaneous coronary intervention when indicated. On arrival at the coronary care unit, bilateral BIS monitoring was started and continued up to 72 h. Raw simplified EEG tracings were extracted from the BIS monitor at a time point coinciding with the registration of standard EEG monitoring. BIS EEG tracings were reviewed by two neurophysiologists, who were asked to indicate the presence of following patterns: diffuse slowing rhythm, burst suppression pattern, cerebral inactivity, periodic epileptiform discharges and status epilepticus (SE). Additionally, these simplified BIS EEG tracings were analysed by two inexperienced investigators, who were asked to indicate the presence of SE only.
Thirty-two simplified BIS EEG samples were analysed. Compared to standard EEG, neurophysiologists interpreted all simplified EEG samples with a sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 100% and an interobserver variability of 0.843. Furthermore, SE was identified with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 94% by two unexperienced physicians.
Using a simple classification system, raw simplified EEG derived from a BIS monitoring device is comparable to standard EEG monitoring. Moreover, investigators without EEG experience were capable to identify SE in post-CA patients. Future studies will be warranted to confirm our results and to determine the added value of using simplified BIS EEG in terms of prognostic and therapeutic implications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29409776/

The present study is targeted to estimate the depth of anaesthesia using cognitive signal processing and intelligent modeling techniques. The neurophysiological signal that reflects cognitive state of anaesthetic drugs is the electroencephalogram signal. The information available on electroencephalogram signals during anaesthesia are drawn by extracting relative wave energy features from the anaesthetic electroencephalogram signals. Discrete wavelet transform is used to decomposes the electroencephalogram signals into four levels and then relative wave energy is computed from approximate and detail coefficients of sub-band signals. Relative wave energy is extracted to find out the degree of importance of different electroencephalogram frequency bands associated with different anaesthetic phases awake, induction, maintenance and recovery. The Kruskal-Wallis statistical test is applied on the relative wave energy features to check the discriminating capability of relative wave energy features as awake, light anaesthesia, moderate anaesthesia and deep anaesthesia. A novel depth of anaesthesia index is generated by implementing a Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system based fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm which uses relative wave energy features as inputs. Finally, the generated depth of anaesthesia index is compared with a commercially available depth of anaesthesia monitor Bispectral index.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29376882/
29337234,Electrophysiological Activity Prior to Self-initiated Movements is Related to Impulsive Personality Traits.,Neuroscience,2018,"Rossi A, Giovannelli F, Gavazzi G, Righi S, Cincotta M, Viggiano MP","Electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies suggest that our actions are initiated by unconscious mental processes long before awareness of intention to act. The time window between the awareness of the intention to move and the movement onset, which normally permits to exert a conscious ""veto"" on the impending action, is modulated by individual differences in trait impulsivity. In particular, trait impulsive people show a delayed awareness of the intention to act, probably exceeding the ""point of no return"", after which the action can no longer be inhibited. In order to investigate if individual differences in the ""veto"" interval might be explained by differences in the readiness potential (RP) dynamics, nineteen healthy participants underwent an impulsivity trait assessment using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and performed a task based on Libet's clock paradigm, during EEG recordings of pre-movement neural activity. We observed a positive relationship between impulsive personality trait and motor system excitability during the preparation of self-initiated movements. In particular, the RP showed an earlier negative rising phase and a greater amplitude, with the increasing of BIS-11 scores. Based on present results, we conclude hypothesizing that trait impulsivity might be characterized by less effective preparatory inhibition mechanisms, which have a fundamental role in the control of behavior.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29337234/

The aim is to adjust the drug dose to the real patient needs using heuristic knowledge provided by clinicians. A two-level computer decision system is proposed. The idea is to release the clinician from routine tasks so that he can focus on other variables of the patient.
The controller uses the Bispectral Index (BIS) to assess the hypnotic state of the patient. Fuzzy controller was included in a closed-loop system to reach the BIS target and reject disturbances. BIS was measured using a BIS VISTA monitor, a device capable of calculating the hypnosis level of the patient through EEG information. An infusion pump with propofol 1% is used to supply the drug to the patient. The inputs to the fuzzy inference system are BIS error and BIS rate. The output is infusion rate increment. The mapping of the input information and the appropriate output is given by a rule-base based on knowledge of clinicians.
To evaluate the performance of the fuzzy closed-loop system proposed, an observational study was carried out. Eighty one patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery were randomly distributed in 2 groups: one group using a fuzzy logic based closed-loop system (FCL) to automate the administration of propofol (42 cases); the second group using manual delivering of the drug (39 cases). In both groups, the BIS target was 50.
The FCL, designed with intuitive logic rules based on the clinician experience, performed satisfactorily and outperformed the manual administration in patients in terms of accuracy through the maintenance stage.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29310966/

This study examined the effect of the D2 receptor antagonist droperidol on sevoflurane anesthesia by examining α and slow wave electroencephalogram oscillations.
Forty-five patients, age 20 to 60 yr, were enrolled. Frontal electroencephalograms were continuously collected for offline analysis via Bispectral Index monitoring. After induction of anesthesia, end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was deliberately maintained at 1%, and intravenous droperidol (0.05 mg/kg bolus) was administered. Electroencephalogram changes were examined in power spectrum and bicoherence, before and 10 min after droperidol injection, then compared using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test and/or paired t test.
Droperidol significantly augmented the α-bicoherence peak induced by sevoflurane from 30.3% (24.2%, 42.4%) to 50.8% (41.7%, 55.2%) (median [25th, 75th percentiles]; P < 0.0001), Hodges-Lehman median difference, 15.8% (11.3 to 21.4%) (95% CI). The frequency of the α-bicoherence peak was simultaneously shifted to the lower frequency; from 11.5 (11.0, 13.0) to 10.5 (10.0, 11.0) Hz (median [25th, 75th percentiles], P < 0.0001).

Various community-training programmes have improved practices like bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation using automated external defibrillator (AED). Post-resuscitation care has also changed significantly in the millennium. Interventions like targeted temperature management (TTM), avoidance of hyperoxia and emergency cardiac catheterisation have given patients a chance of a better neurological outcome. Despite these timely interventions, it is still very difficult to predict neurological outcome. The European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ERC-ESICM) published guidance in 2015 with a strong recommendation to delay prognostication for at least 72 h and with an emphasis to adapt a multimodal approach, which includes neurological examination, biomarkers, electroencephalogram (EEG) and radiological tests. These interventions not only have cost attached to them, but the unpredictability has a significant emotional impact on family members. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring device acts on the principle of EEG and converts the waveform into an absolute number and also measures the burst suppression. We hypothesize that patients who have a low BIS value and high burst suppression within 24 h of presentation will have a poor neurological outcome. The primary objective of this review is to look at BIS monitor as a tool, which could help bring forward the timing of prognostication.
Electronic databases will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials and prospective or retrospective cohort studies with no language restrictions. The search will be supplemented with grey literature searches of thesis, dissertations and hand searching of relevant journals. Two independent reviewers will screen, select and perform analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) method. The selected studies will be analysed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Meta-analysis will be performed if suitable.
This review will synthesize the evidence on the use of BIS monitors within 24 h of achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and may help in early prognostication.

We explored resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in patients with GD according to the degree of impulsivity. Methods In total, 109 GD subjects were divided into three groups according to Barratt impulsiveness scale-11 (BIS-11) scores: high (HI; 25th percentile of BIS-11 scores, n = 29), middle (MI; 26th-74th percentile, n = 57), and low-impulsivity (LI) groups (75th percentile, n = 23). We used generalized estimating equations to analyze differences in EEG absolute power considering group (HI, MI, and LI), brain region (frontal, central, and posterior), and hemisphere (left, midline, and right) for each frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Results The results indicated that GD patients in the HI group showed decreased theta absolute power, and decreased alpha and beta absolute power in the left, right, particularly midline frontocentral regions. Discussion and conclusions This study is a novel attempt to reveal impulsive features in GD by neurophysiological methods. The results suggest different EEG patterns among GD patients according to the degree of impulsivity, raising the possibility of neurophysiological objective features in GD and helping clinicians in treating GD patients with impulsive features.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28856896/

Influence of arousal on bispectral index and sedation.,British journal of anaesthesia,2017,"Colin PJ, Hannivoort LN, Eleveld DJ, Reyntjens KMEM, Absalom AR, Vereecke HEM, Struys MMRF","Dexmedetomidine, a selective α 2 -adrenoreceptor agonist, has unique characteristics, such as maintained respiratory drive and production of arousable sedation. We describe development of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine, taking into account the effect of stimulation on its sedative properties.
In a two-period, randomized study in 18 healthy volunteers, dexmedetomidine was delivered in a step-up fashion by means of target-controlled infusion using the Dyck model. Volunteers were randomized to a session without background noise and a session with pre-recorded looped operating room background noise. Exploratory pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling and covariate analysis were conducted in NONMEM using bispectral index (BIS) monitoring of processed EEG.
We found that both stimulation at the time of Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale scoring and the presence or absence of ambient noise had an effect on the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine. The stimuli associated with MOAA/S scoring increased the BIS of sedated volunteers because of a transient 170% increase in the effect-site concentration necessary to reach half of the maximal effect. In contrast, volunteers deprived of ambient noise were more resistant to dexmedetomidine and required, on average, 32% higher effect-site concentrations for the same effect as subjects who were exposed to background operating room noise.
The new pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models might be used for effect-site rather than plasma concentration target-controlled infusion for dexmedetomidine in clinical practice, thereby allowing tighter control over the desired level of sedation.

However, clinical assessment of brain-death occurence is difficult in post-cardiac arrest patients, sedated, paralyzed, under mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH). Our objective was to assess the usefulness of Bispectral-Index (BIS) monitoring at bedside for an early detection of brain-death occurrence in refractory cardiac arrest patients treated by E-CPR.
This prospective study was performed in an intensive care unit of an university hospital. Forty-six patients suffering from refractory cardiac arrest treated by E-CPR were included. BIS was continuously recorded during ICU hospitalization. Clinical brain-death was confirmed when appropriate by EEG and/or cerebral CT angiography.
Twenty-nine patients evolved into brain-death and had average BIS values under MTH and after rewarming (temperature ≥35°C) of 4 (0-47) and 0 (0-82), respectively. Among these, 11 (38%) entered into a procedure of organs donation. Among the 17 non-brain-dead patients, the average BIS values at admission and after rewarming were 39 (0-65) and 59 (22-82), respectively. Two patients had on admission a BIS value equal to zero and evolved to a poor prognostic (CPC 4) and died after care limitations. BIS values were significantly different between patients who developed brain death and those who did not. In both groups, no differences were observed between the AUCs of ROC curves for BIS values under MTH and after rewarming (respectively 0.86 vs 0.83, NS).
Initial values of BIS could be used as an assessment tool for early detection of brain-death in refractory cardiac arrest patients treated by mild therapeutic hypothermia and E-CPR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28844933/

One hundred and twenty young (20-30 years), middle-aged (31-65 years), and elderly (66-80 years) patients were randomly allocated to receive either desflurane or sevoflurane (n = 20, each group). General anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg bolus and remifentanil 0.25 µg/kg/min, which was stopped after tracheal intubation. Maintenance of anesthesia was started with an end-tidal concentration of desflurane or sevoflurane at age-adjusted 1 MAC and maintained for 10 min, followed by 1-min assessment of bispectral index (BIS), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95), and amplitude of the electroencephalogram taken at 10-s intervals.
BIS and SEF95 in patients receiving 1 MAC desflurane were significantly lower than those receiving 1 MAC sevoflurane including all age groups [35 (29, 39) vs. 41 (38, 49); 12.53 (10.99, 13.95) Hz vs. 14.42 (12.99, 17.17) Hz median (25, 75 percentile), respectively, P < 0.001 for both].

The Austrian Society of Anesthesiology, Resuscitation and Intensive Care Medicine carried out an online survey of neurointensive care units in Austria in order to evaluate the current state of practice in the areas of analgosedation and delirium management in this high-risk patient group.
The response rate was 88%. Induction of anesthesia in patients with elevated intracranial pressure is carried out with propofol/fentanyl/rocuronium in >80% of the intensive care units (ICU), 60% use midazolam, 33.3% use esketamine, 13.3% use barbiturates and 6.7% use etomidate. For maintenance of analgosedation up to 72 h, propofol is used by 80% of the ICUs, followed by remifentanil (46.7%), sufentanil (40%) and fentanyl (6.7%). For long-term sedation, 86.7% of ICUs use midazolam, 73.3% sufentanil and 73.3% esketamine. For sedation periods longer than 7 days, 21.4% of ICUs use propofol.

Decades of research has linked approach motivation with greater relative left frontal-cortical asymmetry. Other research has linked avoidance motivation with greater relative right frontal-cortical asymmetry. However, past work linking withdrawal motivation with greater relative right frontal asymmetry has been mixed. The current article reviews evidence suggesting that activation of the regulatory system (revised Behavioral Inhibition System [r-BIS]) may be more strongly related to greater relative right frontal asymmetry than withdrawal motivation. Specifically, research suggests that greater activation of the r-BIS is associated with greater relative right frontal activity, and reduced r-BIS activation is associated with reduced right frontal activity (greater relative left frontal activity). We review evidence examining trait and state frontal activity using EEG, source localization, lesion studies, neuronal stimulation, and fMRI supporting the idea that r-BIS may be the core personality system related to greater relative right frontal activity. In addition, the current review seeks to disentangle avoidance motivation and r-BIS as substrates of relative right frontal asymmetry.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28675440/

However, the original BIS scale assesses both FFFS and r-BIS. Past work linking the BIS scale and right frontal activity does not indicate which system is related to right frontal activity. The current study (n = 182) examined frontal asymmetric activity with personality traits associated with approach (BAS), withdrawal (FFFS-Fear), behavioral inhibition (BIS-Anxiety) and impulsivity (UPPS-P). Resting frontal cortical activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG), and the traditional alpha band was examined. Greater BIS-Anxiety related to greater relative right frontal activity. Impulsivity related to less relative right frontal activity. BAS and FFFS-Fear (approach and withdrawal motivation) did not relate to asymmetric frontal activity.

As assumed by the RST-5, the results showed independent influences of approach/avoidance and gain/loss sensitivities on participants' behavior in risky choices. Individual approach/avoidance sensitivity was predicted by trait measures of the behavioral approach system (BAS) and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS), while no such correlation was present for gain/loss sensitivity. EEG recordings revealed relatively stronger left-frontal cortical activity for trials with approach motivation compared to conflict and avoidance motivation. On the individual level, relatively stronger left-frontal cortical activity was associated with trait BAS. In addition, activity changes in frontal EEG asymmetry were associated relatively higher behavioral approach sensitivity.

In this case, bispectral index (BIS) monitoring, a specific electroencephalogram-derived monitoring, can be used to find the optimal seizure induction time during anesthesia to elicit adequate seizures. A measurement of seizure adequacy in electroencephalogram is the postictal suppression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of seizure induction time on the degree of postictal suppression by comparing BIS versus no-BIS monitoring in MST and ECT.
Twenty patients with treatment-resistant depression were randomly assigned to either MST or ECT. Each patient underwent 3 treatments with the determination of seizure induction time by defined prestimulation BIS (BIS condition) and 3 treatments with determination of seizure induction time by controlled clinical trial protocol (no-BIS condition). Statistical analysis was calculated by repeated-measures analysis of variance.
The degree of postictal suppression was more pronounced in both MST and ECT, with BIS monitoring. In this connection, no differences between MST and ECT were found. Seizure induction time was significantly later in the BIS condition (181.3 ± 6 seconds) compared with the no-BIS condition (114.3 ± 12 seconds) (P < 0.001).
Adequacy of seizures, in the form of the degree of postictal suppression, was superior by determining the seizure induction time with BIS in both MST and ECT.

Electroencephalography (EEG) of end-stage ALS patients has reportedly shown specific features based on neuronal network modulations, differing from EEG of other patients with cognitive failure and dementia. However, EEG of end-stage ALS patients during anaesthesia has not yet been reported. A 64-year-old male ALS patient with locked-in state (LIS), supported by tracheostomy positive-pressure ventilation (TPPV) and enteral nourishment for 9years, underwent scheduled general anaesthesia for repair of a fractured mandible. He could blink and open his eyes, but seldom opened or closed his eyes on instruction. Sevoflurane anaesthesia was induced under continuous EEG monitoring with bispectral index (BIS), which is commonly used to examine the level of anaesthesia. Prominent alpha oscillations with lower peak frequency and high amplitude appeared during anaesthesia, differing from the characteristics of EEG seen in patients with general cognitive failure. Conversely, BIS reflected the sevoflurane concentration in this ALS patient, similar to healthy individuals, and BIS monitoring was useful for estimating the depth of anaesthesia. The prominent alpha oscillation revealed in this rare case report may suggest modulation of the functional neuronal network system during anaesthesia in patients with progressive ALS, in a manner quite different from typical dementia patients. EEG abnormalities in the present ALS patient did not influence the availability of BIS monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28522369/

Determination of quasi-periodicities in electroencephalogram (EEG) is a candidate for quantifying the changes in the depth of anesthesia (DOA). In this paper, DOA monitoring capacity of periodicities detected using PRSA was quantified by assessing EEG signals collected from 56 patients during surgery. The method is compared with sample entropy (SampEn), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and permutation entropy (PE). The performance of quasi-periodicities defined by deceleration capacity and acceleration capacity was tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Pearson correlation coefficient. During the surgery, a significant difference ( ) in the quasi-periodicities was observed among three different stages under general anesthesia. There is a larger mean AUC and correlation coefficient of quasi-periodicities compared with SampEn, DFA, and PE using expert assessment of conscious level and bispectral index as the gold standard, respectively. Quasi-periodicities detected using PRSA in EEG signals are a powerful monitor of DOA and perform more accurate and robust results compared with SampEn, DFA, and PE.

Whether casual mobile game playing has a cognitive, physiological, or behavioral effect on players whose game use is not pathological is unknown. Here we explored whether preattentive auditory processing is linked to the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) in frequent and infrequent game players. A total of 74 subjects who were enrolled in our study were divided into two groups, 40 subjects were frequent gamers and 34 subjects were age-, gender-, IQ-, and education-matched infrequent gamers. All participants underwent a passive auditory oddball paradigm and completed the behavioral inhibition/behavioral activation system scales. The mismatch negativity (MMN) latency was shorter for the frequent gamers relative to the infrequent gamers, whereas no difference in MMN amplitude was found between groups. MMN amplitude was negatively associated with the degree of behavioral inhibition in the frequent and infrequent gaming group. We also found that those who frequently play games show an enhanced processing speed, which could be an effect of game practice. Greater behavioral inhibition induces increased vigilance, and this may have enhanced the MMN amplitude in the infrequent gamers. This differential pattern of correlations suggests that differences in the BIS could lead to different approaches to auditory information processing.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28263679/

The performance of the controller is investigated and characterized with real dataset of 8 patients undergoing surgery. Results of this in silico study indicate that for all the patients, with 0% overshoot observed, the steady state error lies in between ±5.

Practically, anesthesia is only seen as too deep when evidence of burst-suppression is seen. We designed an experiment to help towards better assessment of individual anesthetic needs. First, to mark the Ce (effect-site concentration) of propofol at loss of response to calling name and gently shaking shoulders (LOR), we defined Ce-LOR. To mark the transient power increase in the alpha range (9-14 Hz), common to all patients, when propofol concentration gradually increases, we defined Ce-alpha as the highest recorded alpha power for Ce. We also defined Ce-OBS as the Ce of propofol at initial observation of burst-suppression. Then we tried to predict Ce-LOR and Ce-alpha from Ce-OBS, vice versa, and considered the significance of these parameters.
We enrolled 26 female patients (age 33-65) who were undergoing scheduled mastectomy. During anesthesia, we recorded all raw EEG packets as well as EEG-derived parameters on a computer from BIS-XP™ monitor. Propofol was infused using a TCI pump.

EEG data were replayed to BIS and qCON with an EEG player. We calculated the Spearman correlation to evaluate similarities in index trend behavior and estimated the general index agreement of displaying the same anesthetic level, i.e., wakefulness, sedation and anesthesia. We used coughing episodes and the bronchoscope placement to investigate the index for possible arousal reactions.

Power spectral analysis is an important method for feature detection in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Several spectral parameters derived from EEG have been proposed for measuring DOA in clinical applications. In the present paper, an improved method based on phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) is designed to improve the predictive accuracy of relative alpha and beta power, a frequency band power ratio, total power, median frequency (MF), spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), and spectral entropy for assessing anesthetic drug effects. Fifty-six patients undergoing general anesthesia in an operating theatre are studied. All EEG signals are continuously recorded from the awake state to the end of the recovery state and then filtered using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). All parameters are evaluated using the commercial bispectral index (BIS) and expert assessment of conscious level (EACL), respectively. The ability to predict DOA is estimated using the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC). All indicators based on the improved method can clearly discriminate the conscious state from the anesthetized state after filtration (p  <  0.05). A significantly larger mean AUC (p  <  0.05) shows that the improved method performs better than the conventional method to measure the DOA in most circumstances. Especially for raw EEG contaminated by artifacts, when the BIS index is used to indicate the consciousness level, the improvement is 7.37% (p  <  0.05), 9.04% (p  <  0.05), 18.46% (p  <  0.05), 27.73% (p  <  0.05), 14.65% (p  <  0.05), 2.52%, 5.38% and 6.24% (p  <  0.05) for relative alpha and beta power, power ratio, total power, MF, SEF, RE and SE, respectively.

We hypothesized that the bispectral index (BIS), a quantified electroencephalogram instrument, would accurately detect deep levels of sedation.
We prospectively enrolled 90 critically ill mechanically ventilated patients who were receiving sedation. The BIS was monitored for 24 hours and compared with the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) evaluated every 4 hours. Deep sedation was defined as a RASS of -3 to -5. Threshold values of baseline BIS (the lowest value before RASS assessment) and stimulated BIS (the highest value after standardized assessment) for detecting deep sedation were determined in a training set (45 patients, 262 RASS assessments). Diagnostic accuracy was then analyzed in a validation set (45 patients, 264 RASS assessments).
Deep sedation was only prescribed in 6 (6.7%) patients, but 76 patients (84.4%) had at least 1 episode of deep sedation. Thresholds for detecting deep sedation of 50 for baseline and 80 for stimulated BIS were identified, with respective areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.771 (95% confidence interval, 0.714-0.828) and 0.805 (0.752-0.857). The sensitivity and specificity of baseline BIS were 94.0% and 66.5% and of stimulated BIS were 91.0% and 66.5%. When baseline and stimulated BIS were combined, the sensitivity, specificity, and clinical utility index were 85.0% (76.1%-91.1%), 85.9% (79.5%-90.7%), and 66.9% (57.8%-76.0%), respectively.
Combining baseline and stimulated BIS may help detect deep sedation in mechanically ventilated patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28027085/
27995430,EEG artifacts reduction by multivariate empirical mode decomposition and multiscale entropy for monitoring depth of anaesthesia during surgery.,Medical & biological engineering & computing,2017,"Liu Q, Chen YF, Fan SZ, Abbod MF, Shieh JS","Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely utilized to measure the depth of anaesthesia (DOA) during operation. However, the EEG signals are usually contaminated by artifacts which have a consequence on the measured DOA accuracy. In this study, an effective and useful filtering algorithm based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition and multiscale entropy (MSE) is proposed to measure DOA. Mean entropy of MSE is used as an index to find artifacts-free intrinsic mode functions. The effect of different levels of artifacts on the performances of the proposed filtering is analysed using simulated data. Furthermore, 21 patients' EEG signals are collected and analysed using sample entropy to calculate the complexity for monitoring DOA. The correlation coefficients of entropy and bispectral index (BIS) results show 0.14 ± 0.30 and 0.63 ± 0.09 before and after filtering, respectively. Artificial neural network (ANN) model is used for range mapping in order to correlate the measurements with BIS. The ANN method results show strong correlation coefficient (0.75 ± 0.08). The results in this paper verify that entropy values and BIS have a strong correlation for the purpose of DOA monitoring and the proposed filtering method can effectively filter artifacts from EEG signals. The proposed method performs better than the commonly used wavelet denoising method. This study provides a fully adaptive and automated filter for EEG to measure DOA more accuracy and thus reduce risk related to maintenance of anaesthetic agents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27995430/

This study evaluated whether the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potential (LDAEP), a potential biological marker of central serotonergic activity, could reflect emotional sensitivity and impulsivity. A total of 157 healthy individuals were recruited, who performed LDAEP and Go/Nogo paradigms during electroencephalogram measurement. Barratt impulsivity scale (BIS), Conners' Adult ADHD rating scale (CAARS), and affective lability scale (ALS) were evaluated. Comparison between low and high LDAEP groups was conducted for behavioural, psychological, and event-related potential (ERP) measures. The high LDAEP group showed significantly increased BIS, a subscale of the CAARS, ALS, and false alarm rate of Nogo stimuli compared to the low LDAEP group. LDAEP showed significant positive correlations with the depression scale, ALS scores, subscale of the CAARS and Nogo-P3 amplitude. In the source activity of Nogo-P3, the cuneus, lingual gyrus, and precentral gyrus activities were significantly increased in the high LDAEP group.

However, data indicate that the bispectral index (BIS), a processed electroencephalography monitoring system, may not be reliable for assessing the depth of anaesthesia.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the BIS monitoring system to assess changes in the level of unconsciousness, specifically during the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness, in patients undergoing total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol. We compared BIS with the electroencephalogram (EEG), and clinical loss of consciousness (LOC) defined as loss of verbal commands and eyelash reflex.
This was an observational cohort study.
University Hospital Linköping, University Hospital Örebro, Finspång Hospital and Kalmar Hospital, Sweden from October 2011 to April 2013.
A total of 35 ASA I patients aged 18 to 49 years were recruited.
The patients underwent total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil for elective day-case surgery. Changes in clinical levels of consciousness were assessed by BIS and compared with assessment of stage 3 neurophysiological activity using the EEG. The plasma concentrations of propofol were measured at clinical LOC and 20 and 30 min after LOC.
The primary outcome was measurement of BIS, EEG and clinical LOC.
The median BIS value at clinical LOC was 38 (IQR 30 to 43), and the BIS values varied greatly between patients. There was no correlation between BIS values and EEG stages at clinical LOC (r = -0.1, P = 0.064). Propofol concentration reached a steady state within 20 min.
There was no statistically significant correlation between BIS and EEG at clinical LOC. BIS monitoring may not be a reliable method for determining LOC.

It was hypothesised that CCS would respond to the hypnotic component of anaesthesia and CI would differentiate between two groups of patients receiving different doses of fentanyl. Twenty-five patients scheduled to undergo elective first-time coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomised to receive a total fentanyl dose of either 12 μg/kg (fentanyl low dose, FLD) or 24 μg/kg (fentanyl moderate dose, FMD), both administered in two divided doses. Propofol was used for anaesthesia induction and pancuronium for intraoperative paralysis. Hemodynamic management was protocolised using vasoactive drugs. BIS, CCS and CI were simultaneously recorded. Response of the indices (CI, CCS and BIS) to propofol and their differences between the two groups at specific points from anaesthesia induction through to aortic cannulation were investigated. Following propofol induction, CCS and BIS but not CI showed a significant reduction. Following the first dose of fentanyl, CI, CCS and BIS decreased in both groups. Following the second dose of fentanyl, there was a significant reduction in CI in the FLD group but not the FMD group, with no significant change found for BIS or CCS in either group. The BAR monitor demonstrates the potential to monitor the level of hypnosis following anaesthesia induction with propofol via the CCS index and to facilitate the titration of fentanyl as a component of balanced anaesthesia via the CI index.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26407878/

This effort is currently limited by the need to collect raw EEG data directly from patients.
A procedural method to synthesize EEG signals was implemented in a mobile software application. The application is capable of sending the simulated signal to an anesthesia depth of hypnosis monitor. Systematic sweeps of the simulator generate functional monitor response profiles reminiscent of how network analyzers are used to test electronic components.
Three commercial anesthesia monitors (Entropy, NeuroSENSE, and BIS) were compared with this new technology, and significant response and feature variations between the monitor models were observed; this includes reproducible, nonmonotonic apparent multistate behavior and significant hysteresis at light levels of anesthesia.
Anesthesia monitor response to a procedural simulator can reveal significant differences in internal signal processing algorithms.

Greater activation in the left frontal cortex is related to ""approach"" motivation, while greater activation in the right cortex is associated with ""withdrawal"" motivation. Moreover, resting FAA is stable over time among adults. This stability has not been demonstrated among adolescents, and the correspondence between resting FAA and personality has been inconsistently observed. The present study examined stability of FAA and the association between resting FAA and behavioral activation among adolescents. At baseline and 4 months, 99 adolescents completed a resting electroencephalogram (EEG) and a pencil-and-paper measure of personality (BIS/BAS). FAA showed good stability over time (Intra-class correlation coefficient=0.65, p<0.001), but there was no correlation between FAA and personality.

Monitoring systems based on the frontal EEG/EMG, or autonomic state reactions (e.g. heart rate and blood pressure) have been developed aiming to objectively assess this balance. In this study a new multivariate indicator of patients' steady-state during anesthesia (STAN) is proposed, based on wavelet analysis of signals linked to noxious activation. A clinical protocol was designed to analyze precise noxious stimuli (laryngoscopy/intubation, tetanic, and incision), under three different analgesic doses; patients were randomized to receive either remifentanil 2.0, 3.0 or 4.0 ng/ml. ECG, PPG, BP, BIS, EMG and [Formula: see text] were continuously recorded. ECG, PPG and BP were processed to extract beat-to-beat information, and [Formula: see text] curve used to estimate the respiration rate. A combined steady-state index based on wavelet analysis of these variables, was applied and compared between the three study groups and stimuli (Wilcoxon signed ranks, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests). Following institutional approval and signing the informed consent thirty four patients were enrolled in this study (3 excluded due to signal loss during data collection). The BIS index of the EEG, frontal EMG, heart rate, BP, and PPG wave amplitude changed in response to different noxious stimuli. Laryngoscopy/intubation was the stimulus with the more pronounced response [Formula: see text]. These variables were used in the construction of the combined index STAN; STAN responded adequately to noxious stimuli, with a more pronounced response to laryngoscopy/intubation (18.5-43.1 %, [Formula: see text]), and the attenuation provided by the analgesic, detecting steady-state periods in the different physiological signals analyzed (approximately 50 % of the total study time). A new multivariate approach for the assessment of the patient steady-state during general anesthesia was developed.

The use of the bispectral index (BIS) for monitoring depth of anesthesia during different types of surgery, including epilepsy surgery, is increasing nowadays. The BIS is an EEG-derived variable indicating cortical electrical activity. However, the correlation between the BIS score and the iECoG score, with the purpose of optimizing the quality and time of the iECoG recordings in epilepsy surgery is unknown. The goal of this study was to evaluate the correlation between BIS values and iECoG parameters during the epilepsy surgery under anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl. This is a prospective study that included patients with epilepsy who underwent epilepsy surgery guided by BIS and iECoG (September 2008 to October 2013). Clinical, physiological, and sociodemographic characteristics are shown. We correlated the iECoG parameters (presence of burst suppressions [BS], suppression time [seconds], background frequency [Hz], and type of iECoG score by Mathern et al) with BIS values. We included 28 patients, 15/28 (53.5%) female, general mean age of 30.5 years (range 13-56 years). Patients underwent epilepsy surgery: 22/28 (79%) temporal and 6/28 (21%) extratemporal. We found a nonlinear polynomial cubic relationship between the mentioned variables noting that a BIS range of 40 to 60 gave the following results: iECoG BS periods <5 seconds, background frequency 10 to 17 Hz, and iECoG score 2 characterized by lack of >20-Hz background frequencies. No BS were observed with a BIS > 60. In conclusion BIS values and iECoG parameters during the epilepsy surgery under anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl have a nonlinear correlation. BS patterns were not found with a BIS > 60. These findings show that BIS is a nonlinear multidimensional measure, which possesses high variability with the iECoG parameters. BS patterns are not found with BIS > 60.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27325591/

Firstly, the measured EEG signals are denoised and decomposed into 20 different frequency bands. The Mobility (M), permutation entropy (PE) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LCZ) of each frequency band are calculated. The M, PE and LCZ values of beta frequency bands (21.5-30 Hz) are selected to derive a new index. The new index is evaluated and compared with measured bispectral (BIS). The results show that there is a very close correlation between the proposed index and the BIS during different anaesthetic states. The new index also shows a 25-264 s earlier time response than BIS during the transient period of anaesthetic states.

The objective of this systematic review was to determine whether using a depth of anaesthesia monitoring device improves the safety and efficacy of sedation.
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Electronic databases (CENTRAL; Medline; CINAHL) were searched up to May 2015.
Randomised controlled trials that compared use of a depth of anaesthesia monitoring device to a control group who received standard monitoring during procedural sedation and analgesia were included. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment (Cochrane risk of bias tool) were performed by two reviewers. Safety outcomes were hypoxaemia, hypotension and adverse events. Efficacy outcomes were amount of sedation used, duration of sedation recovery and rate of incomplete procedures.
A total of 16 trials (2138 participants) were included. Evidence ratings were downgraded to either low or moderate quality due to study limitations and imprecision. Meta-analysis of 8 trials (766 participants) found no difference in hypoxaemia (RR 0.87; 95% CI=0.67-1.12). No statistically significant difference in hypotension was observed in meta-analysis of 8 trials (RR 0.96; 95% CI=0.54-1.7; 942 participants).

Depth of anaesthesia monitoring did impact sedation titration during interventional procedures with propofol infusions. For this reason, it seems reasonable for anaesthetists to utilise a depth of anaesthesia monitoring device for select populations of patients if it is decided that limiting the amount of sedation would be beneficial for the individual patient. However, there is no need to invest in purchasing extra equipment or training staff who are not familiar with this technology (e.g. nurses who do not routinely use a depth of anaesthesia monitoring device during general anaesthesia) because there is no high quality evidence suggestive of clear clinical benefits for patient safety or sedation efficacy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27236824/

Sedation level can be measured with EEG monitoring with the bispectral index (BIS) monitor.
To determine the feasibility and validity of BIS monitoring in terminally ill patients.
In this prospective study, BIS registrations were performed in unconscious end-of-life patients admitted to a palliative care center. Validated scores were used to measure level of sedation (Ramsay score), pain (Numeric Rating Scale or Rotterdam Elderly Pain Observations Scale), delirium (Delirium Observation Screening score), and overall comfort (Numeric Rating Scale). Validity and sensitivity to change of BIS values were considered, and the effects of medication and the time till death on BIS values were evaluated in a linear mixed model analysis.
Fifty-eight patients were included for analysis. BIS monitoring was acceptable to patients, relatives, and medical staff. BIS values were moderately correlated with Ramsay scores (0.46) but were highly variable for deeply sedated patients. BIS values changed significantly before and after a midazolam dose (P < 0.001). Midazolam treatment resulted on average in a statistically significant reduction of the BIS values (-4.5, 95% CI -7.0 to -2.0), whereas morphine and haloperidol did not.
This is one of the first validation studies in which BIS monitoring in end-of-life patients is described. BIS monitoring is feasible in unconscious terminally ill patients.

It is now possible to measure depth of anaesthesia using electroencephalography (EEG). Entropy, an EEG-based monitor can be used to assess the depth of anaesthesia using a strip of electrodes applied to the forehead, and this can guide intraoperative anaesthetic drug administration.
The primary objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of entropy monitoring in facilitating faster recovery from general anaesthesia. We also wanted to assess mortality at 24 hours, 30 days, and one year following general anaesthesia with entropy monitoring.The secondary objectives were to assess the effectiveness of the entropy monitor in: preventing postoperative recall of intraoperative events (awareness) following general anaesthesia; reducing the amount of anaesthetic drugs used; reducing cost of the anaesthetic as well as in reducing time to readiness to leave the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU).
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1990 to September 2014) and EMBASE via Ovid SP (1990 to September 2014). We reran the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE via Ovid SP and EMBASE via Ovid SP in January 2016. We added one potential new study of interest to the list of 'Studies awaiting Classification' and we will incorporate this study into the formal review findings during the review update.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in adults and children (aged greater than two years of age), where in one arm entropy monitoring was used for titrating anaesthesia, and in the other standard practice (increase in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, lacrimation, movement in response to noxious surgical stimuli) was used for titrating anaesthetic drug administration. We also included trials with an additional third arm, wherein another EEG monitor, the Bispectral index (BIS) monitor was used to assess anaesthetic depth.
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently extracted details of trial methodology and outcome data from trials considered eligible for inclusion. All analyses were made on an intention-to-treat basis. We used a random-effect model where there was heterogeneity. For assessments of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome that included pooled data from RCTs, we downgraded evidence from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect or potential publication bias).
We included 11 RCTs (962 participants). Eight RCTs (762 participants) were carried out on adults (18 to 80 years of age), two (128 participants) involved children (two to 16 years) and one RCT (72 participants) included patients aged 60 to 75 years. Of the 11 included studies, we judged three to be at low risk of bias, and the remaining eight RCTs at unclear or high risk of bias.Six RCTs (383 participants) estimated the primary outcome, time to awakening after stopping general anaesthesia, which was reduced in the entropy as compared to the standard practice group (mean difference (MD) -5.42 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.77 to -2.08; moderate quality of evidence). We noted heterogeneity for this outcome; on performing subgroup analysis this was found to be due to studies that included participants undergoing major, long duration surgeries (off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, major urological surgery). The MD for time to awakening with four studies on ambulatory procedures was -3.20 minutes (95% CI -3.94 to -2.45). No trial reported the second primary outcome, mortality at 24 hours, 30 days, and one year with the use of entropy monitoring.Eight trials (797 participants) compared the secondary outcome, postoperative recall of intraoperative events (awareness) in the entropy and standard practice groups. Awareness was reported by only one patient in the standard practice group, making meaningful estimation of benefit of entropy monitoring difficult; moderate quality of evidence.All 11 RCTs compared the amount of anaesthetic agent used between the entropy and standard practice groups. Six RCTs compared the amount of propofol, four compared the amount of sevoflurane and one the amount of isoflurane used between the groups. Analysis of three studies (166 participants) revealed that the MD of propofol consumption between the entropy group and control group was -11.56 mcg/kg/min (95% CI -24.05 to 0.92); low quality of evidence. Analysis of another two studies (156 participants) showed that the MD in sevoflurane consumption in the entropy group compared to the control group was -3.42 mL (95% CI -6.49 to -0.35); moderate quality of evidence.No trial reported on the secondary outcome of the cost of general anaesthesia.Three trials (170 participants) estimated MD in time to readiness to leave the PACU of the entropy group as compared to the control group (MD -5.94 minutes, 95% CI -16.08 to 4.20; low quality of evidence). Heterogeneity was noted, which was due to the difference in anaesthetic technique (propofol-based general anaesthesia) in one study. The remaining two studies had used volatile-based general anaesthesia. The MD in time to readiness to leave the PACU was -4.17 minutes (95% CI -6.84 to -1.51) with these two studies.
The evidence as regards time to awakening, recall of intraoperative awareness and reduction in inhalational anaesthetic agent use was of moderate quality. The quality of evidence of as regards reduction in intravenous anaesthetic agent (propofol) use, as well as time to readiness to leave the PACU was found to be of low quality. As the data are limited, further studies consisting of more participants will be required for ascertaining benefits of entropy monitoring.Further studies are needed to assess the effect of entropy monitoring on focal issues such as short-term and long-term mortality, as well as cost of general anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26976247/
26956807,Deficit in rewarding mechanisms and prefrontal left/right cortical effect in vulnerability for internet addiction.,Acta neuropsychiatrica,2016,"Balconi M, Finocchiaro R","The present research explored the cortical correlates of rewarding mechanisms and cortical 'unbalance' effect in internet addiction (IA) vulnerability.
Internet Addiction Inventory (IAT) and personality trait (Behavioural Inhibition System, BIS; Behavioural Activation System, BAS) were applied to 28 subjects. Electroencephalographic (EEG, alpha frequency band) and response times (RTs) were registered during a Go-NoGo task execution in response to different online stimuli: gambling videos, videogames or neutral stimuli. Higher-IAT (more than 50 score, with moderate or severe internet addiction) and lower-IAT (<50 score, with no internet addiction).
Alpha band and RTs were affected by IAT, with significant bias (reduced RTs) for high-IAT in response to gambling videos and videogames; and by BAS, BAS-Reward subscale (BAS-R), since not only higher-IAT, but also BAS and BAS-R values determined an increasing of left prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity (alpha reduction) in response to videogames and gambling stimuli for both Go and NoGo conditions, in addition to decreased RTs for these stimuli categories.
The increased PFC responsiveness and the lateralisation (left PFC hemisphere) effect in NoGo condition was explained on the basis of a 'rewarding bias' towards more rewarding cues and a deficit in inhibitory control in higher-IAT and higher-BAS subjects. In contrast lower-IAT and lower-BAS predicted a decreased PFC response and increased RTs for NoGo (inhibitory mechanism). These results may support the significance of personality (BAS) and IAT measures for explaining future internet addiction behaviour based on this observed 'vulnerability'.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26956807/
26943841,The influence of depth of anesthesia on motor evoked potential response during awake craniotomy.,Journal of neurosurgery,2017,"Ohtaki S, Akiyama Y, Kanno A, Noshiro S, Hayase T, Yamakage M, Mikuni N","OBJECTIVE Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) are a critical indicator for monitoring motor function during neurological surgery. In this study, the influence of depth of anesthesia on MEP response was assessed. METHODS Twenty-eight patients with brain tumors who underwent awake craniotomy were included in this study. From a state of deep anesthesia until the awake state, MEP amplitude and latency were measured using 5-train electrical bipolar stimulations on the same site of the precentral gyrus each minute during the surgery. The depth of anesthesia was evaluated using the bispectral index (BIS). BIS levels were classified into 7 stages: < 40, and from 40 to 100 in groups of 10 each. MEP amplitude and latency of each stage were compared. The deviation of the MEP measurements, which was defined as a fluctuation from the average in every BIS stage, was also considered. RESULTS A total of 865 MEP waves in 28 cases were evaluated in this study. MEP amplitude was increased and latency was decreased in accordance with the increases in BIS level. The average MEP amplitudes in the > 90 BIS level was approximately 10 times higher than those in the < 40 BIS level. Furthermore, the average MEP latencies in the > 90 BIS level were 1.5-3.1 msec shorter than those in the < 60 BIS level. The deviation of measured MEP amplitudes in the > 90 BIS level was significantly stabilized in comparison with that in the < 60 BIS level. CONCLUSIONS MEP amplitude and latency were closely correlated with depth of anesthesia. In addition, the deviation in MEP amplitude was also correlated with depth of anesthesia, which was smaller during awake surgery (high BIS level) than during deep anesthesia. Therefore, MEP measurement would be more reliable in the awake state than under deep anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26943841/

Bispectral index (BIS) is the most widely utilized technology that uses electroencephalogram to provide a measurement of anesthetic depth. There are no definitive guidelines on when BIS should be used. Our aim was to assess actual patterns of intraoperative use of BIS by anesthesia professionals. We retrospectively collected intraoperative data on 55,210 surgical cases at a tertiary care hospital. Variables collected included: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, anesthesia provider type and level of training, use of inhalational anesthetics versus total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), utilization of nitrous oxide, utilization of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade, emergency status of surgery, airway type, case duration, and surgical subspecialty. A univariate logistic regression model was fitted. Subsequently, a multivariate logistic regression model was applied. Covariates utilized for the model included age, anesthesia provider level, and length of case. Factors associated with BIS use included increased age, greater ASA physical status, extremes of BMI, use of TIVA, use of a long-acting paralytic agent, use of an endotracheal tube (ETT), emergency surgery, increasing length of case, and certain surgical services. BIS use was associated with previously documented risk factors for intraoperative awareness. These factors are also indicators of case complexity, which may be a major factor among providers deciding when to apply BIS monitoring in the operating room.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26897034/

26771265,A Randomized Controlled Trial to Determine the Effect of Depth of Anesthesia on Emergence Agitation in Children.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2016,"Frederick HJ, Wofford K, de Lisle Dear G, Schulman SR","The cause of emergence agitation (EA) in children is unknown. Rapid emergence from inhaled anesthesia has been implicated because EA is more common with sevoflurane than with halothane. A dose-dependent effect of sevoflurane, which increases seizure-like electroencephalogram activity, has also been proposed.
To determine whether depth of anesthesia as measured by bispectral index (BIS) affects EA, 40 ASA physical status I to II children aged 2 to 8 years undergoing ophthalmic surgery were enrolled in a blinded randomized controlled trial of low-normal (40-45, deep) versus high-normal (55-60, light) anesthesia. To distinguish transient irritability from severe EA, the primary outcome was first-stage postanesthesia care unit (PACU I) peak Pediatric Assessment of Emergence Delirium (PAED) score, with secondary outcomes of PAED and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scores at emergence, postoperative fentanyl dose, emergence time, and discharge time. Subjects received a standard anesthesia protocol with oral midazolam followed by mask induction with sevoflurane 8%, fentanyl 1 to 1.5 μg/kg IV (then as needed), neuromuscular blockade, and endotracheal intubation. Providers titrated expired sevoflurane (in N2O 67%) from 0.5% to 3% to maintain BIS range. PAED, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scores were measured at emergence, at PACU I arrival, and during PACU I stay.
There was little difference between the groups in the primary outcome, peak PACU I PAED score (light: 7.7 ± 4.6; deep: 8.6 ± 5.3; mean difference, 0.9; 95% confidence interval, 4.1 to -2.3; effect size, 0.18). Discharge times were similar between groups. Treatment for severe EA was rare.
There was no significant effect of BIS-guided deep versus light anesthesia on severe EA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26771265/
29444393,Two different techniques of facial mask induction of anesthesia in children provide identical intubation conditions despite different anesthetic depth.,Acta anaesthesiologica Belgica,2016,"Hallet C, Venneman I, Hans G, Bonhomme V","Sevoflurane induction in chil- dren is performed using different techniques. Constricted, centered, and symmetrical pupils (CCSP) are classically the endpoint to be achieved before laryngoscopy is performed.
We investigated whether two different inhalation induction techniques with the same clinical end- point provided similar intubating conditions and comparable depth of anesthesia as assessed by the Bispectral Index (BIS).
Following IRB approval, and informed parental consent, 20 children were recruited. They were sched- uled for general anesthesia with tracheal intubation, and randomly assigned to Group 1, where the practitioner used 6% inspired sevoflurane in 50% 0₂/N₂0, and no manually assisted ventilation, or Group 2, where inspired sevoflurane was 8% in 50% 0₂/N₂0, and ventilation was manually supported upon loss of consciousness. BIS values were blinded. Laryngoscopy was performed after CCSP. Intubation conditions scoring was based on jaw relaxation (mobile = 1, partially mobile = 2, fixed = 3), position of vocal cords (open = 1, half-closed = 2, closed = 3), and cough (no cough = 1, 1 or 2 coughing efforts = 2, persistent coughing = 3). A total score > 3 corresponded to non-optimal conditions.
Upon CCSP, BIS values were significantly lower in Group 1 [mean (SD) : 30 (8) - 48 (18), p <0.001], despite significantly higher end-tidal sevoflurane concentration in Group 2 [mean (SD) : 5.0 (0.7) - 6.2 (0.5) ; p <0.001]. Time to CCSP was slightly shorter in Group 2. Intubation conditions were always optimal except for one patient of Group 1.
Both induction techniques achieve good intubating conditions. Possible explanations for the between-group BIS difference include variable appreciation of the CCSP endpoint, different induction lengths or sevoflurane equilibration times, or sevoflurane-induced increase in electroencephalogram power. A better indicator of the best time to intubate is needed to avoid too deep anesthesia in children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29444393/

In addition, we explored whether EEG functional connectivity is associated with trait impulsivity. Absolute and relative powers and Synchronization Likelihood (SL) as a measure of functional connectivity were analyzed in 15 AUD women and fifteen controls matched in age, gender and education. Correlation analysis between self-report impulsivity as measured by the Barratt impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and SL values of AUD patients were performed. Our results showed increased absolute and relative beta power in AUD patients compared to matched controls, and reduced functional connectivity in AUD patients predominantly in the beta and alpha bands. Impaired connectivity was distributed at fronto-central and occipito-parietal regions in the alpha band, and over the entire scalp in the beta band. We also found that impaired functional connectivity particularly in alpha band at fronto-central areas was negative correlated with non-planning dimension of impulsivity. These findings suggest that functional brain abnormalities are present in AUD patients and a disruption of resting-state EEG functional connectivity is associated with psychopathological traits of addictive behavior.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26660886/
26621628,Can Intraoperative Processed EEG Predict Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction in the Elderly?,Clinical therapeutics,2015,"Deiner S, Luo X, Silverstein JH, Sano M","Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a serious and costly complication of the elderly; even mild impairment has the potential to impact overall well being. Anesthesiologists continue to search for ways to manipulate intraoperative technique to optimize postoperative cognition in the elderly. Depth of anesthesia during surgery is an area that has shown some promise for short-term outcomes, such as delirium. However, excessive depth has both positive and negative associations with longer-term POCD. We hypothesize that this uncertainty is due to the inability of median depth to capture the amount of burst suppression or electrical silence. In this study, our purpose was to identify the intraoperative processed EEG parameters that are most closely correlated with POCD.
To explore the association of several processed EEG parameters with POCD, we performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 105 patients aged >68 years scheduled for major surgery under general anesthesia. Intraoperative medications, hemodynamics, processed EEG and cerebral oxygen saturation were recorded. All patients had a cognitive battery before surgery and repeated at 3 months afterward.
One hundred and five patients enrolled and 77 (73.3%) patients completed the 3-month cognitive testing. The incidence of POCD was 27%; the median Bispectral Index value for patients who developed POCD was similar to patients who did not (46 vs 42 minutes). However, patients who developed POCD spent less time with Bispectral Index <45 minutes (82.8 vs 122.5 minutes, P = 0.01) and burst suppression (35 vs 96 minutes, P = 0.04). Hypotension, cerebral desaturation, and use of total intravenous anesthesia were similar between patients with and without POCD.
Patients who developed POCD spent less time in EEG burst suppression and less time in deep states. Burst suppression may be protective for POCD. Further work is needed to definitively identify the role of burst suppression in the context of other patient and intraoperative variables to prevent POCD.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26621628/

We hypothesized that CDSA could be helpful for monitoring NCSE in critically subjects if continuous EEG (cEEG) is not available.
we retrospectively analyzed comatose patients admitted to our neurological intensive care unit (NICU) from 2011 to 2014 with a diagnosis of definitive NCSE that underwent b-BIS monitoring for at least 24h to guide anesthetic sedation. Clinical, electroencephalography and neuroimaging findings were analyzed. Moreover, all parameters from the b-BIS data including the CDSA were reviewed during periods of NCSE (NCSE pattern) and profound sedation (sedation pattern).
15 NCSE patients were included. The delay from the diagnosis of NCSE to the onset of b-BIS monitoring was 8 (0.5-31)h and total time of b-BIS monitoring 7.8±6.5 days. CDSA during NCSE pattern was characterized by continuous or intermittent red and dark red tones, spectral edge frequency (SEF) in the delta-theta range, with or without asymmetry and BIS number trend with significant variability. In contrast, CDSA during sedation revealed predominance of orange, yellow, green and occasionally blue tones, SEF in the alpha-beta range, absence of asymmetry and stability of BIS number.
b-BIS monitoring system and, in particular, CDSA used by nonexpert NICU personnel may be helpful to follow-up episodes of NCSE, to detect recurrences of nonconvulsive seizures (NCSzs), and to monitor profound anesthetic therapy in comatose patients when cEEG is not available.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26615579/
26578097,Monitoring sleep depth: analysis of bispectral index (BIS) based on polysomnographic recordings and sleep deprivation.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2017,"Giménez S, Romero S, Alonso JF, Mañanas MÁ, Pujol A, Baxarias P, Antonijoan RM","The assessment and management of sleep are increasingly recommended in the clinical practice. Polysomnography (PSG) is considered the gold standard test to monitor sleep objectively, but some practical and technical constraints exist due to environmental and patient considerations. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is commonly used in clinical practice for guiding anesthetic administration and provides an index based on relationships between EEG components. Due to similarities in EEG synchronization between anesthesia and sleep, several studies have assessed BIS as a sleep monitor with contradictory results. The aim of this study was to evaluate objectively both the feasibility and reliability of BIS for sleep monitoring through a robust methodology, which included full PSG recordings at a baseline situation and after 40 h of sleep deprivation. Results confirmed that the BIS index was highly correlated with the hypnogram (0.89 ± 0.02), showing a progressive decrease as sleep deepened, and an increase during REM sleep (awake: 91.77 ± 8.42; stage N1: 83.95 ± 11.05; stage N2: 71.71 ± 11.99; stage N3: 42.41 ± 9.14; REM: 80.11 ± 8.73). Mean and median BIS values were lower in the post-deprivation night than in the baseline night, showing statistical differences for the slow wave sleep (baseline: 42.41 ± 9.14 vs. post-deprivation: 39.49 ± 10.27; p = 0.02). BIS scores were able to discriminate properly between deep (N3) and light (N1, N2) sleep. BIS values during REM overlapped those of other sleep stages, although EMG activity provided by the BIS monitor could help to identify REM sleep if needed. In conclusion, BIS monitors could provide a useful measure of sleep depth in especially particular situations such as intensive care units, and they could be used as an alternative for sleep monitoring in order to reduce PSG-derived costs and to increase capacity in ambulatory care.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26578097/

Vital signals contain valuable information that can be used in prediction of different levels of anesthesia. Some monitors based on electroencephalogram (EEG) such as the Bispectral (BIS) index have been proposed in recent years. This study proposes a new method for characterizing between awake and anesthetized states. We validated our method by obtaining data from 25 patients during the cardiac surgery that requires cardiopulmonary bypass. At first, some linear and non-linear features are extracted from EEG signals. Then a method called ""LLE""(Locally Linear Embedding) is used to map high-dimensional features in a three-dimensional output space. Finally, low dimensional data are used as an input to a quadratic discriminant analyzer (QDA). The experimental results indicate that an overall accuracy of 88.4 % can be obtained using this method for classifying the EEG signal into conscious and unconscious states for all patients. Considering the reliability of this method, we can develop a new EEG monitoring system that could assist the anesthesiologists to estimate the depth of anesthesia accurately.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26573650/

Totally 63-patient data is addressed, for both modeling and testing of 17 and 46 patients, respectively. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is utilized to purify between the electroencephalography (EEG) signal and the noise. The filtered EEG signal is subsequently extracted to achieve a sample entropy index by every 5-second signal. Then, it is combined with other mean values of vital signs, that is, electromyography (EMG), heart rate (HR), pulse, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and signal quality index (SQI) to evaluate the DoA index as the input. The 5 doctor scores are averaged to obtain an output index. The mean absolute error (MAE) is utilized as the performance evaluation. 10-fold cross-validation is performed in order to generalize the model. The ANN model is compared with the bispectral index (BIS). The results show that the ANN is able to produce lower MAE than BIS. For the correlation coefficient, ANN also has higher value than BIS tested on the 46-patient testing data. Sensitivity analysis and cross-validation method are applied in advance.

During the last two decades theory and technology have been developed in parallel with animal experiments aiming to confirm feasibility of using bioimpedance-based technology for prompt detection of brain damage. Here, for the first time, we show that electrical bioimpedance measurements for left and right hemispheres are significantly different in acute cases of unilateral stroke within 24 hours from onset.
Electrical BIS measurements have been taken in healthy volunteers and patients suffering from acute stroke within 24 hours of onset. BIS measurements have been obtained using SFB7 bioimpedance spectrometer manufactured by Impedimed ltd. and 4-electrode method. Measurement electrodes, current, and voltage have been placed according to 10-20 EEG system obtaining mutual BIS measurements from 4 different channels situated in pairs symmetrically from the midsagittal line. Obtained BIS data has been analyzed, assessing for symmetries and differences regarding healthy control data.
7 out of 10 patients for Side-2-Side comparisons and 8 out 10 for central/lateral comparison presented values outside the range defined by healthy control group. When combined only 1 of 10 patients exhibited values within the healthy range.

In this study, we propose a novel nonlinear method, the permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC) index, which describes the complexity in the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal to quantify the effect of GABAergic anaesthetics on brain activities.We applied the PLZC to two EEG data sets that were recorded under sevoflurane and propofol anaesthesia. The results are compared with traditional mean value-based Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), permutation entropy (PE), composite PE index (CPEI), response entropy (RE), state entropy (SE) and bispectral index (BIS) or SynchFastSlow (SFS, derived from BIS). Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling and prediction probability (Pk) were used to assess the performance of the proposed method for tracking GABAergic anaesthetic concentrations.We found that PLZC correlates closely with the anaesthetic drug effect. When applied in sevoflurane anaesthesia, the coefficient of determination R2 between the PLZC values and the sevoflurane effect site concentrations was (0.90 ± 0.07), mean  ±  standard deviation), and the prediction probability Pk was (0.85 ± 0.04). These values were higher than those for the other indices. While in propofol anaesthesia, the value of R2 between PLZC and the effect site concentrations was (0.89 +/- 0.07), and the Pk was (0.86 +/- 0.28), which were close to those for CPEI but better than those for the others.PLZC based on electroencephalogram signals can be used as a new index to characterize the depth of anaesthesia. This index outperformed LZC, PE, CPEI, RE, SE, and BIS or SFS in tracking drug concentration changes during GABAergic anaesthetics.PLZC is a potentially superior method for applications in intra-operative monitoring.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26536480/

Recently, the neurophysiologically based EEG measures of cortical input (CI) and cortical state (CS) have been shown to be prospective indicators of analgesia/antinociception and hypnosis, respectively. In this study, we compared CI and an alternate measure of CS, the composite cortical state (CCS), with the Bispectral Index (BIS) and another recently developed measure of antinociception, the composite variability index (CVI). CVI is an EEG-derived measure based on a weighted combination of BIS and estimated electromyographic activity. By assessing the relationship between these indices for equivalent levels of hypnosis (as quantified using the BIS) and the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance (as determined by the predicted effect-site concentration of remifentanil), we sought to evaluate whether combining hypnotic and analgesic measures could better predict movement in response to a noxious stimulus than when used alone.
Time series of BIS and CVI indices and the raw EEG from a previously published study were reanalyzed. In our current study, the data from 80 patients, each randomly allocated to a target hypnotic level (BIS 50 or BIS 70) and a target remifentanil level (Remi-0, -2, -4 or -6 ng/mL), were included in the analysis. CCS, CI, BIS, and CVI were calculated or quantified at baseline and at a number of intervals after the application of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale and a subsequent tetanic stimulus. The dependency of the putative measures of antinociception CI and CVI on effect-site concentration of remifentanil was then quantified, together with their relationship to the hypnotic measures CCS and BIS. Finally, statistical clustering methods were used to evaluate the extent to which simple combinations of antinociceptive and hypnotic measures could better detect and predict response to stimulation.
Before stimulation, both CI and CVI differentiated patients who received remifentanil from those who were randomly allocated to the Remi-0 group (CI: Cohen's d = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.83; CVI: Cohen's d = 0.72, 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.88). Strong correlations between BIS and CCS were found (at different periods: 0.55 < R2 < 0.68, P < 0.001). Application of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation stimulus was associated with changes in CI and CCS, whereas, subsequent to the application of both stimuli, changes in all measures were seen. Pairwise combinations of CI and CCS showed higher sensitivity in detecting response to stimulation than CVI and BIS combined (sensitivity [99% confidence interval], 75.8% [52.7%-98.8%] vs 42% [15.4%-68.5%], P = 0.006), with specificity for CI and CCS approaching significance (52% [34.7%-69.3%] vs 24% [9.1%-38.9%], P = 0.0159).

26491464,EEG Signals Analysis Using Multiscale Entropy for Depth of Anesthesia Monitoring during Surgery through Artificial Neural Networks.,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2015,"Liu Q, Chen YF, Fan SZ, Abbod MF, Shieh JS","In order to build a reliable index to monitor the depth of anesthesia (DOA), many algorithms have been proposed in recent years, one of which is sample entropy (SampEn), a commonly used and important tool to measure the regularity of data series. However, SampEn only estimates the complexity of signals on one time scale. In this study, a new approach is introduced using multiscale entropy (MSE) considering the structure information over different time scales. The entropy values over different time scales calculated through MSE are applied as the input data to train an artificial neural network (ANN) model using bispectral index (BIS) or expert assessment of conscious level (EACL) as the target. To test the performance of the new index's sensitivity to artifacts, we compared the results before and after filtration by multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). The new approach via ANN is utilized in real EEG signals collected from 26 patients before and after filtering by MEMD, respectively; the results show that is a higher correlation between index from the proposed approach and the gold standard compared with SampEn. Moreover, the proposed approach is more structurally robust to noise and artifacts which indicates that it can be used for monitoring the DOA more accurately.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26491464/

The Wavelet-based Anesthetic Value for Central Nervous System (WAVCNS) index calculated by this monitor is based on wavelet analysis of a normalized electroencephalogram signal in the γ-frequency band. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of disagreement between the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the WAVCNS index during propofol-based and sevoflurane-based maintenance of general anesthesia in a routine surgical population.
Patients undergoing elective surgery were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive either propofol or sevoflurane for the maintenance of anesthesia and remifentanil in both groups. Anesthesiologists were blinded to monitors in both groups. Discordance between the 2 monitors was assessed by the count of discrepancy in recommendation (DR) (type 1 defined as one parameter <40 and the other >60, or type 2 defined as BIS and WAVCNS values on different sides of a threshold [40 or 60]) and also by the proportion of agreement (P0) between WAVCNS and BIS, obtained every 5 seconds, in 3 categories of index (<40, 40-60, and >60).
The analyzed data set consisted of 22 patients (36,872 data pairs) in the propofol group and 24 patients (32,826 data pairs) in the sevoflurane group. The type 1 DR rarely occurred in both the groups (<1%); however, the median (interquartile range) type 2 DR was significantly more frequent in the propofol group (20.6% [7.0-36.9] vs 4.5% [2.3-12.4]; P = 0.0005). The median difference in P0 was 11.53% (95% confidence interval, 0.57-21.32). Major disagreement between WAVCNS index and BIS was related to the weight of burst suppression pattern for the index calculation.
Disagreement between BIS and NeuroSENSE during the maintenance of general anesthesia was worse in the propofol group than that in the sevoflurane groups. The disagreement increases during deep anesthesia or in the occurrence of burst suppression.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26489054/

The syndrome characterised by psychosis, seizures, sleep disorders, hallucinations and short-term memory loss. Ovarian teratoma is the confirmed tumour associated with anti-NMDAR antibodies. The patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis complicated by ovarian teratoma require surgical treatment under general anesthesia. NMDARs are important targets of many anesthetic drugs. The perioperative management and complications of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, including hypoventilation, paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) and epilepsy, are challenging for ansthesiologists.
This report described two female patients who presented for resection of the ovarian teratoma, they had confirmed anti-NMDAR encephalitis accompanied by ovarian teratoma. Two patients received gamma globulin treatments and the resection of the ovarian teratoma under total intravenous anesthesia. They were recovered and discharged on the 20(th) and 46(th) postoperative day respectively.
There is insufficient evidence about the perioperative management, monitoring and anesthesia management of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. This report was based on the consideration that controversial anesthetics that likely act on NMDARs should be avoided. Additionally, BIS monitoring should to be prudently applied in anti-NMDAR encephalitis because of abnormal electric encephalography (EEG). Anesthesiologists must be careful with regard to central ventilation dysfunctions and PSH due to anti-NMDAR encephalitis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26475263/

Different synchronization measures have their own properties to reflect the changes of EEG activities during different anesthetic states. However, the performance characteristics and the relations of different synchronization measures in evaluating synchronization changes during propofol-induced anesthesia are not fully elucidated. Two-channel EEG data from seven volunteers who had undergone a brief standardized propofol anesthesia were then adopted to calculate eight synchronization indexes. We computed the prediction probability (P K ) of synchronization indexes with Bispectral Index (BIS) and propofol effect-site concentration (C eff ) to quantify the ability of the indexes to predict BIS and C eff . Also, box plots and coefficient of variation were used to reflect the different synchronization changes and their robustness to noise in awake, unconscious and recovery states, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was used for assessing the relationship among synchronization measures, BIS and C eff . Permutation cross mutual information (PCMI) and determinism (DET) could predict BIS and follow C eff better than nonlinear interdependence (NI), mutual information based on kernel estimation (KerMI) and cross correlation. Wavelet transform coherence (WTC) in α and β frequency bands followed BIS and C eff better than that in other frequency bands. There was a significant decrease in unconscious state and a significant increase in recovery state for PCMI and NI, while the trends were opposite for KerMI, DET and WTC. Phase synchronization based on phase locking value (PSPLV) in δ, θ, α and γ1 frequency bands dropped significantly in unconscious state, whereas it had no significant synchronization in recovery state. Moreover, PCMI, NI, DET correlated closely with each other and they had a better robustness to noise and higher correlation with BIS and C eff than other synchronization indexes. Propofol caused EEG synchronization changes during the anesthetic period. Different synchronization measures had individual properties in evaluating synchronization changes in different anesthetic states, which might be related to various forms of neural activities and neurophysiological mechanisms under general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26350675/

The current experiment tested the hypothesis that exercising self-control temporarily increases approach motivation, as revealed by patterns of electrical activity in the prefrontal cortex. Participants completed a writing task that did vs did not require them to exercise self-control. Then they viewed pictures known to evoke positive, negative or neutral affect. We assessed electroencephalographic (EEG) activity while participants viewed the pictures, and participants reported their trait levels of behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and behavioral activation system (BAS) sensitivity at the end of the study. We found that exercising (vs not exercising) self-control increased relative left frontal cortical activity during picture viewing, particularly among individuals with relatively higher BAS than BIS, and particularly during positive picture viewing. A similar but weaker pattern emerged during negative picture viewing.

A 13-year-old child weighing 32kg, suffering from lobar holoprosencephaly, underwent surgery in which the bispectral index (BIS) monitoring the depth of anesthesia showed an abnormal response. Detailed analysis of the trends of BIS values in the different observation times demonstrated sudden falls and repetitive values of BIS likely related to repetitive epileptiform electrical activity caused by sevoflurane.
The BIS is a very useful monitoring tool for assessing the degree of depth of anesthesia and to analyze the electroencephalographic variations of anesthetics.

However, during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), factors other than the administered hypnotic agents may influence EEG signals, and their effects on BIS values are unknown.
This report is a secondary analysis of data from a prospective, controlled interventional study comparing the effect of sevoflurane administration guided by BIS monitoring (group SevoBIS) and constant administration of sevoflurane (group Sevo1.8Vol%) during CPB. Sevoflurane plasma concentration (SPC) was measured using gas chromatography. The relationships of BIS to SPC, CPB pump flow, arterial pressure, hematocrit, temperature, time on CPB, and patient characteristics were analysed.
No association was observed between BIS values and SPC in group SevoBIS. In group Sevo1.8Vol%, a 40 μg ml-1 increase in SPC, which encompassed the entire range of observed values of the SPC in this analysis, was associated with a decrease of 3.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-6.1) in BIS values (p = 0.005). Each increase in CPB time of 10 minutes was associated with an increase in BIS values of 0.25 (95%CI: 0.11-0.39, p<0.001). Path analysis revealed that the BIS values of SevoBIS patients were 5.3 (95%CI: 3.2-7.5) units higher than those of Sevo1.8Vol% patients (p<0.001), which was the strongest effect on BIS values. Path analysis revealed a slope of 0.5 (95%CI: 0.3-0.7) BIS units per 1°C body temperature (p<0.001).

26174308,Response of bispectral index to neuromuscular block in awake volunteers.,British journal of anaesthesia,2015,"Schuller PJ, Newell S, Strickland PA, Barry JJ","The bispectral index (BIS) monitor is a quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) device that is widely used to assess the hypnotic component of anaesthesia, especially when neuromuscular blocking drugs are used. It has been shown that the BIS is sensitive to changes in electromyogram (EMG) activity in anaesthetized patients. A single study using an earlier version of the BIS showed that decreased EMG activity caused the BIS to decrease even in awake subjects, to levels that suggested deep sedation and anaesthesia.
We administered suxamethonium and rocuronium to 10 volunteers who were fully awake, to determine whether the BIS decreased in response to neuromuscular block alone. An isolated forearm technique was used for communication during the experiment. Two versions of the BIS monitor were used, both of which are in current use. Sugammadex was used to antagonise the neuromuscular block attributable to rocuronium.
The BIS decreased after the onset of neuromuscular block in both monitors, to values as low as 44 and 47, and did not return to pre-test levels until after the return of movement. The BIS showed a two-stage decrease, with an immediate reduction to values around 80, and then several minutes later, a sharp decrease to lower values. In some subjects, there were periods where the BIS was <60 for several minutes. The response was similar for both suxamethonium and rocuronium. Neither monitor was consistently superior in reporting the true state of awareness.
These results suggest that the BIS monitor requires muscle activity, in addition to an awake EEG, in order to generate values indicating that the subject is awake. Consequently, BIS may be an unreliable indicator of awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking drugs.

26174297,Changes in the electroencephalogram during anaesthesia and their physiological basis.,British journal of anaesthesia,2015,Hagihira S,"The use of EEG monitors to assess the level of hypnosis during anaesthesia has become widespread. Anaesthetists, however, do not usually observe the raw EEG data: they generally pay attention only to the Bispectral Index (BIS™) and other indices calculated by EEG monitors. This abstracted information only partially characterizes EEG features. To properly appreciate the availability and reliability of EEG-derived indices, it is necessary to understand how raw EEG changes during anaesthesia. With hemi-frontal lead EEGs obtained under volatile anaesthesia or propofol anaesthesia, the dominant EEG frequency decreases and the amplitude increases with increasing concentrations of anaesthetic. Looking more closely, the EEG changes are more complicated. At surgical concentrations of anaesthesia, spindle waves (alpha range) become dominant. At deeper levels, this activity decreases, and theta and delta waves predominate. At even deeper levels, EEG waveform changes into a burst and suppression pattern, and finally becomes flat. EEG waveforms vary in the presence of noxious stimuli (surgical skin incision), which is not always reflected in BIS™, or other processed EEG indices. Spindle waves are adequately sensitive, however, to noxious stimuli: under surgical anaesthesia they disappear when noxious stimuli are applied, and reappear when adequate analgesia is obtained. To prevent awareness during anaesthesia, I speculate that the most effective strategy is to administer anaesthetic agents in such a way as to maintain anaesthesia at a level where spindle waves predominate.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26174297/

Previously, no attempt had been made to discover which EEG characteristics cause discrepancies between BIS and Entropy. We compared BIS and Entropy values, and analysed the changes in the raw EEG signal during surgical anaesthesia with sevoflurane.
In this prospective, open-label study, 65 patients receiving general anaesthesia with sevoflurane were enrolled. BIS, Entropy and multichannel digital EEG were recorded. Concurrent BIS and State Entropy (SE) values were selected. Whenever BIS and SE values showed ≥10-unit disagreement for ≥60 s, the raw EEG signal was analysed both in time and frequency domain.
A ≥10-unit disagreement ≥60 s was detected 428 times in 51 patients. These 428 episodes accounted for 5158 (11%) out of 45 918 analysed index pairs. During EEG burst suppression, SE was higher than BIS in 35 out of 49 episodes. During delta-theta dominance, BIS was higher than SE in 141 out of 157 episodes. During alpha or beta activity, SE was higher than BIS in all 49 episodes. During electrocautery, both BIS and SE changed, sometimes in the opposite direction, but returned to baseline values after electrocautery. Electromyography caused index disagreement four times (BIS > SE).
Certain specific EEG patterns, and artifacts, are associated with discrepancies between BIS and SE. Time and frequency domain analyses of the original EEG improve the interpretation of studies involving BIS, Entropy and other EEG-based indices.

Bilateral Bispectral Index (BIS)-monitoring was applied during the pre-, intra- and postoperative period, and BIS, EEG Asymmetry (ASYM), and Burst Suppression Ratio (BSR) were recorded. POD was diagnosed according to the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit, and patients were divided into a delirium and non-delirium group.
POD was detected in 26 patients (32%). A trend towards a lower ASYM was observed in the delirium group as compared to the non-delirium group on the preoperative day (ASYM = 48.2 ± 3.6% versus 50.0 ± 4.7%, mean ± sd, p = 0.087) as well as before induction of anaesthesia, with oral midazolam anxiolysis (median ASYM = 49.5%, IQR [47.4;51.5] versus 50.6%, IQR [49.1;54.2], p = 0.081). Delirious patients remained significantly (p = 0.018) longer in a burst suppression state intraoperatively (107 minutes, IQR [47;170] versus 44 minutes, IQR [11;120]) than non-delirious patients. Receiver operating analysis revealed burst suppression duration (area under the curve = 0.73, p = 0.001) and BSR (AUC = 0.68, p = 0.009) as predictors of POD.
Intraoperative assessment of BSR may identify patients at risk of POD and should be investigated in further studies. So far it remains unknown whether there is a causal relationship or rather an association between intraoperative burst suppression and the development of POD.

Participants scored the perceived pain intensity at the end of PAIN and AN. The EEG midline dynamics was characterized by indices indicating the signal predictability (Determinism) and complexity (Entropy) obtained through the Recurrence Quantification Analysis. The reduced pain intensity reported by highs during AN was partially accounted for by the activity of the Behavioral Activation System. The decreased midline cortical Determinism observed during nociceptive stimulation in both groups independently of suggestions remained significantly reduced only in lows after controlling for the activity of the Behavioral Activation System. Finally, controlling for the activity of the Behavioral Inhibition System abolished stimulation, suggestions and hypnotizability-related differences.

The most common techniques used to evaluate these changes include electroencepalography (EEG) and evoked potentials. In animals, EEGs immediately following TBI can show either diffuse slowing or voltage attenuation, or high voltage spiking. Following a TBI, many animals display evidence of hippocampal excitability and a reduced seizure threshold. Some mice subjected to severe TBI via a fluid percussion injury will eventually develop seizures, which provides a useful potential model for studying the neurophysiology of epileptogenesis. In humans, the EEG changes associated with mild TBI are relatively subtle and may be challenging to distinguish from EEG changes seen in other conditions. Quantitative EEG (QEEG) may enhance the ability to detect post-traumatic electrophysiologic changes following a mild TBI. Some types of evoked potential (EP) and event related potential (ERP) can also be used to detect post-traumatic changes following a mild TBI. Continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG) following moderate and severe TBI is useful in detecting the presence of seizures and status epilepticus acutely following an injury, although some seizures may only be detectable using intracranial monitoring. CEEG can also be helpful for assessing prognosis after moderate or severe TBI. EPs, particularly somatosensory evoked potentials, can also be useful in assessing prognosis following severe TBI.

This study seeks to answer the question: ""To what degree can EEG suppression and burst count as measured by diagnostic EEG during drug-induced coma be predicted from data obtained from the BIS such as BIS value, suppression ratio (SR), and burst count?""
During drug-induced coma, cortical EEG is the gold standard for real-time monitoring and drug titration. Diagnostic EEG is, from setup through data analysis, labor intensive, costly, and difficult to maintain uniform clinician competency. BIS monitoring is less expensive, less labor-intensive, and easier to interpret data and establish/maintain competency. Validating BIS data versus diagnostic EEG facilitates effective brain monitoring during drug-induced coma at lower cost with similar outcomes.
This is a prospective, observational cohort study. Four consecutive patients receiving drug-induced coma/EEG monitoring were enrolled. BIS was initiated after informed consent. Variables recorded per minute included presence or absence of EEG burst suppression, burst count, BIS value over time, burst count, and SR. Pearson's product-moment and Spearman rank coefficient for BIS value and SR versus burst count were performed. Regression analysis was utilized to plot BIS values versus bursts/minute on EEG as well as SR versus burst count on EEG. EEG/BIS data were collected from digital data files and transcribed onto data sheets for corresponding time indices.
Four patients yielded 1,972 data sets over 33 hours of EEG/BIS monitoring. Regression coefficient of 0.6673 shows robust predictive value between EEG burst count and BIS SR. Spearman rank coefficient of -0.8727 indicates strong inverse correlation between EEG burst count and BIS SR. Pearson's correlation coefficient between EEG versus BIS burst count was .8256 indicating strong positive correlation. Spearman's rank coefficient of 0.8810 and Pearson's correlation coefficient of .6819 showed strong correlation between BIS value versus EEG burst count. Number of patients (4) limits available statistics and ability to generalize results. Graphs and statistics show strong correlation/predictive value for BIS parameters to EEG suppression.
This study is the first to measure correlation and predictive value between BIS monitoring and diagnostic EEG for degree of EEG suppression and burst count in the adult population. Available statistic tests and graphing of variables from BIS and diagnostic EEG show strong correlation and predictive value between both monitoring technologies during drug-induced coma.

Reinforcement sensitivity may shape motives for nicotine use and offer potential targets for personalized smoking cessation therapy. However, little is known regarding how reinforcement sensitivity is related to motivational processes implicated in the maintenance of smoking. Additionally, women and men differ in reinforcement sensitivity, and such difference may cause distinct relationships between reinforcement sensitivity and motivational processes for female and male smokers. In this study, the authors characterized reinforcement sensitivity in relation to affect, smoking-related reinforcement motives, and affective responses, using self-report and psychophysiological measures, in over 200 smokers before treating them. The Behavioral Inhibition/Activation Scales (BIS/BAS; Carver & White, 1994) was used to measure reinforcement sensitivity. In female and male smokers, BIS was similarly associated with negative affect and negative reinforcement of smoking. However, positive affect was positively associated with BAS Drive scores in male smokers, and this association was reversed in female smokers. BIS was positively associated with corrugator electromyographic reactivity toward negative stimuli and left frontal electroencephalogram alpha asymmetry. Female and male smokers showed similar relationships for these physiological measures. These findings suggest that reinforcement sensitivity underpins important motivational processes (e.g., affect), and gender is a moderating factor for these relationships. Future personalized smoking intervention, particularly among more dependent treatment-seeking smokers, may experiment to target individual differences in reinforcement sensitivity.

Annual International Conference,2014,"Kim J, Hyub H, Yoon SZ, Choi HJ, Kim KM, Park SH","Real-time quantification of the patient's consciousness level during anesthesia is an important issue to avoid intraoperative awareness and post-operative side effects. A depth-of-anesthesia (DoA) monitoring method called Bispectral Index (BIS) is generally used for this purpose. However, BIS is known to be inaccurate at the transitory state, and also shows a critical time delay in quantifying the patient's consciousness level. This paper introduces a novel method to reduce the response time in the quantification process. This thesis develops a new index called HDoA by analyzing EEG using Hidden Markov Model. The proposed approach is composed by two steps, training and testing. In the training step, two HMM, awakened and anesthetized model are learned based on each training set. In the testing step, by evaluating the probability of producing the testing EEG from two models respectively, the index HDoA is derived. Since the evaluation of DoA using HMM is training based method, it have better performance with more training process. Experiments show that HDoA has a high correlation with BIS at a steady state, and outperforms BIS in two ways: (1) shorter delay time in transition state, and (2) higher Fisher Score. The validity of HDoA has been tested by 8 real clinical data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25571010/

So far, it is not known to what extent different devices display similar index values while processing identical electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.
To compare BIS and state entropy during analysis of identical EEG data. Inspection of raw EEG input to detect potential causes of erroneous index calculation.
Offline re-analysis of EEG data from a randomised, single-centre controlled trial using the Entropy Module and an Aspect A-2000 monitor.
Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universität München, Munich.
Forty adult patients undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia.
Blocked randomisation of 20 patients per anaesthetic group (sevoflurane/remifentanil or propofol/remifentanil). Isolated forearm technique for differentiation between consciousness and unconsciousness.
Prediction probability (PK) of state entropy to discriminate consciousness from unconsciousness. Correlation and agreement between state entropy and BIS from deep to light hypnosis. Analysis of raw EEG compared with index values that are in conflict with clinical examination, with frequency measures (frequency bands/Spectral Edge Frequency 95) and visual inspection for physiological EEG patterns (e.g. beta or delta arousal), pathophysiological features such as high-frequency signals (electromyogram/high-frequency EEG or eye fluttering/saccades), different types of electro-oculogram or epileptiform EEG and technical artefacts.
PK of state entropy was 0.80 and of BIS 0.84; correlation coefficient of state entropy with BIS 0.78. Nine percent BIS and 14% state entropy values disagreed with clinical examination. Highest incidence of disagreement occurred after state transitions, in particular for state entropy after loss of consciousness during sevoflurane anaesthesia. EEG sequences which led to false 'conscious' index values often showed high-frequency signals and eye blinks. High-frequency EEG/electromyogram signals were pooled because a separation into EEG and fast electro-oculogram, for example eye fluttering or saccades, on the basis of a single EEG channel may not be very reliable. These signals led to higher Spectral Edge Frequency 95 and ratio of relative beta and gamma band power than EEG signals, indicating adequate unconscious classification. The frequency of other artefacts that were assignable, for example technical artefacts, movement artefacts, was negligible and they were excluded from analysis.
High-frequency signals and eye blinks may account for index values that falsely indicate consciousness. Compared with BIS, state entropy showed more false classifications of the clinical state at transition between consciousness and unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25564779/
25481665,The functional role of individual-alpha based frontal asymmetry in stress responding.,Biological psychology,2015,"Quaedflieg CW, Meyer T, Smulders FT, Smeets T","Asymmetry in frontal electrical activity has been suggested to index tendencies in affective responding and thus may be associated with hormonal stress responses. To assess the functional role of frontal asymmetry (FA) in stress, we measured FA at rest and following exposure to acute stress induced with the Maastricht Acute Stress Task (MAST; N=70) in the standard 8-13Hz band as well as based on individual alpha frequency (IAF) band. IAF-based resting FAF4-F3 was associated with the stress-induced neuroendocrine response, such that left individual frontal activity predicted smaller total cortisol increases in response to the MAST. Like previous studies, we found resting left-sided FAF8-F7 to predict trait behavioural activation measured with the BIS/BAS scales. FA remained unaffected by stress-induced cortisol response. These findings suggest that individual FA might reflect a trait-like characteristic that moderates the stress response. Our results underscore the utility of IAF in studying individual differences in stress responding.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25481665/

The association between anesthesia depth and presurgery physical and health status, however, is currently debated. Depression is one comorbid condition that warrants investigation given its association to reduced frontal lobe activity and high prevalence in known surgery samples (e.g., gynecologic mass removal).
This pilot study examined the hypothesis that severity of acute depressive symptoms would associate with greater sensitivity to anesthesia as measured by a frontal lobe electroencephalogram (EEG)-based monitor during the anesthesia induction phase among women undergoing gynecologic mass removal.
This was a prospective and surgery anesthesia-controlled pilot investigation with 31 women undergoing surgery for removal of pelvic/gynecologic masses. Participants completed the Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (MBMD) inventory to assess depressive-related symptomatology. A Bispectral Index Score (BIS™) monitor (Aspect Medical Systems Inc., MA) was placed on the left frontal region to measure change in response from a set pre-anesthesia baseline point throughout the induction phase (6.5 min of the anesthetic). BIS™ change was calculated using a modified ""area under the curve with respect to ground"" formula.
Greater sensitivity to anesthesia during induction was significantly associated with higher MBMD future pessimism scores and marginally associated with higher MBMD depression scores. Depressive personality, anxiety severity, tumor type, age, medication use, and comorbidity scores were not found to be predictors of BIS score change.
These pilot findings suggest that preoperative psychological health and anesthesia response are not independent. Acute presurgery depression and anesthesia response warrant closer empirical examination.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25421878/

The new method uses a combination of phase and amplitude of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to assess the DoA level. A strong analytical signal transform is applied to extract the phase and amplitude information of the recorded EEG signals. Based on the extracted features from the EEG signal in each different frequency band, a new DoA index is developed. The proposed new DoA index is evaluated using data from adult patients in an age range from 22 to 75 years. The results show that the new DoA index is able to detect the changing pattern of EEG signals early and agree with the clinical notes of an attending anaesthetist. The results are also closely correlated with the popular BIS index. Furthermore, the proposed new DoA index is able to detect the state changes earlier than the BIS index.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25412884/

This electroencephalography (EEG) study examined the well-established motivational direction model of asymmetric frontal brain activity in schizophrenia. According to this model, relative left frontal activity in the resting EEG reflects enhanced approach motivation tendencies, whereas relative right frontal activity reflects enhanced withdrawal motivation tendencies. Twenty-five schizophrenia outpatients and 25 healthy controls completed resting EEG assessments of frontal asymmetry in the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz), as well as a self-report measure of behavioral activation and inhibition system (BIS/BAS) sensitivity. Patients showed an atypical pattern of differences from controls. On the EEG measure patients failed to show the left lateralized activity that was present in controls, suggesting diminished approach motivation. On the self-report measure, patients reported higher BIS sensitivity than controls, which is typically interpreted as heightened withdrawal motivation. EEG asymmetry scores did not significantly correlate with BIS/BAS scores or with clinical symptom ratings among patients. The overall pattern suggests a motivational disturbance in schizophrenia characterized by elements of both diminished approach and elevated withdrawal tendencies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25310340/

Monitoring depth of anesthesia is a fundamental solution to this problem. The induction of anesthesia alters frequency and mean of amplitudes of the electroencephalogram (EEG), and its phase couplings. We analyzed EEG changes for phase coupling between delta and alpha subbands using a new algorithm for depth of general anesthesia measurement based on complex wavelet transform (CWT) in patients anesthetized by Propofol. Entropy and histogram of modulated signals were calculated by taking bispectral index (BIS) values as reference. Entropies corresponding to different BIS intervals using Mann-Whitney U test showed that they had different continuous distributions. The results demonstrated that there is a phase coupling between 3 and 4 Hz in delta and 8-9 Hz in alpha subbands and these changes are shown better at the channel T 7 of EEG. Moreover, when BIS values increase, the entropy value of modulated signal also increases and vice versa. In addition, measuring phase coupling between delta and alpha subbands of EEG signals through continuous CWT analysis reveals the depth of anesthesia level. As a result, awareness during anesthesia can be prevented.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25276220/

In this prospective observational study in adult comatose patients treated by therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest we measured bispectral index (BIS) during the first 24 hours of intensive care unit stay. A blinded neurological outcome assessment by cerebral performance category (CPC) was done 6 months after cardiac arrest.
Forty-six patients (48%) had a good neurological outcome at 6-month, as defined by a cerebral performance category (CPC) 1-2, and 50 patients (52%) had a poor neurological outcome (CPC 3-5). Over the 24h of monitoring, mean BIS values over time were higher in the good outcome group (38 ± 9) compared to the poor outcome group (17 ± 12) (p<0.001). Analysis of BIS recorded every 30 minutes provided an optimal prediction after 12.5h, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.89, a specificity of 89% and a sensitivity of 86% using a cut-off value of 23. With a specificity fixed at 100% (sensitivity 26%) the cut-off BIS value was 2.4 over the first 271 minutes. In multivariable analyses including clinical characteristics, mean BIS value over the first 12.5h was a predictor of neurological outcome (p = 6E-6) and provided a continuous net reclassification index of 1.28% (p = 4E-10) and an integrated discrimination improvement of 0.31 (p=1E-10).

We sought to examine whether the incidence of cerebral oxygen desaturation in elderly patients (≥68 years of age) undergoing spine surgery in the prone position was more common than patients undergoing major surgery in the supine position.
We performed a retrospective cohort study of 205 patients; 63 patients underwent surgery in the prone position and 142 in the supine position. Patients were evaluated for cerebral desaturation with bilateral cerebral oximetry. The primary predictor was position, secondary were: length of the surgery, incidence and duration of cerebral desaturation episodes at several thresholds, average time of Bispectral index below threshold of 45 in minutes, average electroencephalogram suppression ratio >0, amount of blood transfused, and the incidence of hypotension and hypertension.
Elderly spine surgery patients in the prone position were more than twice as likely to experience mild cerebral desaturation as patients in the supine position. Patients in the prone position had longer surgeries; however cerebral desaturation in the prone position was significantly more common even when adjusted for surgery time and the occurrence of intraoperative hypotension.
Cerebral desaturation is related to the prone position in elderly surgery patients. Future studies are necessary to determine whether this translates to a higher incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25216265/

We used order patterns cross recurrence plot and provide an index named order pattern laminarity (OPL) to assess changes in neuronal synchronization as the mechanism forming the foundation of conscious perception. The prediction probability of 0.9 and 0.84 for OPL and BIS specified that the OPL index correlated more strongly with effect-site propofol concentration. Also, our new index makes faster reaction to transients in EEG recordings based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model parameters and demonstrates less variability at the point of loss of consciousness (standard deviation of 0.04 for OPL compared with 0.09 for BIS index).

Both indices are derived from the frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) and implemented in the qCON 2000 monitor (Quantium Medical, Barcelona, Spain).
The study was approved by the local ethics committee, including data from 60 patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery undergoing general anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil, using TCI. The Bis (Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA) was recorded simultaneously with the qCON. Loss of eyelash reflex [loss of consciousness (LOC)] was recorded, and prediction probability for Bis and qCON was calculated. Movement as a response to noxious stimulation [laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation] was registered. The correlation coefficient between qCON and Bis was calculated. The patients were divided into movers/non-movers as a response to noxious stimulation. A paired t-test was used to assess significant difference for qCON and qNOX for movers/non-movers.
The prediction probability (Pk) and the standard error (SE) for qCON and Bis for detecting LOC was 0.92 (0.02) and 0.94 (0.02) respectively (t-test, no significant difference). The R between qCON and Bis was 0.85. During the general anaesthesia (Ce propofol > 2 μg/ml, Ce remifentanil > 2 ng/ml), the mean value and standard deviation (SD) for qCON was 45 (8), while for qNOX it was 40 (6). The qNOX pre-stimuli values were significantly different (P < 0.05) for movers/non-movers as a response to LMA insertion [62.5 (24.0) vs. 45.5 (24.1)], tracheal intubation [58.7 (21.8) vs. 41.4 (20.9)], laryngoscopy [54.1 (21.4) vs. 41.0 (20.8)]. There were no significant differences in remifentanil or propofol effect-site concentrations for movers vs. non-movers.
The qCON was able to reliably detect LOC during general anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil.

Ideally, the incorporation of brain monitoring into routine practice would promote the maintenance of an optimal depth of anaesthesia, with an ultimate goal of avoiding the negative outcomes that have been associated with inadequate or excessive anaesthesia. A variety of processed electroencephalogram devices exist, of which the bispectral index is the most widely used, particularly in the research setting. Whether such devices prove to be useful will depend not only on their ability to influence anaesthetic management but also on whether the changes they promote can actually affect clinically important outcomes.

We studied the relationships between these indices, level of hypnosis (BIS level), and antinociception (predicted remifentanil effect-site concentrations, CeREMI) before and after stimulation. Also, we measured their association with movement in response to a noxious stimulus.
We randomized 120 patients to one of 12 groups targeting different hypnotic levels (BIS 70, 50, and 30) and various CeREMI (0, 2, 4, or 6 ng/mL). At pseudo-steady state, baseline values were observed, and a series of stimuli were applied. Changes in BIS, CVI, heart rate (HR), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) between baseline and response period were analyzed in relation to level of hypnosis, antinociception, and somatic response to the stimuli.
CVI and BIS more accurately correlate with somatic response to an Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation-noxious stimulation than HR, MAP, CeREMI, and propofol effect-site concentration (Tukey post hoc tests P < 0.01). Change in CVI is more adequate to monitor response to stimulation than changes in BIS, HR, or MAP (as described by the Mathews Correlation Coefficient with significance level set at P < 0.001). In contrast, none of the candidate analgesic state indices was uniquely related to a specific opioid concentration and is extensively influenced by the hypnotic state as measured by BIS.

A cohort was defined with >5 cumulative minutes of EEG suppression, and 1:2 propensity-matched to a non-suppressed cohort (≤5 min suppression). We evaluated the association between EEG suppression and mortality using multivariable logistic regression, and examined risk factors for EEG suppression using zero-inflated mixed effects analysis.
Ninety day postoperative mortality was 3.9% overall, 6.3% in the suppressed cohort, and 3.0% in the non-suppressed cohort {odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]=2.19 (1.48-3.26)}. After matching and multivariable adjustment, EEG suppression was not associated with mortality [OR (95% CI)=0.83 (0.55-1.25)]; however, the interaction between EEG suppression and mean arterial pressure (MAP) <55 mm Hg was [OR (95% CI)=2.96 (1.34-6.52)]. Risk factors for EEG suppression were older age, number of comorbidities, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and higher intraoperative doses of benzodiazepines, opioids, or volatile anaesthetics. EEG suppression was less likely in patients with cancer, preoperative alcohol, opioid or benzodiazepine consumption, and intraoperative nitrous oxide exposure.
Although EEG suppression was associated with increasing anaesthetic administration and comorbidities, the hypothesis that intraoperative EEG suppression is a predictor of postoperative mortality was only supported if it was coincident with low MAP.

We evaluated the performance of a triage model based on early bispectral index (BIS) findings and cardiac risk classes.
Retrospective evaluation of serial patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, unable to follow commands, and undergoing hypothermia. Patients were assigned to a cardiac risk group: STEMI, VT/VF shock, VT/VF no shock, or PEA/asystole, and to a neurological dysfunction group, based on the BIS score following first neuromuscular blockade (BISi), and classified as BISi>20, BISi 10-20, or BISi<10. Cause of death was described as neurological or circulatory.
BISi in 171 patients was measured at 267(±177)min after resuscitation and 35(±1.7)°C.

The mean of the median BIS/SE values for each patient during the maintenance phase of anesthesia in the low and high groups was significantly different: 39 vs 48 (mean difference 8 [95% confidence interval {CI95}, 6 to 10], P < 0.001). There was also a significant difference in mean volatile anesthetic administration (minimum alveolar concentration): 0.98 vs 0.64 (mean difference -0.35 [CI95, -0.44 to -0.26], P < 0.001) and target propofol concentrations: 4.0 vs 3.1 μg/mL (mean difference -0.8 [CI95, -1.2 to -0.3], P = 0.004). Intraoperative mean arterial blood pressures were similar (85 vs 87 mm Hg; mean difference 2 [CI95, -2 to 6], P = 0.86), and there were no differences in short-term recovery characteristics or hospital length of stay. There was a significant difference in the incidence of wound infection at 30 days (13% vs 3%; risk difference -10% [CI95, -21 to -0.1], P = 0.04). At 1 year, the composite rates of complications in the low and high groups were 28% and 17% (risk difference -11 [CI95, -25 to 4], P = 0.15) and mortality rates were 12% and 9%, respectively (risk difference -2 [CI95, -14 to 9], P = 0.70).
This pilot study demonstrated that depth of anesthesia targeting with BIS or SE was achievable in a high-risk population with adequate separation of processed electroencephalogram monitor targets. The expected incidence of postoperative complications and mortality occurred. We conclude that a large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial is feasible.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24781568/

Today, electroencephalogram-based monitors promise a more specific assessment of the brain function. To date, most approaches were focused on a ""head-to-head"" comparison of either electroencephalogram- or standard parameter-based monitoring. In the current study, a multimodal indicator based on a combination of both electro encephalographic and standard anesthesia monitoring parameters is defined for quantification of ""anesthesia depth.""
Two hundred sixty-three adult patients from six European centers undergoing surgery with general anesthesia were assigned to 1 of 10 anesthetic combinations according to standards of the enrolling hospital. The anesthesia multimodal index of consciousness was developed using a data-driven approach, which maps standard monitoring and electroencephalographic parameters into an output indicator that separates different levels of anesthesia from awake to electroencephalographic burst suppression. Obtained results were compared with either a combination of standard monitoring parameters or the electroencephalogram-based bispectral index.
The anesthesia multimodal index of consciousness showed prediction probability (P(K)) of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.97) to separate different levels of anesthesia (wakefulness to burst suppression), whereas the bispectral index had significantly lower PK of 0.80 (0.76 to 0.81) at corrected threshold P value of less than 0.05. At the transition between consciousness and unconsciousness, anesthesia multimodal index of consciousness yielded a PK of 0.88 (0.85 to 0.91).
A multimodal integration of both standard monitoring and electroencephalographic parameters may more precisely reflect the level of anesthesia compared with monitoring based on one of these aspects alone.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24694845/

Bispectral index (BIS) monitor the cortical activity by fronto-temporal electrodes and is currently used for monitoring level of conscious on sedo-analgesia patients. Some studies have shown certain sensibility to detect cerebrovascular events during carotid revascularization. We aimed to evaluate the impact of BIS monitoring before and shortly after reperfusion on early and delayed clinical improvement on stroke patients.
Consecutive patients with acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke who received reperfusion therapies were monitored with bicortical BIS during the first 6 hours of admission. We registered initial and final BIS value on the affected and contralateral side and determined asymmetry and changes in relation to recanalization and other clinical variables as sedation and perprocedure complications. We defined major clinical improvement decrease ≥ 8 points at discharge or 5 day at admission. Infarct volume was measure on 24-hour CT scan. Modified Rankin score at 3 months was evaluated.
A total of 53 patients were monitored with BIS. Median age was 73 years, median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 16. We observed an inverse correlation between final BIS score and NIHSS at discharge (P < .001; r = -.538) and infarct volume at 24 hours (P = .031; r = -.430). A receiver-operator characteristic curve identified a final BIS score of >81 as the value that better predicted further clinical improvement. After adjusting for recanalization, posttreatment NIHSS and age, final BIS emerged as the only independent predictor of clinical improvement(OR 1.21; CI 95%:1.01-1.28; P = .024).

The BIS monitor has been proposed as an objective form of monitoring the level of consciousness in patients undergoing sedation and anaesthesia. It analyses electroencephalogram wave forms and quantifies this information to produce a numerical value of 0-100. To assess its efficacy,this study investigates if BIS correlates with the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale (OAA/S).
50 episodes of intravenous sedation using midazolam were provided for anxious adults. Sedation proceeded in the standard manner but with the addition of BIS monitoring and assessment of the depth of sedation using the OAA/S scoring system.The operator was blinded to the BIS monitor. Information from the BIS monitor and corresponding OAA/S scores were recorded at 5-minute intervals and at clinically significant points, and correlation was tested using Spearman's Rank test.The effect of electromyographic interference (EMG) on the BIS reading was also investigated.
A strong positive correlation was found between BIS and OAA/S.The mean range of BIS values recorded during sedation was 81+8.The BIS value was found to be most accurate at the end point of sedation.

To investigate the relationship between age adjusted Minimal Alveolar Concentration (MAC) multiples and aEEG in children under 2 years of age.
The aEEG, Spectral Edge Frequency 90% (SEF90) and Bispectral Index™ (BIS) were investigated in a prospective study of children <2 years of age. After anesthetic induction, and caudal block administration, EEG data were collected simultaneously with BrainZ BRM2™ and BIS™ monitors. Using a randomized crossover design, children received up to three age adjusted concentrations of sevoflurane: 0.75, 1 and 1.25 MAC. After 15 min of stable anesthetic delivery EEG readings were obtained. Prediction Probability (Pk ) and correlation coefficients were calculated for each EEG parameter.
From 51 children 102 stable anesthetics concentrations were obtained. For all age groups Pk of aEEG to multiple of age adjusted MAC was <0.72 indicating a poor predictive power for aEEG.

The usefulness of bispectral index (BIS) in monitoring human anesthesia is well established. However, the validity of its application remains unproven in laboratory animals. We assessed whether BIS could be used reliably in monitoring the depth of deep anesthesia in 8 New Zealand white rabbits. Experimental baseline anesthesia was maintained with continuous infusion of propofol and administration of isoflurane, both of which were titrated to EEG activity. The rabbits were allocated randomly to receive 3 increasing concentrations of common anesthetic drugs (etomidate, propofol, and isoflurane) aimed to produce burst suppression of EEG activity yielding at least 10 s of sustained EEG silence. Rabbits had a 20-min recovery interval between challenges. Transient cerebral hypoperfusion to produce reversible EEG silence due to ischemia was induced as a fourth challenge, followed by terminal arrest, in each animal. BIS, EEG, and physiologic data were analyzed for each rabbit. We observed stable BIS values in the range of 40 to 60 during the administration of baseline anesthesia. However, as the depth of anesthesia deepened with the anesthetic drug challenges, the BIS value paradoxically increased with increasing doses. The BIS signal quality index declined while the total power decreased. In contrast to these unexpected results, BIS values decreased rapidly to near 0 during terminal arrest, as expected. Therefore, we do not consider BIS to be a useful method for monitoring deep levels of anesthesia in laboratory rabbits.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24411783/

The same identifiability assessment was performed on recently proposed minimally parameterized parsimonious models for both the neuromuscular blockade and the depth of hypnosis. The results show that the majority of the model parameters are identifiable from the available input-output data.

Case report and video-EEG.
A 60-year-old man, who had received a liver transplant due to alcoholic cirrhosis one year ago, was admitted to our intensive care unit due to septic shock. Computed tomography revealed a prostatic abscess as cause of his sepsis. On Day 27, a respiratory infection due to Pseudomona aeruginosa was diagnosed, and treatment with intravenous cefepime (2 g/8 hours) was initiated. On Day 32, his mental status deteriorated and he developed inattention, a reduced level of consciousness, and multifocal and generalised continuous myoclonic jerks. A video-EEG study was compatible with the diagnosis of symptomatic MSE. On Day 35, cefepime was stopped and general anaesthesia with midazolam was started in order to achieve a faster clinical improvement. We used the BIS-Vista™ monitor to guide general anaesthesia and detect potential episodes of NCSE. On Day 40, an EEG confirmed the existence of moderate diffuse encephalopathy. Finally, the patient died as a consequence of severe heart failure.

Severe cognitive impairment can be prevented by dietary treatment; however, residual symptoms may be reported. These residual symptoms appear to overlap a more prevalent childhood disorder: Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, the aetiology of ADHD is a vast contrast to PKU: it seems to arise from a complex combination of genes; and it has a substantial environmental component. We ask whether these two disorders result from two vastly different genotypes that converge on a specific core phenotype that includes similar dysfunctions of Gray's (Gray, 1982) Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS), coupled with other disorder-specific dysfunctions. If so, we believe comparison of the commonalities will allow greater understanding of the neuropsychology of both disorders. We review in detail the aetiology, treatment, neural pathology, cognitive deficits and electrophysiological abnormalities of PKU; and compare this with selected directly matching aspects of ADHD. The biochemical and neural pathologies of PKU and ADHD are quite distinct in their causes and detail; but they result in the disorder in the brain of large amino acid levels, dopamine and white matter that are very similar and could explain the overlap of symptoms within and between the PKU and ADHD spectra. The common deficits affect visual function, motor function, attention, working memory, planning, and inhibition. For each of PKU and ADHD separately, a subset of deficits has been attributed to a primary dysfunction of behavioural inhibition. In the case of ADHD (excluding the inattentive subtype) this has been proposed to involve a specific failure of the BIS; and we suggest that this is also true of PKU. This accounts for a substantial proportion of the parallels in the superficial symptoms of both disorders and we see this as linked to prefrontal, rather than more general, dysfunction of the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24140048/

The aim was to determine the possibility that this weakness in top-down control is reflected in changes in the cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling (CFPAC) in the electroencephalography (EEG).
Nineteen-channel EEGs were recorded from 50 healthy volunteers with their eyes closed before risk-taking propensity was assessed by behavioural measures, the domain-specific risk-taking (DOSPERT) scale and the Barrett impulsiveness scale (BIS). Correlation analyses between the CFPACs and the behavioural measures were performed.
The CFPACs were negatively correlated with the risk-taking DOSPERT and BIS scores in frontal (Fp2) and centro-parietal (C3, C4 and P4) regions. By contrast, the CFPACs were positively correlated with the risk-taking DOSPERT and BIS scores in the right hemisphere (T8 and P8).
We suggest that frequent risk-taking behaviour is closely associated with the reduced interference of the cortical control network on the reward-oriented system. The CFPAC, which reflects the degree of interactions among functional systems, provides information about an individual's risk-taking propensity.
The CFPAC may be a useful neurophysiological indicator of an individual's tendency towards risk-taking behaviours, which thus potentially contributes to evaluating the severity of the psychiatric diseases exhibiting abnormal risk-taking behaviours.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23770089/

Such surgeries offer great benefits to the patient due to faster reconvalescence and less pain as well as faster return to normal life. The HAL-RAR method for haemorrhoid surgery, introduced as early as in 1995 by Dr. Morigan in Japan.
The goal of our study including 137 patients was research of effects of the spinal and general anaesthesia while monitoring the Bispectral Index (BIS) during the surgery. We focused mainly on the need of postoperative analgesia and possibility to discharge patient to home care after the surgery with the above mentioned type of anaesthesia. BIS helped us to monitor the sufficiency of anaesthesia and anaesthetics dosage regulation that was reflected in earlier awakening and faster reconvalescence, as well as saving anaesthetics.
The length of surgery was not affected by the particular type of anaesthetic procedures (25.7 minutes for the general anaesthesia and 30.2 minutes for the spinal anaesthesia). The need for postoperative analgesia was necessary for the period of 240.0 minutes after the completion of surgery for the general anaesthesia and 313.0 minutes for the spinal anaesthesia after the administration of anaesthetics intrathecally.
BIS is a processed EEG parameter measuring the hypnotic effect of hypnotics and sedatives in brain. BIS helps to reduce the use of anaesthetics during anaesthesia. Our results are promising and we continue in the study, monitoring also other possible parameters.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23685420/

Accurate methods to predict outcome after CA are lacking.
Seventy-five patients with CA treated with therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac resuscitation were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and neuron-enriched S100 beta (S100β) were measured 48 h after CA. Bispectral index (BIS) was continuously monitored during the first 48 h after CA. The primary endpoint was neurological outcome, as defined by the cerebral performance category (CPC) at 6-month follow-up: scores 1 or 2 indicated good outcome, and scores 3 to 5, poor outcome. The secondary endpoint was survival.
A total of 46 (61%) patients survived at 6 months and 41 (55%) patients had CPC 1 or 2. Levels of NSE and S100β were higher in patients with poor outcomes compared with patients with good outcomes (4-fold and 10-fold, respectively; p < 0.001). BIS was lower in patients with poor outcomes (10-fold; p < 0.001). NSE, S100β, or BIS alone predicted neurological outcome, with areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) above 0.80. Combined determination of S100β and BIS had an incremental predictive value (AUC: 0.95). S100β improved discriminations based on BIS (p = 0.0008), and BIS improved discriminations based on S100β (p < 10(-5)). Patients with S100β level above 0.03 μg/l and BIS below 5.5 had a 3.6-fold higher risk of poor neurological outcome (p < 0.0001). S100β and BIS predicted 6-month mortality (log-rank statistic: 50.41; p < 0.001).

23419669,Auditory stimuli as a contributor to consciousness while under general anesthesia.,Medical hypotheses,2013,"Thiele RH, Knipper E, Dunn LK, Nemergut EC","The incidence of intraoperative awareness under general anesthesia approaches 1% in high-risk patients. Anesthesiologists commonly utilize processed electroencephalograms (EEG) in order to monitor ""depth"" of anesthesia, the most common of which is the Bispectral Index (BIS). The B-aware and B-Unaware trials, which were designed to test the efficacy of the BIS monitor, noted an auditory component in 16 of 17 confirmed cases of intraoperative awareness. Implicit auditory memory formation has been documented under general anesthesia. Small studies have documented a significant effect of noise on BIS scores during monitored anesthesia care.
Twenty-two patients undergoing general anesthesia received earplugs after the induction of anesthesia. Every ten minutes the earplugs were reinserted or removed. Noise levels were recorded every 0.125 s and both average and maximal BIS scores were recorded every minute. Non-parametric analysis of both populations (with and without earplugs) was performed. A mixed effects model with one degree of freedom (with and without earplugs) was generated to take into account the effect of anesthetic agents on BIS scores.
3009 min of data were recorded. The median and range (25-75%) BIS scores were 39 (29-46) and 39 (28-44) with and without earplugs in place, respectively. Earplugs were associated with lower BIS scores (p=0.0183). The mixed effects model confirmed this relationship (p<0.001). Subgroup analysis of BIS scores in which the potential for awareness existed (maximum BIS>60 in any one minute epoch) showed a 32% reduction in the incidence of maximal BIS scores exceeding 60 (p=0.0012). There was no relationship between ambient noise level and average maximal BIS score (R(2)=0.003).
Our study suggests that earplugs may reduce the incidence of BIS scores >60 in patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia and that auditory stimuli may affect EEG interpretation. Because of the low cost and safety of noise reduction, as well as the catastrophic implications of intraoperative awareness, further studies to explore the effects of auditory stimuli on awareness and anesthesia are warranted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23419669/

We expected that the cAAI was more useful to monitor anesthetic effect of sevoflurane than the BIS and AAI. The present study compared the changes of cAAI, AAI, and BIS in different sevoflurane concentration. Forty-five adult patients were anesthetized with sevoflurane in 50 % nitrous oxide. AAI (AEP version 1.4), cAAI (AEP version 1.6), and BIS (A-2000) were compared (each 15 patients in AAI, cAAI, and BIS groups) before induction, just before and after intubation, at 10 min since sevoflurane was set to 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 %, and after extubation. All three indices decreased significantly before intubation. The cAAI was significantly higher than the AAI at sevoflurane 1.0 and 1.5 %. The AAI and BIS were significantly lower at sevoflurane 2.0 % than those at sevoflurane 1.0 %, but the cAAI did not. The cAAI had the largest and AAI had the smallest inter-individual variation. In sevoflurane-nitrous oxide anesthesia, cAAI was inferior to AAI and BIS to discriminate different anesthetic effect. The cAAI had larger inter-individual variation than the AAI and BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23417600/
23370095,Permutation auto-mutual information of electroencephalogram in anesthesia.,Journal of neural engineering,2013,"Liang Z, Wang Y, Ouyang G, Voss LJ, Sleigh JW, Li X","The dynamic change of brain activity in anesthesia is an interesting topic for clinical doctors and drug designers. To explore the dynamical features of brain activity in anesthesia, a permutation auto-mutual information (PAMI) method is proposed to measure the information coupling of electroencephalogram (EEG) time series obtained in anesthesia.
The PAMI is developed and applied on EEG data collected from 19 patients under sevoflurane anesthesia. The results are compared with the traditional auto-mutual information (AMI), SynchFastSlow (SFS, derived from the BIS index), permutation entropy (PE), composite PE (CPE), response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE). Performance of all indices is assessed by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling and prediction probability.
The PK/PD modeling and prediction probability analysis show that the PAMI index correlates closely with the anesthetic effect. The coefficient of determination R(2) between PAMI values and the sevoflurane effect site concentrations, and the prediction probability Pk are higher in comparison with other indices. The information coupling in EEG series can be applied to indicate the effect of the anesthetic drug sevoflurane on the brain activity as well as other indices. The PAMI of the EEG signals is suggested as a new index to track drug concentration change.
The PAMI is a useful index for analyzing the EEG dynamics during general anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23370095/

This method takes the limiting large-sample normal distribution as posterior inferences to implement the Bayesian paradigm. The maximum a posterior (MAP) is applied to denoise the wavelet coefficients based on a shrinkage function. When the anesthesia states change from awake to light, moderate, and deep anesthesia, the MAP values increase gradually. Based on these changes, a new function B(DoA) is designed to assess the DoA. The new proposed method is evaluated using anesthetized EEG recordings and BIS data from 25 patients. The Bland-Alman plot is used to verify the agreement of B(DoA) and the popular BIS index. A correlation between B(DoA) and BIS was measured using prediction probability P(K). In order to estimate the accuracy of DoA, the effect of sample n and variance τ on the maximum posterior probability is studied. The results show that the new index accurately estimates the patient's hypnotic states. Compared with the BIS index in some cases, the B(DoA) index can estimate the patient's hypnotic state in the case of poor signal quality.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23314762/

The effect of red hair on IV anesthetic requirement remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the propofol concentration in the effect site associated with half maximal electroencephalogram response, Ce50, is at least 50% higher in subjects with red hair.
We modeled the propofol concentration versus electroencephalogram response relationship using a 2-step approach in 29 healthy dark- and red-haired volunteers receiving a propofol infusion to produce loss of consciousness. Bispectral Index (BIS) was the measure of drug effect. The parameters of a 3-compartment pharmacokinetic model were fit to measured arterial propofol concentrations. The relationship between effect-site propofol concentration (Ce) and BIS was characterized using a sigmoid Emax model. Model performance and accuracy of the estimated parameters were evaluated using accepted metrics and bootstrap resampling. The effect of hair color on the Ce50 for BIS response in the final model was assessed using a threshold of 6.63 (P<0.01) in reduction of -2 log likelihood. The influence of body weight on the model was also assessed.
The inclusion of hair color as a model covariate did not improve either the pharmacokinetic or the pharmacodynamic model. A separate analysis for the dark- and red-haired subjects estimated a median (95% confidence interval) Ce50 BIS of 2.71 μg/mL (2.28-3.36 μg/mL) and 2.57 μg/mL (1.68-3.60 μg/mL), respectively.

A unique common neural action of different classes of anxiolytic drugs may provide such a biomarker. In rodents, a reduction in low frequency (4-12 Hz; ""theta"") brain rhythmicity is produced by all anxiolytics (even those lacking panicolytic or antidepressant action) and not by any non-anxiolytics. This rhythmicity is a key property of the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) postulated to be one neural substrate of anxiety. We sought homologous anxiolytic-sensitive changes in human surface EEG rhythmicity.
Thirty-four healthy volunteers in parallel groups were administered double blind single doses of triazolam 0.25mg, buspirone 10mg or placebo 1 hour prior to completing the stop-signal task. Right frontal conflict-specific EEG power (previously shown to correlate with trait anxiety and neuroticism in this task) was extracted as a contrast between trials with balanced approach-avoidance (stop-go) conflict and the average of trials with net approach and net avoidance.
Compared with placebo, both triazolam and buspirone decreased right-frontal, 9-10 Hz, conflict-specific-power.
Only one dose of each of only two classes of anxiolytic and no non-anxiolytics were tested, so additional tests are needed to determine generality.
There is a distinct rhythmic system in humans that is sensitive to both classical/GABAergic and novel/serotonergic anxiolytics. This conflict-specific rhythmicity should provide a biomarker, with a strong pre-clinical neuropsychology, for a novel approach to classifying anxiety disorders.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23261140/

Prospective monocenter observational study in 24 TBI treated with barbiturates: 13 UFI and 11 DI. Simultaneous BIS and EEG was recorded for 1h. Goal of monitoring was a left BIS between 5 and 15. Biases in BIS were considered as clinically relevant if greater than 5. Differences in biases were interpreted from both statistical (Mann-Whitney test) and clinical points of view.
Mean BIS in the two hemispheres remained in the same monitoring range. There were statistic and clinical differences in some values in the two groups of patients (15% of bias greater than I5I in UFI group and 10% in DI group).

After completing the behavioral inhibition system/behavioral approach system (BIS/BAS) scales, participants viewed anger pictures and neutral pictures. BAS predicted larger late positive potentials (LPPs) to anger pictures, but not to neutral pictures. In addition, BAS predicted greater left-frontal asymmetry to anger pictures. Moreover, larger LPPs to anger pictures related to greater left-frontal EEG asymmetry during anger pictures.

Many authorities have suggested that anaesthesiologists using these monitors should interpret the raw EEG waveform seen on the anaesthesia monitor.
In 34 patients anaesthetized with propofol using two doses of rocuronium (0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg), we studied whether the EMG arousal can be detected visually on the anaesthesia monitor. The Bispectral Index (BIS) and Entropy biosignals on the monitor were recorded with a video camera, and the one-channel EEG recorded by the Entropy strip was collected on a laptop computer. The recordings and the one-channel EEG were analyzed offline by two experts (anaesthesiologist and neurophysiologist), both with a long experience on anaesthesia-related EEG.
EMG arousal existed in 14/34 and 13/33 patients in the BIS and Entropy biosignals, respectively. The anaesthesiologist detected EMG on the monitor in 7/14 patients with BIS (sensitivity 50%) and in 4/13 patients with Entropy (31%). The clinical neurophysiologist detected EMG in 6/14 (43%) patients with BIS and in 5/13 (38%) with Entropy. The specificity of the EMG analyses was 55 and 65% with BIS, and 85 and 90% with Entropy. EMG arousal was detected in BIS biosignal in 10/17 and 4/17 patients with 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg doses of rocuronium (P = 0.04).

Confirmation of such an association would provide further support for BIS theory, especially as it relates to trait differences. EEG was measured (32 electrodes) from extreme groups (low/high trait BIS) engaged in a target detection task. Goal conflicts were introduced throughout the task. Results show that the two groups did not differ in behavioural performance. The major EEG result was that a stepwise discriminant analysis indicated discrimination by 6 variables derived from coherence and power, with 5 of the 6 in the theta range as predicted by BIS theory and one in the beta range. Also, across the whole sample, EEG theta coherence increased at a variety of regions during primary goal conflict and showed a general increase during response execution; EEG theta power, in contrast, was primarily reactive to response execution.

Our study compared entropy with classical bispectral index (BIS) in reduction of myoelectrical interference and noxious stimuli with EEG signals.
Two hundred and eighty patients (ASA I-II, 18-60 years old) undergoing scheduled surgeries from seven medical centers were enrolled. Anesthesia induction was managed with propofol via the target-controlled infusion (TCI) system. The results of BIS, RE, SE, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded before anesthesia induction, at the moment of unconsciousness, before and 2 minutes after administration of muscle relaxant, and before and one and three minutes after the tracheal intubation.
The values of half maximum effective concentrations (EC50), 5% effective concentrations (EC05) and 95% effective concentrations (EC95) of propofol effect-site concentration at the onset of unconsciousness were 1.2 (1.1-1.3 µg/ml), 2.5 (2.4-2.5 µg/ml) and 3.7 (3.7-3.8 µg/ml), while those of the predicted plasma propofol concentration were 2.8 (2.7-2.9 µg/ml), 3.9 (3.8-3.9 µg/ml) and 4.9 (4.8-5.0 µg/ml), respectively.

The values of BIS, RE and SE dropped two minutes after the injection of muscle relaxant, but there were no significant differences between RE and SE. MAP and HR increased visibly, which indicated a reaction to tracheal intubation; the values of BIS, RE and SE, however, did not display any significant changes.
This large-sample multicentric study confirmed the values of RE and SE as approximating BIS value, at the onset of unconsciousness during propofol TCI anesthesia.

Because nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and ketamine share several common features, they are often treated as the same category of anesthetic. Here, we investigated the effect of N(2)O on EEG bicoherence and other EEG derivatives during isoflurane anesthesia.
Twenty patients (aged 34-72 years, ASA physical status I and II) of either gender who underwent elective laparoscopic surgery were included. Raw EEG data, along with EEG-derived parameters, were recorded using an A-1050 Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor and our self-authored Bispectral Analyzer for BIS software. We compared 2 peaks of EEG bicoherence (pBIC-low, around 4 Hz; and pBIC-high, around 10 Hz), as well as BIS and spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF95). Anesthesia was induced with 3 mg · kg(-1) thiopental and 3 μg · kg(-1) fentanyl. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (expired concentration at 1.0%), oxygen, and nitrogen. Fentanyl was added and maintained at an estimated effect-site concentration of >1.5 ng · mL(-1). We obtained baseline data 1 hour after induction of anesthesia, then 70% N(2)O was added for 30 minutes.
Before N(2)O, pBIC-low and pBIC-high were 49.3% ± 8.3% and 42.4% ± 11.0%. Ten minutes after starting N(2)O, pBIC-high decreased to 14.9% ± 5.9% (P < 0.001), and it was statistically significantly lower throughout the N(2)O period. Meanwhile, pBIC-low transiently decreased to 37.2% ± 12.8% (P = 0.01) during the early phase of N(2)O administration. Before N(2)O, BIS and SEF95 were 43.2 ± 4.9 and 13.1 ± 2.0 Hz, respectively. Both BIS and SEF95 slightly but statistically significantly decreased during N(2)O administration. Fifteen minutes after starting N(2)O, BIS and SEF95 were 35.7 ± 6.2 (P < 0.001) and 8.6 ± 1.8 Hz (P < 0.001) and they decreased more when large δ waves emerged. Fifteen minutes after stopping N(2)O, BIS, SEF95, as well as pBIC-low and pBIC-high returned to pre-N(2)O values.

This index is derived from applying combined Wavelet transform, eigenvector and normalisation techniques. The eigenvector method is first applied to build a feature function for six levels of coefficients in a discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The best Daubechies wavelet and their ranking value p are optimally determined to identify different states of anaesthesia. A statistic normalisation process is then carried out to re-scale data and compute the hypnotic depth of anaesthesia. Finally, a new function ZDoA is proposed to compute a DoA index which corresponds one of the five depths of anaesthesia states to very deep anaesthesia, deep anaesthesia, moderate anaesthesia, light anaesthesia and awake. Simulation results based on real anaesthetised EEGs demonstrate that the new index generally parallels the BIS index. In particular, the ZDoA index is often faster than the BIS index to react to the transition period between consciousness and unconsciousness for this data set. A Bland-Altman plot indicates a 95.23% agreement between the ZDoA and BIS indices. The ZDoA trend is responsive, and its movement is consistent with the clinically observed and recorded changes of the patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22575174/
22542439,Baseline EEG theta/beta ratio and punishment sensitivity as biomarkers for feedback-related negativity (FRN) and risk-taking.,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,2012,"Massar SA, Rossi V, Schutter DJ, Kenemans JL","Feedback-related negativity (FRN) is associated with reinforcement learning and punishment sensitivity. Furthermore, reinforcement learning proficiency can be predicted from pre-task baseline EEG theta/beta ratio. In this study it was examined whether there was a relation between baseline theta/beta ratio in rest and FRN amplitude during a gambling task, and if such a correlation would be related to theta activity or to beta activity.
Baseline EEG and a self-report measure of punishment sensitivity (BIS) were obtained from 52 healthy volunteers. FRN was recorded during a gambling task.
FRN amplitude was negatively correlated with theta/beta ratio in high BIS individuals. Furthermore, source localization indicated that baseline theta activity generated in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) accounted for this correlation. For low BIS individuals no correlation was found.
An association between high baseline theta/beta ratio with low amplitude FRN and high risk-taking can be found in individuals who score sufficiently high on the BIS scale. This relationship is carried mostly by baseline theta activity, but not by beta activity.
This link between baseline brain activity, self-report measures and feedback processing may contribute to further understanding the biological basis of conditions that are accompanied by abnormal theta/beta ratio and reward processing, such as attention deficit hyper activity disorder (ADHD).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22542439/

Analgesics drugs are used to control pain from surgical incisions, drainages, vascular access or endotracheal suctioning. Sedatives are used to facilitate the delivery of nursing care, to facilitate mechanical ventilation, prevent self-extubation and to minimize patient discomfort. A therapeutic plan for analgesia and sedation should be established for each patient and regularly reviewed. The most often used sedation agents in PICU patients are Morphine or Fentanyl alone or in combination with Midazolam. Several other drugs should be helpful to manage PICU patients therefore techniques like regional anesthesia and patient controlled analgesia to decrease the use of intravenous analgesia and sedation and to reduce the incidence of withdrawal syndrome. The therapeutic plan for analgesia and sedation should be established for each patient and regularly reviewed. Doses of sedative agents should be titrated to produce the desired level of sedation. The level of sedation should be regularly assessed and documented using few validated sedation assessment tool. However, behavioral evaluation tools based on patient responsiveness, cannot be used during the administration of neuromuscular blocking agents. Under this conditions it could be difficult to interpret the degree of sedation. EEG derived Monitoring devices may represents an useful tools of assessing the level of sedation, but there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of the BIS monitor in PICU.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22512393/
22370587,Time course of expiratory propofol after bolus injection as measured by ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry.,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2012,"Hornuss C, Wiepcke D, Praun S, Dolch ME, Apfel CC, Schelling G","Propofol in exhaled breath can be detected and monitored in real time by ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry (IMR-MS). In addition, propofol concentration in exhaled breath is tightly correlated with propofol concentration in plasma. Therefore, real-time monitoring of expiratory propofol could be useful for titrating intravenous anesthesia, but only if concentration changes in plasma can be determined in exhaled breath without significant delay. To evaluate the utility of IMR-MS during non-steady-state conditions, we measured the time course of both expiratory propofol concentration and the processed electroencephalography (EEG) as a surrogate outcome for propofol effect after an IV bolus induction of propofol. Twenty-one patients scheduled for routine surgery were observed after a bolus of 2.5 mg kg(-1) propofol for induction of anesthesia. Expiratory propofol was measured using IMR-MS and the cerebral propofol effect was estimated using the bispectral index (BIS). Primary endpoints were time to detection of expiratory propofol and time to onset of propofol's effect on BIS, and the secondary endpoint was time to peak effect (highest expiratory propofol or lowest BIS). Expiratory propofol and changes in BIS were first detected at 43 ± 21 and 49 ± 11 s after bolus injection, respectively (P = 0.29). Peak propofol concentrations (9.2 ± 2.4 parts-per-billion) and lowest BIS values (23 ± 4) were reached after 208 ± 57 and 219 ± 62 s, respectively (P = 0.57). Expiratory propofol concentrations measured by IMR-MS have similar times to detection and peak concentrations compared with propofol effect as measured by the processed EEG (BIS). This suggests that expiratory propofol concentrations may be useful for titrating intravenous anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22370587/

Seven patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia for atrial fibrillation ablation were monitored for level of consciousness using bispectral EEG levels (BIS). Isoproterenol infusion was performed after the ablation during anesthesia. BIS levels prior to, during, and post-isoproterenol infusion were recorded and correlated to isoproterenol infusion doses. In all patients, BIS levels significantly increased during isoproterenol infusion (median BIS prior to infusion, 46; during infusion, 64 (p < 0.02)). With a subsequent increase in anesthetic medication, BIS levels could again be reduced.
Isoproterenol infusion alters consciousness level during total intravenous anesthesia for atrial fibrillation ablation. BIS monitoring is a novel way to modulate anesthesia during ablation to potentially optimize patient comfort and ablation success.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22366997/
22344241,Increases in electroencephalogram and electromyogram variability are associated with an increased incidence of intraoperative somatic response.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2012,"Mathews DM, Clark L, Johansen J, Matute E, Seshagiri CV","sBIS, the variability of the Bispectral Index (BIS), sEMG, the variability of facial electromyogram power (EMG), and the Composite Variability Index (CVI) are 3 new measures of electroencephalogram and EMG variability. CVI is a single measure of the combined variability in BIS and EMG. We investigated whether increases in these variables are associated with intraoperative somatic responses.
This multicenter study included 120 patients undergoing elective, noncardiac surgery from 4 different sites. General anesthesia was maintained using propofol and remifentanil at 2 of the sites and sevoflurane and remifentanil at the 2 other sites. Propofol or sevoflurane was adjusted to maintain BIS between 45 and 60. Clinicians were blinded to CVI (v2.0) at all times, and remifentanil infusions were adjusted at the discretion of the clinician. The times of all intraoperative somatic events, defined as movement, grimacing, or eye opening, were recorded. Offline, the maintenance phase of each case was divided into consecutive, nonoverlapping, 10-minute segments. Segments were identified as containing a somatic event or containing no events. For each segment, mean sBIS, sEMG, and CVI and the heart rate (HR) range and mean arterial blood pressure range were calculated. To quantify how effectively each variable discriminated between somatic event segments and nonevent segments, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each variable. Finally, we observed the time course of sBIS, sEMG, CVI, and the HR range before each somatic event and characterized the earliest time before the somatic event at which each variable was able to discriminate between the somatic events and a specified set of nonevents.
The analysis included 33 somatic event segments and 829 nonevent segments from 105 surgical cases. The areas under the ROC curve (±SE) for sBIS, sEMG, and CVI were 0.83 ± 0.04, 0.92 ± 0.02, and 0.89 ± 0.03, respectively. The areas under the ROC curve for HR range and mean arterial blood pressure range were 0.77 ± 0.03 and 0.68 ± 0.05, respectively. CVI, sBIS, and sEMG all demonstrated higher average values before upcoming somatic events when compared with nonevents. HR range only showed a difference within a few seconds before the somatic event.
sBIS, sEMG, and CVI, measures of electroencephalogram and EMG variability, increased when intraoperative somatic events occurred. sBIS, sEMG, and CVI discriminated between 10-minute segments that contained a somatic event and those segments that did not contain an event better than changes in HR and mean arterial blood pressure. Furthermore, CVI increases before somatic events began earlier than HR changes and may provide caregivers with an early warning of potentially inadequate antinociception.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22344241/

Bispectral index (BIS) is an EEG-derived measure which can be sensitive to frontal electromyographic (EMG) artifacts. We compared BIS values before and after sugammadex or neostigmine neuromuscular block (NMB) reversal in patients with or without high EMG activity.
During stable propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia and rocuronium-induced block, 48 patients were randomly allocated to receive sugammadex 4 mg kg(-1) or neostigmine 50 μg kg(-1)/glycopyrrolate 10 μg kg(-1), 10 min after the end of surgery.
Five minutes after sugammadex administration, mean BIS 50.1 (10.3) increased (P=0.018) to 61.7 (7.9) in 11 patients with high EMG activity. In contrast, BIS 49.3 (4.9) remained at 51.9 (5.4) in 13 patients who had no EMG activity. Fifteen minutes after neostigmine administration, mean BIS 51.9 (8.1) increased (P=0.007) to 63.9 (8.1) in 13 patients who had reappearance of muscle activity. However, in 11 patients who had no EMG activity, BIS 52.3 (7.4) remained at 53.3 (6.8). There was no significant difference between the sugammadex and neostigmine groups over time.
We have shown that reversal of NMB with sugammadex or neostigmine increased BIS values dependent on the presence of EMG activity. Thus, the effect of muscle activity reappearance during rocuronium NMB reversal spuriously increasing the BIS value should be taken into consideration when relying on BIS monitoring for evaluating propofol/remifentanil recovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22315331/

EEG data of 40 patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia with either sevoflurane/remifentanil or propofol/remifentanil were replayed to an EEG player and reanalysed by a BIS A-2000® monitor and a Cerebral State Monitor. Further, research into differences between CSI and BIS index values was performed, e.g., extraction of differences of ≥ 10 and ≥ 20 index points and of the EEG length with differing index values.
The overall correlation coefficient was 0.68 without significant difference between propofol or sevoflurane group. In 51.8% of all recordings, both EEG monitors agreed in their classification of the anesthetic level. The number and length of differing index pairs was influenced by varying time delays of index calculation and different algorithms of index computation.
In contrast to previous studies, our current approach combines the following conditions: analysis on basis of identical underlying EEG data from deep to light anesthesia, no guidance of anesthetic administration by one of the EEG-based monitors, avoidance of simultaneous EEG readings and the use of two different anesthetic regimens. Though the result of EEG analysis during anesthesia is similar with both monitors, CSI performance during propofol anesthesia was superior to sevoflurane anesthesia. Consequently, a lower agreement of classification of anesthetic levels between BIS and CSI was reached with the use of sevoflurane. Thus, CSI calculation seems not to be independent from anesthetic agent.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22310192/

In clinical practice, we have noticed a rise in the numerical values of bispectral index (BIS) and Entropy, two electroencephalogram (EEG) - based depth of anesthesia monitors, during the reversal of the NMB with sugammadex. The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study was to test this impression and to compare the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on the BIS and Entropy values during the reversal of the NMB.
Thirty patients undergoing gynecological operations were studied. Patients were anesthetized with target-controlled infusions of propofol and remifentanil, and rocuronium was used to induce NMB. After operation, during light propofol-remifentanil anesthesia, NMB was antagonized with sugammadex or neostigmine. During the following 5 min, the numerical values of BIS, BIS electromyographic (BIS EMG) and Entropy were recorded on a laptop computer, as well as the biosignal recorded by the Entropy strip. The Entropy biosignal was studied off-line both in time and frequency domain to see if NMB reversal causes changes in EEG.
In some patients, administration of sugammadex or neostigmine caused a significant rise in the numerical values of BIS, BIS EMG and Entropy. This phenomenon was most likely caused by increased electromyographic (EMG) activity. The administration of sugammadex or neostigmine appeared to have only minimal effect on EEG.

A number of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based monitors of the anesthetic drug effect such as the bispectral (BIS) index have been proposed to analyze the EEG signal during anesthesia. However, the BIS index has received some criticism. This paper offers a method based on the Hilbert-Huang transformation to calculate an index, called the Hilbert-Huang weighted regional frequency (HHWRF), to quantify the effect of propofol on brain activity. The HHWRF and BIS indices are applied to EEG signals collected from nine patients during a controlled propofol induction and emergence scheme. The results show that both the HHWRF and BIS track the gross changes in the EEG with increasing and decreasing anesthetic drug effect (the prediction probability P(k) of 0.85 and 0.83 for HHWRF and BIS, respectively). Our new index can reflect the transition from unconsciousness to consciousness faster than the BIS, as indicated from the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeled parameters and also from the analysis around the point of reawakening. This method could be used to design a new EEG monitoring system to estimate the propofol anesthetic drug effect.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22273803/

We prospectively studied 102 patients receiving propofol-sufentanil anaesthesia administered by anaesthetists blinded to these indices. The main endpoint was crude agreement (P(0)), defined as the proportion of agreement between BIS and SE index among three categories: <40, between 40 and 60, and >60. Discrepancies in recommendation (DR) were also considered. A DR is type 1 if BIS or SE is <40, while the other is simultaneously >60. A DR is type 2 when BIS and SE index values are on different sides of a threshold (40 or 60) with three subtypes according to the magnitude of their difference. A linear multiple regression was performed to identify covariates that are independently associated with P(0).
In total, 12 147 pairs of values were studied. P(0) was 59.9 (24.5%) [mean (sd)]. Thirty-three patients presented more than 50% discordant pairs and only seven patients presented more than 95% concordant pairs. Type 1 DR occurred in only 1.1% of all the pairs. The median (inter-quartile range) number of type 2 DR varied from 5 (3-8) to 2 (1-3) according to the degree of difference. Multivariate analysis showed that age (P=0.0004) and electrode position (P=0.0084) were independently associated with P(0). An increase in the age of 10 yr decreases P(0) by 5%.

However, there is conflicting evidence that incorporating the BIS into cardiac anesthesia practice improves ""fast-tracking,"" decreases anesthetic drug use, or detects cerebral ischemia. Recent research, including many cardiac surgical patients, shows that a protocol based on BIS monitoring is not superior to a protocol based on end-tidal anesthetic concentration monitoring in preventing awareness. There has been a resurgence of interest in the anesthesia literature in limited montage EEG monitoring, including nonproprietary processed indices.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) can measure intraoperative burst suppression as evidence of cerebral metabolic suppression, but EEG is not always available during clip ligation. This study was conducted to compare the effect of propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with sevoflurane-based inhalational anesthesia on thiopental-induced burst suppression during aneurysm surgery. The effect of thiopental was measured by burst suppression ratio (BSR) using the bispectral index (BIS) monitor.
Forty-six patients who underwent temporary clipping during aneurysm surgery were randomized into 2 groups. The inhalation group (n=21) received sevoflurane-N(2)O anesthesia and the TIVA group (n=25) received propofol-remifenatanil-N(2)O anesthesia. The anesthesia level maintained a BIS value between 40 and 55. Pharmacological burst suppression was induced with bolus administration of thiopental (5 mg/kg) before temporary clipping. The BIS number, BSR values, the onset time and duration of BSR, and hemodynamic variables were recorded every minute in both groups.
There were no significant differences between groups in the onset time of burst suppression (P=0.394) and BIS changes (P=0.878). However, statistically significant longer duration (P<0.001) and significantly higher degree of burst suppression (P=0.006) were observed in the TIVA group compared with the inhalation group.
Our results suggest that at equivalent BIS values TIVA with propofol anesthesia provides longer duration and greater cerebral metabolic suppression compared with sevoflurane-N(2)O inhalation anesthesia.

The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to assess clinical and EEG effects of increasing intravenous (IV) doses of GHB in burn children requiring sedation for burn wound cares.
Thirty six children hospitalized in a burn care unit were included and randomly assigned into three groups (G) according to the single IV dose of GHB they received before burn wound care: 10 mg · kg(-1) in G10, 25 mg · kg(-1) in G25, or 50 mg · kg(-1) in G50. All patients received oral premedication (morphine and hydroxyzine) 30 min before GHB injection. Respiratory rate, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index (BIS) were continuously monitored.

This study compared the SNAP(™) II and BIS Vista monitors in patients undergoing isoflurane anesthesia with normothermic CPB.
40 subjects undergoing CPB with isoflurane anesthesia were enrolled. Subjects were premedicated with 1-2 mg midazolam approximately 5 min prior to acquisition of baseline index values and anesthesia induced with midazolam and fentanyl. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane, midazolam, and fentanyl and a cis-atracurium infusion. SNAP(™) II (version 1.2.9 algorithm 1.88) and BIS Vista (application version 3.00 platform version 2.03) indices were recorded at baseline, pre-induction, post-intubation, incision, start of CPB, every 15 min during CPB, end of CPB, and end of case. Agreement between methods was determined using Pearson correlation and the Bland-Altman method with repeated observa- tions.
Twenty-four male and 12 female subjects completed the analysis. The correlation between SNAP(™) II and BIS Vista index values was 0.61 (P < 0.005). A linear relationship between the difference in the indices and the average index values was observed following the induction of anesthesia. In awake subjects, the bias between the SNAP(™) II and BIS Vista was 5 (95% CI 3-7). The limits of agreement were 23 (95% CI 19-26) and -13 (95% CI -9--16).

Titrating anesthetic administration against the BIS assumes reliable relationships between BIS values, electroencephalogram waveforms, and effect site concentration, beyond loss of responsiveness. Associations among BIS, end-tidal anesthetic concentrations (ETAC), and patient characteristics were examined during anesthetic maintenance, using B-Unaware trial data.
Pharmacokinetically stable ETAC epochs during intraoperative anesthetic maintenance were analyzed. A generalized estimating equation determined independent relationships among BIS, ETAC (in age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration equivalents), patient characteristics, and 1-yr mortality. Further individual and population characteristics were explored graphically.
A total of 3,347,523 data points from 1,100 patients were analyzed over an ETAC range from 0.42 to 1.51 age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration. A generalized estimating equation yielded a best predictive equation: BIS = 62.9-1.6 (if age younger than 60 yr) -1.6 (if female) -2.5 (if American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status more than 3) -2.6 (if deceased at 1 yr) -2.5 (if N2O was not used) -1.4 (if midazolam dose more than 2 mg) -1.3 (if opioid dose more than 50 morphine equivalents) -15.4 × age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration. Although a population relationship between ETAC and BIS was apparent, interindividual variability in the strength and reliability of this relationship was large. Decreases in BIS with increasing ETAC were not reliably observed. Individual-patient linear regression yielded a median slope of -8 BIS/1 age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration (interquartile range -30, 0) and a median correlation coefficient of -0.16 (interquartile range -0.031, -0.50).
Independent of pharmacokinetic confounding, BIS frequently correlates poorly with ETAC, is often insensitive to clinically significant changes in ETAC, and is vulnerable to interindividual variability. BIS is therefore incapable of finely guiding volatile anesthetic titration during anesthetic maintenance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22037642/

21971395,Does depth of anesthesia monitoring improve postoperative outcomes?,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2011,"Monk TG, Weldon BC","Devices using the electroencephalogram to estimate anesthetic depth have been available since 1996. Despite the use of these monitors for over a decade, there is little agreement among clinicians about the need for or value of depth of anesthesia monitoring. Since the majority of the studies evaluating the impact of depth of anesthesia monitoring on postoperative outcomes have utilized the bispectral index (BIS Covidian), this manuscript will focus on studies with this device. This review will evaluate the evidence that BIS monitoring can improve long-term outcomes.
BIS-guided anesthesia can reduce the incidence of awareness with recall in high-risk patients, but a recent study found that anesthetic management directed by an end-tidal anesthetic-agent concentration protocol is equally effective, and probably less expensive. Deep anesthesia (BIS < 45) during the intraoperative period is associated with increased postoperative mortality, but this relationship may be an epiphenomenon rather than causal.
There is growing concern that anesthetic management and even specific anesthetic agents may worsen outcomes in high-risk patients. There is, however, no conclusive evidence that depth of anesthesia monitors can improve outcomes and no evidenced-based reasons for anesthesia providers to change their current practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21971395/

The bispectral index (BIS) monitor incorporated hardware and software changes to eliminate artifacts, thus allowing BIS monitoring even in the presence of electrocautery. We evaluated the accuracy of BIS to measure anesthetic effect during electrocautery interference.
Anesthesia was induced and maintained with target-controlled infusions of propofol (3 μg/mL) and remifentanil (4 ng/mL). After baseline BIS recordings, ""simulated"" electrocautery interference was induced continuously for 20 minutes. Five minutes after the start of electrocautery, propofol infusion was increased to achieve an effect site concentration of 6 μg/mL. Patients remained undisturbed during the study. BIS values and signal quality index were recorded continuously.
During electrocautery, there was a significant decrease in signal quality index (mean difference: 16.9; 95% confidence intervals: 15.9-17.9; P<0.001). There was, however, no change in BIS value even after a step increase in propofol infusion from 3 to 6 μg/mL (P=0.93). In 22% of the patients there was a paradoxical increase in BIS values after doubling of propofol concentration. Following cessation of electrocautery, there was a prompt decrease in BIS (P<0.001), indicating a lack of response to the change in anesthetic depth during electrocautery.
Rejecting and filtering artifacts from electrocautery interference reduced the ability of BIS to respond to a change in anesthetic depth. BIS values during electrocautery should be interpreted with caution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21946766/

The analysis of color density spectral array (CDSA) showed stereotyped changes indicative of recurrent focal nonconvulsive seizures (NCSz) and NCSE. We noted a close correlation between NCSz and BIS value changes. EEGs during working hours always confirmed the persistence of focal NCSE.

We tested the hypothesis that a protocol incorporating the electroencephalogram-derived bispectral index (BIS) is superior to a protocol incorporating standard monitoring of end-tidal anesthetic-agent concentration (ETAC) for the prevention of awareness.
We conducted a prospective, randomized, evaluator-blinded trial at three medical centers. We randomly assigned 6041 patients at high risk for awareness to BIS-guided anesthesia (with an audible alert if the BIS value was <40 or >60, on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the suppression of detectable brain electrical activity and 100 indicating the awake state) or ETAC-guided anesthesia (with an audible alert if the ETAC was <0.7 or >1.3 minimum alveolar concentration). In addition to audible alerts, the protocols included structured education and checklists. Superiority of the BIS protocol was assessed with the use of a one-sided Fisher's exact test.
A total of 7 of 2861 patients (0.24%) in the BIS group, as compared with 2 of 2852 (0.07%) in the ETAC group, who were interviewed postoperatively had definite intraoperative awareness (a difference of 0.17 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.03 to 0.38; P=0.98). Thus, the superiority of the BIS protocol was not demonstrated.

The goal of the study was to describe the occurrence of SR and to determine factors associated with SR during propofol-remifentanil general anaesthesia maintenance.
We conducted a post hoc analysis of BIS recordings in consecutive patients included in two multi-centre trials, undergoing non-cardiac surgery using a dual closed-loop BIS controller allowing automated propofol-remifentanil administration. The percentage of time spent with a BIS value between 40 and 60 (T(BIS 40-60)) was measured.

We studied whether they can differentiate consciousness from unconsciousness during increasing doses of three different anaesthetic agents.
Thirty healthy male volunteers aged 19-30 yr were recruited and divided into three 10-volunteer groups to receive either dexmedetomidine, propofol, or sevoflurane in escalating concentrations at 10 min intervals until loss of consciousness (LOC) was reached. Consciousness was tested at 5 min intervals and after drug discontinuation at 1 min intervals by requesting the subjects to open their eyes. LOC was defined as unresponsiveness to the request and pre-LOC as the last meaningful response. The first meaningful response to the request after drug discontinuation was defined as regaining of consciousness (ROC). For the statistical analysis, pre-LOC and ROC values were pooled to represent the responsive state while LOC values represented the unresponsive state. Prediction probability (P(K)) was estimated with the jack-knife method.
The lowest mean values for BIS, SE, and RE were recorded at LOC with all three drugs. The P(K) values were low for dexmedetomidine (BIS 0.62, SE 0.58, RE 0.59), propofol (BIS 0.73, SE 0.72, RE 0.72), and sevoflurane (BIS 0.70, SE 0.52, RE 0.62).

The aim of this pilot study was to use the BIS monitor to evaluate the depth of procedural sedation in pediatric dental patients and to assess if the BIS monitor readings correlate with a validated pediatric sedation scale, the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS), in determining the level of sedation in these patients. Thirty-five pediatric dental patients requiring sedation were studied prospectively. A baseline BIS reading was obtained and during the procedure an independent observer recorded the BIS every 5 minutes. The operator, who was blinded to the BIS results, determined the UMSS scale at the same 5-minute interval. The patients were monitored postoperatively for 1 hour. There was a significant but moderate correlation between BIS values and UMSS scores (Spearman's rank correlation r  =  -0.574, P < .0001). Percentage of agreement and kappa coefficient using all the observations were also calculated. The percentage of agreement was 37.8%, the kappa coefficient was 0.18 (P < .0001), and the weighted kappa coefficient 0.26 (P < .0001). A lack of correlation was noted between the deeper levels of UMSS sedation scores and BIS values. This study demonstrated a significant correlation between BIS values and the UMSS score in pediatric dental patients undergoing mild to moderate sedation.

Twenty children, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, aged 1-8, were induced and anesthetized with sevoflurane in oxygen. After tracheal intubation, we started maintenance of anesthesia with endtidal sevoflurane concentrations of 2.6%.

We also evaluated responsiveness of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based and hemodynamic parameters to surgical noxious stimulation, skin incision, and sternotomy, hypothesizing that RE would be a better responsiveness predictor.
BIS and entropy sensors were applied before anesthesia induction in 32 patients having elective cardiac surgery. Total intravenous anesthesia was standardized and guided by the BIS index with neuromuscular blockade tested with train-of-four monitoring. Parameters included SE, RE, BIS, forehead electromyography (EMG), and hemodynamic variables. Time points for analyzing BIS, entropy, and hemodynamic values were 1 min before and after: anesthesia induction, intubation, skin incision, sternotomy, cannulation of the aorta, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), cross-clamping the aorta, de-clamping the aorta, and end of CPB; also after starting the re-warming phase and at 10, 20, 30, and 40 min following.
The mean difference between BIS and SE (Bland-Altman) was 2.14 (+16/- 11; 95% CI 1.59-2.67), and between BIS and RE it was 0.02 (+14/- 14; 95% CI 0.01-0.06). BIS and SE (r(2) = 0.66; P = 0.001) and BIS and RE (r(2) = 0.7; P = 0.001) were closely correlated (Pearson's).

The effect of surgical stimulation (Cohen's d) was highest for RE after skin incision (-0.71; P = 0.0001) and sternotomy (-0.94; P = 0.0001).
Agreement was poor between the BIS index measured by BIS VISTA™ and SE values at critical anesthesia time points in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

After induction of anaesthesia, 37 cardiac surgery patients were subjected to increasing electrical stimulation of both the median nerves and subsequent intravenous infusion of remifentanil to suppress this painful stimulation.
The higher intensities of electrical stimulation significantly modified the cortical evoked potentials, the electroencephalogram spectral edge frequency and blood pressure. We also observed the appearance of a middle-latency component in the somatosensory evoked cortical potentials between 60 and 70 ms. These neurophysiological and clinical responses were significantly reduced by remifentanil administration.
The data suggest that somatosensory evoked potentials might be used to detect and monitor painful stimulation during surgery, unlike the bispectral index, which does not seem to be highly sensitive to intraoperative pain.

While BIS® monitors might aid anesthetic management, unprocessed or nonproprietary electroencephalographic data may be a rich source of information for clinicians. We hypothesized that anesthesiologists, after training in electroencephalography interpretation, could estimate the index of a reference BIS as accurately as a second BIS® monitor (twin BIS®) (Covidien Medical, Boulder, CO) when provided with clinical and electroencephalographic data.
Two sets of electrodes connected to two separate BIS® monitors were placed on the foreheads of 10 surgical patients undergoing general anesthesia. Electroencephalographic parameters, vital signs, and end-tidal anesthetic gas concentrations were recorded at prespecified time points, and were provided to two sets of anesthesiologists. Ten anesthesiologists received brief structured training in electroencephalograph interpretation and 10 were untrained. Although electroencephalographic waveforms and open-source processed electroencephalograph metrics were provided from the reference BIS®, both groups were blinded to BIS values and were asked to estimate BIS.
The trained anesthesiologists averaged as close to or closer to the reference BIS® compared with the twin BIS® monitor for 34% of their BIS estimates versus 26% for the untrained anesthesiologists. Using linear mixed effects model analysis, there was a statistically significant difference between the trained and untrained anesthesiologists (P = 0.02), but no difference between the twin BIS® monitor and trained anesthesiologists (P = 0.9).
With limited electroencephalography training and access to clinical data, anesthesiologists can estimate the BIS almost as well as a second BIS® monitor.

Excluding normothermic surgery, which is rarely performed for arch work, circulatory arrest, anterograde, and retrograde cerebral perfusion either in isolation or in combination remain the techniques of ""cerebral protection."" To date, no account of individual patient body or cerebral function variation is involved. Utilizing an electronic perfusion database we retrospectively analyzed 10 patients undergoing aortic arch work with regard to mixed venous saturations during cooling. Perfusion related variables were registered and uploaded to www.perfsort.net. We regarded a saturation of 100% as being indicative of no oxygen extraction, implying no metabolic activity--the theoretical goal prior to a circulatory arrest period. There is enormous variation in the temperature at which metabolic activity of the body stops. We had a range from 17-25 degrees. Patients were cooled for an average of 6 (SD 3.4) degrees below which oxygen extraction had ceased to occur. Potentially we are adding 111 minutes (SD 62) of unnecessary bypass time. This may imply that excessive cooling is occurring in some individuals undergoing arch surgery. Patient directed cooling for aortic arch surgery may help to reduce the morbidity/physical insult associated with severe hypothermia.

In such systems, monitors used as feedback sensors should preferably be Linear and Time Invariant (LTI) in order to limit sensor-induced uncertainty which can cause degraded performance. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of the BIS A2000 (Aspect Medical Systems, MA), the M-Entropy Monitor (GE HealthCare), and the NeuroSENSE Monitor (NeuroWave Systems Inc, OH), by verifying whether their dynamic behavior conforms to the LTI hypothesis.
We subjected each monitor to two different composite EEG signals containing step-wise changes in cortical activity. The first signal was used to identify Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) models that mathematically capture the dynamic behavior of each monitor. The identification of the model parameters was carried out using standard Recursive Least Squares (RLS) estimation. The second signal was used to assess the performance of the model, by comparing the output of the monitor to the simulated output predicted by the model.
While a LTI model was successfully derived for each monitor using the first signal, only the model derived for NeuroSENSE was capable to reliably predict the monitor output for the second input signals. This indicates that some algorithmic processes within the BIS A2000 and M-Entropy are non-linear and/or time variant.
While both BIS and M-Entropy monitors have been successfully used in closed-loop systems, we were unable to obtain a unique LTI model that could capture their dynamic behavior during step-wise changes in cortical activity. The uncertainty in their output during rapid changes in cortical activity impose limitations in the ability of the controller to compensate for rapid changes in patients' cortical state, and pose additional difficulties in being able to provide mathematically proof for the stability of the overall closed-loop system. Conversely, the NeuroSENSE dynamic behavior can be fully captured by a linear and time invariant transfer function, which makes it better suited for closed-loop applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21132561/

In this study, we evaluated different combinations of propofol and remifentanil, administered through a target-controlled infusion system, to estimate the optimal concentrations as well as the best way to control the sedative effects induced by the combinations of drugs in patients undergoing ultrasonographic endoscopy.
One hundred twenty patients undergoing ultrasonographic endoscopy were randomized to receive, by means of a target-controlled infusion system, a fixed effect-site concentration of either propofol or remifentanil of 8 different possible concentrations, allowing adjustment of the concentrations of the other drug. Predicted effect-site propofol (C(e)pro) and remifentanil (C(e)remi) concentrations, parameters derived from auditory evoked potential, autoregressive auditory evoked potential index (AAI/2) and electroencephalogram (bispectral index [BIS] and index of consciousness [IoC]) signals, as well as categorical scores of sedation (Ramsay Sedation Scale [RSS] score) in the presence or absence of nociceptive stimulation, were collected, recorded, and analyzed using an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System. The models described for the relationship between C(e)pro and C(e)remi versus AAI/2, BIS, and IoC were diagnosed for inaccuracy using median absolute performance error (MDAPE) and median root mean squared error (MDRMSE), and for bias using median performance error (MDPE). The models were validated in a prospective group of 68 new patients receiving different combinations of propofol and remifentanil. The predictive ability (P(k)) of AAI/2, BIS, and IoC with respect to the sedation level, RSS score, was also explored.
Data from 110 patients were analyzed in the training group. The resulting estimated models had an MDAPE of 32.87, 12.89, and 8.77; an MDRMSE of 17.01, 12.81, and 9.40; and an MDPE of -1.86, 3.97, and 2.21 for AAI/2, BIS, and IoC, respectively, in the absence of stimulation and similar values under stimulation. P(k) values were 0.82, 0.81, and 0.85 for AAI/2, BIS, and IoC, respectively. The model predicted the prospective validation data with an MDAPE of 34.81, 14.78, and 10.25; an MDRMSE of 16.81, 15.91, and 11.81; an MDPE of -8.37, 5.65, and -1.43; and P(k) values of 0.81, 0.8, and 0.8 for AAI/2, BIS, and IoC, respectively.
A model relating C(e)pro and C(e)remi to AAI/2, BIS, and IoC has been developed and prospectively validated.

These concentrations are associated with AAI/2 values of 25 to 30, BIS of 71 to 75, and IoC of 72 to 76.

AED treatment is usually not recommended for the patients with a first attack, but should be considered for those with a second or third attack. A choice of AED has been based on the expert opinion. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is recommended for both acute and chronic treatment of seizure clusters in patients with BIS. Valproic acid (VPA), CBZ or clobazam (CLB) appears to be a first option of AED for patients with PS. A common first choice for BCECTS is CBZ in the USA and Japan, and VPA in the EU. The treatment period should be as short as possible without waiting for EEG normalization, possibly within 2 years after the initiation of AED. We must remember that some patients with BCECTS may have an ""atypical evolution"". In conclusion, when and how to treat this benign condition should be determined in an individual manner based on the length and frequency of seizures, circadian rhythm of the attacks, interictal EEG findings, cognitive and behavioral functions in daily life and the attitude of the parents toward seizure recurrences and AED side effects.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21095081/
21092128,Peak and averaged bicoherence for different EEG patterns during general anaesthesia.,Biomedical engineering online,2010,"Pritchett S, Zilberg E, Xu ZM, Myles P, Brown I, Burton D","Changes in nonlinear neuronal mechanisms of EEG generation in the course of general anaesthesia have been extensively investigated in research literature. A number of EEG signal properties capable of tracking these changes have been reported and employed in anaesthetic depth monitors. The degree of phase coupling between different spectral components is a marker of nonlinear EEG generators and is claimed to be an important aspect of BIS. While bicoherence is the most direct measure of phase coupling, according to published research it is not directly used in the calculation of BIS, and only limited studies of its association with anaesthetic depth and level of consciousness have been published. This paper investigates bicoherence parameters across equal band and unequal band bifrequency regions, during different states of anaesthetic depth relating to routine clinical anaesthesia, as determined by visual inspection of EEG.
41 subjects scheduled for day surgery under general anaesthesia were recruited into this study. EEG bicoherence was analysed using average and smoothed-peak estimates calculated over different regions on the bifrequency plane. Statistical analysis of associations between anaesthetic depth/state of consciousness and bicoherence estimates included linear regression using generalised linear mixed effects models (GLMs), ROC curves and prediction probability (Pk).
Bicoherence estimates for the δ_θ region on the bifrequency plane were more sensitive to anaesthetic depth changes compared to other bifrequency regions. Smoothed-peak bicoherence displayed stronger associations than average bicoherence. Excluding burst suppression and large transients, the δ_θ peak bicoherence was significantly associated with level of anaesthetic depth (z = 25.74, p < 0.001 and R2 = 0.191). Estimates of Pk for this parameter were 0.889(0.867-0.911) and 0.709(0.689-0.729) respectively for conscious states and anaesthetic depth levels (comparable BIS estimates were 0.928(0.905-0.950) and 0.801(0.786-0.816)). Estimates of linear regression and areas under ROC curves supported Pk findings. Bicoherence for eye movement artifacts were the most distinctive with respect to other EEG patterns (average |z| value 13.233).
This study quantified associations between deepening anaesthesia and increase in bicoherence for different frequency components and bicoherence estimates. Increase in bicoherence was also established for eye movement artifacts. While identified associations extend earlier findings of bicoherence changes with increases in anaesthetic drug concentration, results indicate that the unequal band bifrequency region, δ_θ, provides better predictive capabilities than equal band bifrequency regions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21092128/

20734116,Reversal of neuromuscular blockade by sugammadex does not affect EEG derived indices of depth of anesthesia.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2010,"Illman H, Antila H, Olkkola KT","According to previous studies neuromuscular blockade may affect the depth of anesthesia. One theory states that neuromuscular blockade prevents disturbing EMG signals, arousing from the muscles of the forehead, from falsely elevating bispectral index (BIS)-levels. According to the afferentation theory signals generated in muscle stretch receptors, accessing the brain through afferent nerve pathways, induce arousal. By blocking these signals neuromuscular blockade would increase depth of anesthesia. Arousal has previously been associated with neostigmine reversal. This study investigates the possible effect of sugammadex on the level of anesthesia as defined by BIS and spectral entropy levels.
Thirty elective patients were enrolled. All patients received propofol and remifentanil by target controlled infusion and an intermediate level neuromuscular blockade induced and maintained by bolus doses of rocuronium. Depth of anesthesia was monitored by BIS and spectral entropy. The patients were given 2 mg/kg sugammadex 5 min after finishing of surgery. Propofol and remifentanil infusions were kept unchanged for another 10 min while BIS and entropy values were recorded.
Mean BIS and Entropy™ values remained unchanged after reversal of the rocuronium block. The mean averaged BIS, state entropy and response entropy values were 31.7 ± 9.9, 35.3 ± 12.9 and 36.8 ± 13.3 before and 32.0 ± 11.9, 36.3 ± 15.9 and 38.4 ± 18.0 after sugammadex administration, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to analyze (1) whether the bilateral bispectral (BIS) index, (2) cortisol as a stress marker, and (3) interleukin-6 as a marker of inflammation were different in delirious patients as compared to nondelirious ones after cardiac surgery.
On the first postoperative day, delirium was analyzed in 114 patients by using the confusion assessment method for ICU (CAM-ICU). Bilateral BIS data were determined; immediately thereafter plasma samples were drawn to analyze patients' blood characteristics. The current ICU medication, hemodynamic characteristics, SOFA and APACHE II scores, and artificial ventilation were noted.
Delirium was detected at 19.1 ± 4.8 h after the end of surgery in 32 of 114 patients (28%). Delirious patients were significantly older than nondelirious ones and were artificially ventilated 4.7-fold more often during the testing. In delirious patients, plasma cortisol and interleukin-6 levels were higher (p = 0.01). The mean BIS index was significantly lower in delirious patients (72.6 (69.6-89.1); median [interquartile range (IQR), 25th-75th percentiles] than in nondelirious patients, 84.8 (76.8-89.9). BIS EEG raw data analysis detected significant lower relative alpha and higher theta power. A significant correlation was found between plasma cortisol levels and BIS index.
Early postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery was characterized by increased stress levels and inflammatory reaction. BIS index measurements showed lower cortical activity in delirious patients with a low sensitivity (27%) and high specificity (96%).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20689917/
20680669,The effect of skin incision on the electroencephalogram during general anesthesia maintained with propofol or desflurane.,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2010,"Sleigh JW, Leslie K, Voss L","A variety of effects of surgical incision on the electroencephalogram (EEG) during modern general anesthesia have been previously described; including both increases and decreases in both high and low frequencies in the EEG. What are the patterns commonly seen during routine clinical anesthesia?
We analyzed pre-frontal EEG data from a previously published study (116 adult patients having general anesthesia maintained with either desflurane or propofol) (Leslie et al. in Anesthesiology 111:547-555, 2009), The EEG was quantified using seven estimated parameters: slope and intercept of the underlying non-oscillatory (logarithmically transformed) power spectrum, amplitude and frequency of the episodic frontal alpha (EFA) oscillation, peak power in the delta waveband, high frequency variability index, and bispectral index (BIS). We compared a 30 s EEG segment from 2 min before, with that 2 min after the surgical incision.
The pre-incision EEGs showed a wide spread of different values for the estimated EEG parameters, but the propofol group had increased EFA amplitude. Incision was associated with decreased EFA activity (p = 0.0004), and high frequency variability (p = 0.04, repeated measures ANOVA). The effects of the incision were independent of the type of drug used for maintenance of anesthesia, and on the pre-incision BIS. The loss of EFA tended to be associated with an increase in delta power (r = -0.39, p < 0.0001).
During anesthesia maintained with desflurane or propofol, surgical incision has modest effects on the EEG patterns. It does not cause an increase in high frequency power; the most consistent changes are a loss of EFA amplitude and burst suppression patterns. This effect is not strongly modified by the depth of anesthesia--as estimated by the BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20680669/

Point-of-care monitoring can potentially dictate changes to management intraoperatively. In this observational study, we examined the correlation between a series of point-of-care monitors and lactate flux during CEA.
Both neurosurgeons and vascular surgeons participated in the study. The patients underwent arterial-jugular venous blood sampling for oxygen, carbon dioxide, glucose, and lactate, n = 26; bispectral index (BIS) monitoring ipsilateral to side of surgery, n = 26; raw and processed electroencephalogram (EEG), n = 22; and bi-frontal cerebral oximetry using the Fore-Sight monitor, n = 20.
One patient experienced a new neurological deficit when assessed at 24 hr following surgery. Lactate flux into the brain was correlated with the greatest decrease in cerebral oximetry with carotid cross-clamping; lactate efflux was correlated with the least. The most noticeable changes in processed EEG (density spectral analysis) were also seen with lactate influx, but at a slower time resolution than cerebral oximetry. Loss of autoregulatory behaviour was demonstrated with lactate influx; however, no correlation was seen between lactate flux and BIS monitoring.
There was a correlation between cerebral oximetry and lactate flux during carotid cross-clamping. The Fore-Sight monitor may be of value as a point-of-care monitor during CEA under general anesthesia. A novel finding of this study is lactate flux into the brain in the presence of a large difference in cerebral oxygenation during cross-clamping of the carotid artery.

An electroencephalogram (EEG)-based level-of-consciousness monitor can help minimize intraoperative awareness as well as the effects of over-sedation. In this study, we compared the SNAP II (Stryker Instruments, Kalamazoo, MI USA) and BIS VISTA (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA USA) monitors' primary metrics (SI and BIS, respectively) in terms of correlation, agreement and responsiveness to return to preoperative baseline in surgical cases involving general anesthesia.
With institutional approval and written informed consent, 33 patients received general anesthesia with isoflurane while undergoing abdominal surgery. We attached both the SNAP II and BIS VISTA electrodes to each patient. We collected data from each monitor simultaneously and continuously, beginning just prior to induction and ending after extubation. Each monitor's level-of-consciousness index is a unit less metric that ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating full consciousness. We performed a Bland-Altman and parameter difference analyses on the data. We calculated the time it took for each monitor to return to preoperative baseline level following cessation of anesthesia. We established an equivalence between the two indices over their entire range for our particular clinical scenario.
The indices were correlated (r = 0.736, P < 0.0001, N = 3,706 data point pairs). There was an overall difference between the two indices (median = 16.0, 25th/75th%ile = 10.0/21.1) with BIS lower than SI. A 40-60 BIS range (the typical target range during general anesthesia) was approximately equivalent to a 54-74 SI range. In all 33 subjects, SI reached baseline before BIS at the end of the case (median = 3.3 min, 25th/75th%ile = 1.6 min/8.2 min versus median = 8.9 min, 25th/75th = 3.7 min/14.5 min, P = 0.0200), even though both metrics were equal at the beginning of the case.
Although the SI and BIS both can assess a patient's level of consciousness and are correlated, they are not in agreement with each other numerically and therefore are not interchangeable. It is difficult to assess each monitor's true responsiveness to acute changes in consciousness level from our study design. The differences between the metrics we observed in this study are most likely due to differences in signal processing methodologies, EEG frequencies employed and signal filtering utilized in the monitors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20652380/

We compared both indices with regard to the prediction of the depth of propofol anaesthesia.
In 17 patients, propofol was infused until burst suppression occurred and stopped thereafter until BIS recovered to values above 60. This was repeated; afterwards, patients were intubated, for subsequent surgery. Without surgical stimulus, PSI and BIS were measured simultaneously and compared with the estimated effect-site concentrations of propofol. These were derived from simultaneous pharmacokinetic and -dynamic modelling in an individual two-stage and a population-based NONMEM approach.
A close sigmoid relationship was observed between the propofol effect-site concentration and both PSI [coefficient of determination rho(2)=0.91 (sd 0.05)] and BIS [rho(2)=0.92 (0.03)], which was significantly steeper for PSI [gamma=2.2 (0.6)] than for BIS [gamma=1.8 (0.4)], and reached significantly lower values for PSI [E(max)=0.3 (1.1)] than for BIS [E(max)=5.3 (6.7)] at maximal propofol concentrations. A significantly smaller k(e0) was obtained for PSI [0.09 (0.03) min(-1)] compared with BIS [0.10 (0.02) min(-1)]. PSI and BIS correlated significantly with each other (rho(2)=0.866) and predicted propofol effect-site concentration with a comparable probability [P(K)=0.87 (0.05) and 0.86 (0.05), respectively]. NONMEM revealed E(0)=89.3 and 92.3, E(max)=1.9 and 8.6, C(e50)=1.38 and 1.92 microg ml(-1), gamma=1.6 and 1.48, and k(e0)=0.103 and 0.131 min(-1) as typical values for PSI and BIS, respectively.

This may have potential clinical implications on therapeutic success and elimination of the undesirable effects associated with this treatment modality.
: Propofol anesthesia when compared with barbiturates may induce relatively shorter duration seizures during MECT. This study was designed with the intent to test the hypothesis that the bispectral index (BIS) electroencephalogram (EEG) could predict MECT-induced seizure duration and awakening under propofol anesthesia.
: Twenty-five patients, between 16 and 60 years of age (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II), underwent a total of 100 MECT sessions (4 sessions each) under propofol anesthesia (1.0 mg/kg) in a prospective, observational study. The BIS was monitored continuously, and average BIS values of each of the 4 sessions of MECT that each patient received were analyzed. Bispectral index values were recorded at T0 (baseline), T1 (before induction), T2 (after propofol), T3 (preictal), T4 (postictal), T5 (awakening), and T6 (1 minute after awakening). Motor seizure duration was measured by isolated forearm technique and electrical seizure duration by BIS EEG.
: The mean preictal BIS was 50 (SD, 14), which was found to have a significant positive correlation (P < 0.01) with motor (r = 0.707) as well as electrical seizure duration (r = 0.736). A significant negative correlation was also found between the preictal BIS value and the time to eye opening (3.53 [SD, 1.8] minutes) (r = -0.397; P < 0.05). Awakening occurred at mean BIS value of 52 (SD, 17) (range, 20-97) during this procedure.
: The mean pre-ECT BIS values correlate significantly with the durations of both the motor and electrical seizure activity and awakening time under propofol anesthesia. Before extrapolation to daily clinical practice, further large controlled clinical trials need to be done to establish the role of BIS monitoring in predicting seizure duration and awakening time during MECT.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20562643/

This study assessed the relationships among cumulative duration of low BIS (BIS < 45), intermediate-term mortality, and anesthetic dose after cardiac surgery.
The authors studied 460 patients (mean age, 63.0 +/- 13.1 yr; 287 men) who underwent cardiac surgery between September 2005 and October 2006 at Washington University Medical Center, St Louis, Missouri. By using multivariable Cox regression analysis, perioperative factors were evaluated for their potential association with intermediate-term all-cause mortality.
A total of 82 patients (17.8%) died during a median follow-up of 3 yr (interquartile range, 2.7-3.3 yr). Comparing patients who died with those who survived, there was no statistically significant difference in the relationship between end-tidal anesthetic gas concentrations during the anesthetic maintenance phase and the BIS. Cumulative duration of low BIS was independently associated with intermediate-term mortality. The 1.29 adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI, 1.12-1.49) for intermediate-term mortality with cumulative duration of low BIS translated into a 29% increased risk of death for every cumulative hour spent with a BIS less than 45. The final multivariable Cox regression model showed a good discriminative ability (c-index of 0.78).
This study found an association between cumulative duration of low BIS and mortality in the setting of cardiac surgery. Notably, this association was independent of both volatile anesthetic concentration and duration of anesthesia, suggesting that intermediate-term mortality after cardiac surgery was not causally related to excessive anesthetic dose.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20418692/

The pharmacodynamic interaction of both drugs considering their effect on EEG activity analysed by the bispectral index (BIS) was identified as additive, but this has not been studied in a clinical setting. The objective of this study was to analyse the pharmacodynamic interaction of propofol and sevoflurane on BIS using a surface response model in patients undergoing general anaesthesia with i.v. induction and inhalation maintenance.
We performed a prospective study in 24 patients undergoing general anaesthesia with propofol induction and sevoflurane maintenance. Anaesthetic depth was measured with a BIS VISTA Bilateral monitor. Propofol biophase concentration was determined using a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model, and sevoflurane end-tidal concentration was measured continuously. The response surface model described by Minto and colleagues was used to analyse the interaction. Statistical analysis was performed with Excel 2002 and SPSS v11.0.
The mean value of U(50)(theta) was 0.956 (sd 0.029) in the overall estimated data, and remained within the predefined range for all ratios of the drugs, fulfilling the criterion of additivity. The median of the weighted residuals between the actual BIS value and the BIS value predicted by the model was -5.926%.

Subjects comprised 11 patients scheduled to undergo heart surgery under extracorporeal circulation. Anesthesia was maintained by intravenous administration of propofol combined with remifentanil, using a bispectral index (BIS) monitor to keep an identical BIS value (target BIS value, 40-45). Raw EEG signals were collected through the BIS monitor. Approximate entropy, bicoherence and power spectrum were analyzed before and after CPB, in addition to other EEG parameters.
In the late hypothermic CPB period, both 95% spectral edge frequency and approximate entropy decreased, notwithstanding a lack of significant difference in BIS index. Bicoherence growths in delta-theta and alpha areas decreased simultaneously.
In the late CPB period, although BIS value is unchanged, EEG often expresses a slow EEG rhythm accompanied by disproportional de-synchronous characteristics.
CPB caused the EEG de-synchronous features, which are not quantified by the BIS algorithm. It has the possibility to increase the vulnerability of nociceptive perception.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20382560/

The apparatus necessary for such a diagnosis would typically require time to properly set up and operate. The bispectral index (BIS), an EEG-derived parameter that is easy to establish and easy to use, has been shown to correlate with numerous EEG conditions and may represent a useful tool. Acute encephalitis with refractory, repetitive, partial seizures (AERRPS) is an epileptic syndrome first described by Sakuma in Japan in 2001. We assessed the utility of using BIS monitoring as a diagnostic tool and as a monitor of anticonvulsive therapy in a 14-year-old patient admitted to the intensive care unit with AERRPS. After BIS monitor montage, BIS, electromyography (EMG) and raw EEG data were continuously recorded. Epileptic seizures lasting 1-2 min were repeated every 3-4 min. Using paired t-test analysis, mean +/- SD BIS and EMG peak values at the start of epileptic seizures (94.5+/-3.6, 55.8+/-2.5 dB) were significantly higher than values measured at the end of seizures (55.1+/-12.5, 34.5+/-2.8 dB), respectively. Real-time EEG revealed bursts of epileptiform discharges replaced by slow d and q waves with ictal remissions. During induced pharmacologic barbiturate/diazepam coma, BIS decreased to near isoelectricity (11.9+/-2.5) with a steady increase in suppression ratio (65.5+/-9.7). The characteristic BIS profile of repetitive 1-2 min high EEG/EMG activity could serve as an indicator of a global increase in cerebral activity with seizures.

We found that changes in processed EEG immediately after withdrawal of care were not only reproducible, but can happen in the absence of changes in major electromyographic or electrocardiographic artifact. It is well documented that processed EEG is prone to artifacts. However, in the setting of DCD, these changes in processed EEG deserve some consideration.

We hypothesised that electroencephalogram monitoring would lead to a lower drug consumption as well as shorter recovery times. With institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 90 adult patients undergoing surgery to the upper or lower extremity received regional anaesthesia for post- and intraoperative pain control and were randomised to receive general anaesthesia by propofol/remifentanil infusion controlled either solely by clinical parameters or by targeting Entropy or BIS values of 50. Recovery times and drug consumption were recorded. Data from 79 patients were analysed. Compared with standard practice, patients with Entropy or BIS monitoring showed a similar propofol consumption (standard practice 101 +/- 22 microg/kg/minute, Entropy 106 +/- 24 microg/kg/minute, BIS 104 +/- 20 microg/kg/minute) and showed similar Aldrete scores (10/10) one minute after extubation: 9.1 +/- 0.3, 9.2 +/- 0.6 and 9.3 +/- 0.5, respectively. Time points of extubation were 7.3 +/- 2.9 minutes, 9.2 +/- 3.9 minutes and 6.8 +/- 2.9 minutes, respectively, demonstrating a significant difference between Entropy and BIS (P = 0.023). Compared with standard practice, targeting an Entropy or BIS value of 50 did not result in a reduction of propofol consumption during general anaesthesia combined with regional anaesthesia as performed by an experienced anaesthesiologist in orthopaedic patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20191792/

During out of office hours and weekends, cEEG monitoring is not always available. The Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor can be used to assess the hypnotic component of general anesthesia. We conducted a study to evaluate the feasibility of using the BIS monitoring to assess the burst suppression (BS) pattern during propofol anesthesia in RSE.
Ten adult patients with RSE admitted to the ICU were monitored simultaneously with cEEG and BIS monitoring. We compared the BIS and suppression ratio (SR) values with the EEG burst suppression pattern when the depth of anesthesia was titrated to the BS level monitoring by cEEG.
We found an excellent correlation between the cEEG burst rate per minute and the BIS (r² =-0.9; p< 0.001) and SR (r² = -0.88; p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of BIS score of 30 to detect BS in electroencephalography were 99% and 98%, respectively. The BIS monitor was not able to recognize regional epileptic activity and epileptic bursts during the BS pattern.
The cEEG can be considered as the primary monitoring technique in the assessment of the depth of anesthesia in the treatment of RSE. If cEEG is not available, the BIS monitor can be used to guide the level of anesthesia, targeting BS in patients with RSE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20132290/

This study was undertaken to investigate BIS changes in awake patients with and without neurological deficits during carotid endarterectomy under regional anaesthesia.
Seventy consecutive carotid endarterectomies under regional anaesthesia were divided into two surgical groups: patients with and patients without neurological deficits. Patients' neurological status was evaluated and neurological deficits were compared with BIS values. Measurements were made at different surgical stages: baseline, after sedation, at the beginning of surgery, at preclamping, at the 3 min clamping test, during shunt insertion, at declamping, 15 min after declamping and at the end of surgery. We performed intergroup and intragroup comparisons of BIS values. A decrease in BIS of at least 10 associated with neurological deficits was taken as the cut-off point for the classification of patients with logistic regression models (crude and adjusted for potential confounders).
Thirteen patients (18.6% of the total) developed clinical cerebral ischaemia, though BIS values decreased in 10 of these patients (76.9%). The mean BIS values were 92.5+/-5.6 and 84.7+/-12.3 for patients without and with neurological deficits, respectively (P value<0.05). The odds ratios of a BIS decrease associated with neurological deficits were 8.5 (95% confidence interval 2.1-35.1) and 5.4 (95% confidence interval 1.2-24.3) adjusted for contralateral stenosis.

When trying to model a certain process, it's very important to obtain information of the system behavior under steady-state conditions. In this study the hypnotic and analgesic drugs' effect on the hypnosis index BIS was analyzed, in order to obtain steady-state information of the system response (inputs-output), and in the future model the drugs combined effect.

Annual International Conference,2009,Abenstein JP,"BIS monitoring is a processed electroencephalogram (EEG) technology that is designed to follow the effects that anesthetics and sedatives have on cerebral function. Much is know about the technology, it's utility and limitations. The economic case for widespread utilization of this technology is weak. There appears to be little opportunity to decrease health care cost by either reduction of drug costs or improved practice efficiency. General use of BIS monitoring to reduce the incidence of intraoperative recall (IR) would cost about USD 10,000 to 25,000 per avoided IR. Total cost to the heath care system would approach one billion US dollars per year, just for use during general anesthetics. More appropriate use of already available drugs and technology would most likely decrease the incidence of IR as effectively, although individual patients who are at high risk for IR may benefit from this technology. However, based on current health care economic standards general use of BIS monitoring does not seem warranted and appears not to be cost-effective.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19964196/

Thirty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery receiving remifentanil-propofol anesthesia.
Surgery was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cardiac arrest in 15 patients, with CPB without cardiac arrest in 9 patients and without CPB in 6 patients.
RE, SE, BIS, burst suppression ratio (BSR), and frontal electromyography (f-EMG) were detected simultaneously. RE and SE compared favorably with BIS and their correlations were strong (r(2) = 0.6, r(2) = 0.55, respectively). The mean bias of RE and BIS was -1.8, but limits of agreement were high (+20.5/-24.1). RE and SE tended to be lower than the BIS values in the CPB subgroups. The detection of BSR was similar with RE and SE and the BIS. A strong correlation existed between BIS and f-EMG (r(2) = 0.62) in contrast to RE (r(2) = 0.45) and SE (r(2) =0.39). BIS monitoring was significantly more disturbed than RE and SE with 9.1% +/-10.9% and 0.1% +/- 0.2% of the total anesthesia time, respectively. Neither implicit nor explicit memory was shown.
RE and SE are comparable with the BIS but showed significantly less interference from f-EMG and superior resistance against artifacts. Thus, spectral entropy is more suitable than the BIS during propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in cardiac surgery patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19945300/

We hypothesized that the pupillary light reflex is mediated in part by NMDA receptors and that it would be depressed by the NMDA antagonists, nitrous oxide and ketamine. To study this question, sixteen patients received general anesthesia with desflurane, fentanyl, and muscular relaxation with rocuronium. After a stable level of general anesthesia had been obtained and at least 1h after the start of the surgical procedure, ketamine 1mg/kg (N=8) or saline (N=8) was injected intravenously by random selection. Heart rate, pupil size, pupillary light reflex, BIS scores, and blood pressure were measured every 2min before and for 30min after drug administration. A similar study of sixteen patients was then conducted with either addition of 60% nitrous oxide or 60% nitrogen to the gas mixture. We observed that the pupillary light reflex was depressed by ketamine and nitrous oxide by approximately 50%. The BIS score, representing the processed electroencephalogram, was elevated by ketamine and unchanged with nitrous oxide. Heart rate, pupil size, and blood pressure were unchanged by the drugs when compared to the control groups. We conclude that the two NMDA antagonists ketamine and nitrous oxide depress the human pupillary light reflex during general anesthesia whereas other monitored parameters were either unchanged or paradoxically elevated by the drugs.

The association between BIS/BAS function and anterior cortical asymmetry was tested.
Fifty right-handed women were investigated with 30-channel recordings during an instrumental Go/No-Go learning task. ERPs were elicited to feedback signals indicating monetary losses and monetary gains. Learning performance, FRN, and P3 amplitude and latency measures were calculated and related to BIS and BAS measures by means of ANOVA and correlation analysis. The neural sources of FRN and P3 components of the ERPs were estimated using LORETA software. A resting EEG-alpha-power (8-13Hz) asymmetry measure was obtained.
High levels of Reward Responsiveness (RR), a first order factor of the BAS, were associated with shorter RTs and enhanced positive feelings. The FRN was larger to signals indicating monetary Loss as compared to monetary Gain and enhanced with higher BIS and individual learning ability. Higher RR scores were related to greater left-sided resting frontal cortical asymmetry associated with approach orientation. High-RR subjects, as compared to Low-RR ones, had a smaller P3 amplitude for Go/Loss signals. The P3 latency to No-Go/Gain signals was the best positive predictor of RR. LORETA source localization for the FRN component displayed significantly higher brain electrical activity in left-fusiform gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus to monetary Loss in comparison to monetary Gain after incorrect No-Go responses. For the P3 wave, the monetary Loss produced significantly higher activations in the left superior parietal lobule, right postcentral gyrus, and in the ACC.
The FRN was sensitive to cues of punishment and higher BIS was uniquely related to a larger FRN amplitude on No-Go/Loss trials, linking BIS with conflict monitoring and sensitivity to No-Go cues. Furthermore, the significant interaction found between BIS and RR on FRN amplitude together with the findings linking High-RR levels with shorter RTs, smaller P3 amplitudes and enhanced positive feelings are in line with the hypothesis that both BIS and BAS have the potential to influence punishment-mediated and reward-mediated behaviour.

A 2 microg/kg remifentanil bolus was administered to all patients before skin incision under target-controlled infusion with propofol and remifentanil. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and the area under the curve for the bispectral index of the electroencephalogram were analyzed within the groups and compared between them every 30 seconds for two minutes following the bolus.
Two minutes after the remifentanil bolus, remifentanil predicted effect-site concentrations reached maximum values of 8.46+/-0.91 ng/ml and 9.74+/-1.29 ng/ml in the healthy and hypertensive patients, respectively.

Epileptiform electroencephalogram activity, underlying cerebral pathology, or anticonvulsant/spasmolytic therapy might influence BIS monitoring. Our aim in this exploratory study was to first compare BIS values at 4 different stages of anesthesia between intellectually disabled children and controls. Our second aim was to investigate the discriminative properties of BIS between consciousness and unconsciousness for intellectually disabled children and for controls.
Eighteen intellectually disabled children and 35 control children, aged 2-13 yr, were included. BIS values, landmark events, and standard monitoring values of vital functions were recorded throughout the whole procedure. The performance of BIS in distinguishing between a conscious and unconscious state was assessed from receiver operating characteristic curves.
Median (interquartile range) BIS values for the intellectually disabled group were significantly lower than those for controls in the awake state (72 [48-77] vs 97 [84-98], P < 0.001), during stable intraoperative anesthesia (34 [21-45] vs 43 [33-52], P = 0.02), and during return of consciousness (59 [36-68] vs 73 [64-78], P = 0.009). The discriminative properties of the BIS monitor for the state of consciousness were comparable between the 2 groups according to the receiver operating characteristic curves. Nevertheless, the optimal cutoff BIS value for discrimination between conscious and unconscious state was 28 points lower for the intellectually disabled group.
We advise anesthesiologists to be alert to possible lower BIS values in intellectually disabled children. There is a risk that they will inadvertently misinterpret the state of consciousness in intellectually disabled children. New multicenter studies must find the optimal manner of evaluating (un)consciousness in intellectually disabled patients with documented and confirmed specific etiologies of their intellectual disability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19843782/

We report a case series of seven patients who were neurologically intact before the decision to withdraw care due to extensive systemic critical illness. As part of our end-of-life care protocol, bispectral index (BIS) monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) or SEDline (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) monitoring devices are placed on each patient to ensure adequate comfort. Both monitoring systems use an integer-based system (BIS or PSI, respectively) to reflect the level of consciousness/effect of anesthesia. In each case, loss of blood pressure, as monitored by indwelling arterial line, was followed by a decline is BIS/PSI activity followed by a transient spike in BIS/PSI activity that approached levels normally associated with consciousness. This spike in electroencephalogram (EEG) activity had short duration and the activity then declined to a level of activity associated with burst suppression. In one case of a patient who had a SEDLine device, we were able to capture and analyze the raw EEG signal, and confirm that the EEG waveform was not artifact, and in fact a high frequency waveform was present during the spike activity. We speculate that this level of BIS/SEDline activity is related to the cellular loss of membrane polarization due to hypoxemia. We further speculate that since this increase in electrical activity occurred when there was no discernable blood pressure, patients who suffer ""near death"" experiences may be recalling the aggregate memory of the synaptic activity associated with this terminal but potentially reversible hypoxemia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19803731/

The tentative and controversial findings of a 2006 study suggesting a correlation of mortality with lower intraoperative bispectral index scores were reproduced in a more recent study, but the correlation could be accounted for by controlling for patient comorbidities, particularly malignancy. In a large trial involving patients at high risk for awareness, general anesthesia with volatile agents guided by bispectral index monitoring was associated with a low incidence of awareness, but no more so than the use of alarms for limits on volatile agent concentration. Studies comparing both emerging and more established brain function monitors suggest that, in spite of their different algorithms for processing and filtering electromyographic signal, many monitors are affected by the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Recent evidence is consistent with previous studies that describe a nonlinear model for the dose-response of EEG parameters to increasing concentration of anesthetic agents with a dosing plateau response over a clinically relevant dose range.

Sixty-two mechanically ventilated patients requiring intravenous sedation and analgesia for >or=24 h.
Paired measurements of BIS and sedation measured on the adaptation to intensive care environment (ATICE) score were obtained every 3 h until awakening. A paired measurement with BIS >60 at deep sedation (ATICE Awakeness <or=2) was defined as discordant. Patients were considered discordant if their individual ratio of number of discordant measurements to number of total measurements during deep sedation was above the median discordance ratio of the overall cohort. At least one discordant assessment was observed in 52 patients (83.9%). Median individual discordance ratio was 32% (14.3-50.0%).

The EEG parameters Bispectral index (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA, version XP) and Narcotrend index (MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany, version 4.0) were used as measures of the pharmacodynamic effect.
With IRB approval and informed consent we analyzed the data of three studies including 61 adult patients scheduled for radical prostatectomies. At least 45 min after induction of general anesthesia, end-tidal concentrations of desflurane, sevoflurane or isoflurane were varied between 0.5 and 2 MAC. We transferred the end-tidal concentrations into age-related MAC values. The relationship between MAC effect compartment concentrations and EEG was modeled with a variation of the classical fractional sigmoid E(max) model with two linked sigmoidal curves. All parameters were calculated as a population fit by NONMEM V (GloboMax, Hanover, USA) by minimizing log likelihood.
The k(e0) values of the population fit derived from BIS data were 0.54 min(-1) for desflurane, 0.24 min(-1) for sevoflurane and 0.16 min(-1) for isoflurane, from the Narcotrend index 0.43 min(-1) for desflurane, 0.26 min(-1) for sevoflurane and 0.18 min(-1) for isoflurane.

Because clinical assessment of depth of sedation is labor-intensive, performed only intermittently, and interferes with sedation and sleep, processed electrophysiological signals from the brain have gained interest as surrogates. We hypothesized that auditory event-related potentials (ERPs), Bispectral Index (BIS), and Entropy can discriminate among clinically relevant sedation levels.
We studied 10 patients after elective thoracic or abdominal surgery with general anesthesia. Electroencephalogram, BIS, state entropy (SE), response entropy (RE), and ERPs were recorded immediately after surgery in the intensive care unit at Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores of -5 (very deep sedation), -4 (deep sedation), -3 to -1 (moderate sedation), and 0 (awake) during decreasing target-controlled sedation with propofol and remifentanil. Reference measurements for baseline levels were performed before or several days after the operation.
At baseline, RASS -5, RASS -4, RASS -3 to -1, and RASS 0, BIS was 94 [4] (median, IQR), 47 [15], 68 [9], 75 [10], and 88 [6]; SE was 87 [3], 46 [10], 60 [22], 74 [21], and 87 [5]; and RE was 97 [4], 48 [9], 71 [25], 81 [18], and 96 [3], respectively (all P < 0.05, Friedman Test). Both BIS and Entropy had high variabilities. When ERP N100 amplitudes were considered alone, ERPs did not differ significantly among sedation levels. Nevertheless, discriminant ERP analysis including two parameters of principal component analysis revealed a prediction probability PK value of 0.89 for differentiating deep sedation, moderate sedation, and awake state. The corresponding PK for RE, SE, and BIS was 0.88, 0.89, and 0.85, respectively.
Neither ERPs nor BIS or Entropy can replace clinical sedation assessment with standard scoring systems. Discrimination among very deep, deep to moderate, and no sedation after general anesthesia can be provided by ERPs and processed electroencephalograms, with similar P(K)s. The high inter- and intraindividual variability of Entropy and BIS precludes defining a target range of values to predict the sedation level in critically ill patients using these parameters.

It remains unknown, however, whether loss and return of response to the ARM occur at similar sedation levels. We hypothesized that loss and return of response to the ARM occur at similar sedation levels in individual subjects, independent of the propofol effect titration scheme.
Twenty-one healthy volunteers aged 20-45 yr underwent propofol sedation using an effect-site target-controlled infusion system and two different dosing protocol schemes. In all, we increased propofol effect-site concentration (Ce) until loss of response to the ARM occurred. Subsequently, the propofol Ce was decreased either by a fixed percentage (20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70%; fixed percentage protocol, n = 10) or by a linear deramping (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 microg x mL(-1) x min(-1); deramping protocol, n = 11) until the ARM response returned. Consequently, the propofol Ce was maintained at the new target for a 6-min interval (Ce plateau) during which arterial samples for propofol determination were obtained, and a clinical assessment of sedation (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation [OAA/S] score) performed. Each participant in the two protocols experienced each percentage or deramping rate of Ce decrease in random order. The assumption of steady state was tested by plotting the limits of agreement between the starting and ending plasma concentration (Cp) at each Ce plateau. The probability of response to the ARM as a function of propofol Ce, Bispectral Index (BIS) of the electroencephalogram, and OAA/S score was estimated, whereas the effect of the protocol type on these estimates was evaluated using the nested model approach (NONMEM). The combined effect of propofol Ce and BIS on the probability for ARM response was also evaluated using a fractional probability model (P(BIS/Ce)).
The measured propofol Cp at the beginning and the end of the Ce plateau was almost identical. The Ce50 of propofol for responding to the ARM was 1.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.55-2.10) microg/mL, whereas the corresponding BIS50 was 75 (71.3-77). The OAA/S50 probability for ARM response was 12.5/20 (12-13.4). A fractional probability (P(BIS/Ce)) model for the combined effect of BIS and Ce fitted the data best, with an estimated contribution for BIS of 63%. Loss and return of ARM response occurred at similar sedation levels in individual subjects.
Reproducible ARM dynamics in individual subjects compares favorably with clinical and electroencephalogram sedation end points and suggests that the ARM could be used as an independent instrumental guide of drug effect during propofol-only sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19690246/

This study aimed at investigating the relationship between changes in BIS values during natural sleep and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) variations, as measured by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Data were obtained from six young, healthy, right-handed, male volunteers (20-30 years old) using the H2(15)O infusion method. PET scans were performed both during waking and various stages of sleep. BIS values were monitored continuously and recorded during each PET scan. Positive correlations were detected between BIS and rCBF values in dorsolateral prefontal, parietal, anterior and posterior cingulate, precuneal, mesiofrontal, mesiotemporal and insular cortices. These areas belong to a frontoparietal network known to be related to awareness of self conscious sensory perception, attention and memory. BIS values also positively correlated with activity in brainstem and thalami, both structures known to be involved in arousal and wakefulness. These results show that BIS changes associated with physiological sleep depth co-vary with the activity of specific cortical and subcortical areas. The latter are known to modulate arousal, which in turn allows sustained thalamo-cortical enhancement of activity in a specific frontoparietal network known to be related to the content of consciousness. Thus, although mainly derived from frontal EEG, BIS could represent a wider index of cerebral activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19678596/

The electroencephalographic signs of dreaming during anesthesia and the differences between propofol and desflurane also are unknown. The authors therefore compared dream recall after propofol- or desflurane-maintained anesthesia and analyzed electroencephalographic patterns in dreamers and nondreamers and in propofol and desflurane patients for similarities to rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep.
Three hundred patients presenting for noncardiac surgery were randomized to receive propofol- or desflurane-maintained anesthesia. The raw electroencephalogram was recorded from induction until patients were interviewed about dreaming when they became first oriented postoperatively. Using spectral and ordinal methods, the authors quantified the amount of sleep spindle-like activity and high-frequency power in the electroencephalogram.
The incidence of dream recall was similar for propofol (27%) and desflurane (28%) patients. Times to interview were similar (median 20 [range 4-114] vs. 17 [7-86] min; P = 0.1029), but bispectral index values at interview were lower (85 [69-98] vs. 92 [40-98]; P < 0.0001) in propofol than in desflurane patients. During surgery, the raw electroencephalogram of propofol patients showed more and faster spindle activity than in desflurane patients (P < 0.001). The raw electroencephalogram of dreamers showed fewer spindles and more high-frequency power than in nondreamers in the 5 min before interview (P < 0.05).
Anesthetic-related dreaming seems to occur just before awakening and is associated with a rapid eye movement-like electroencephalographic pattern.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19672164/

All currently available monitors need varying time periods to calculate a new index when reacting to changes in anaesthetic depth. The exact time delay for calculation of new index values is unknown. In a previous study, we used simulated EEG signals and found considerable time lags for the cerebral state index (Danmeter, Odense, Denmark), the bispectral index (Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Newton, MA, USA), and the Narcotrend index (MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the time delays observed with simulated EEG signals also applied to real EEG data.
We used perioperatively recorded EEG data from a database corresponding to the awake state, general anaesthesia, and suppression of cortical activity, respectively. After a switch from one state of consciousness to another, the time necessary for all indices to adjust the index value to the underlying input signal was measured.
We found time delays for all indices between 24 (7) and 122 (23) s before the new state was indicated. In accordance with our previous results, these time delays were not constant and depended on the particular starting and target index value. Results were different for decreasing and increasing values.
Our results may show a limitation of the value of electronic EEG indices in prevention of awareness with recall. Furthermore, due to different time delays for ascending and descending values, the results of pharmacodynamic studies may be influenced by this phenomenon.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19648154/

We evaluated the usefulness of bilateral bispectral index monitoring using two monitors and two sensors placed above the frontal region. Spikes were readily detected on the electroencephalogram on the bispectral index monitor, and the frequency of their occurrence increased or decreased in response to adjustment of the sevoflurane concentration. The disappearance of synchronisation between the left and the right hemispheres was observed with use of the bispectral index - in concordance with the electrocorticogram. Thus, 'spike-monitoring anaesthesia' using bilateral bispectral index was useful in assessing both the effect of anaesthetics on the electroencephalogram signals and the surgical therapeutic effect.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19624634/

Withdrawal (BIS system) and appetitive (BAS system) behaviour showed opposite patterns of subjective responses. Also, a specific frontal network was found to be responsive to the relevance of emotional cues. Moreover an increased response for high arousing (negative and positive) stimuli in comparison with low arousing and neutral stimuli was found within the left and right frontal areas. Specifically delta and theta band have a significant role in monitoring the attentional significance of emotions. Finally, the effects of subjective evaluation and individual differences were discussed at light of the two-dimensional model of emotion processing, that is the valence and the arousing power of emotional cues.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19591907/

In adults, independent of age, adequate and safe depth of anaesthesia for surgery is usually assumed when these indices are between 40 and 60. Since the EEG is changing with increasing age, we investigated the impact of advanced age on BIS, SE, and RE indices during induction.
BIS and SE/RE indices were recorded continuously in elderly (> or =65 yr) and young (< or =40 yr) surgical patients who received propofol until loss of consciousness (LOC) using stepwise increasing effect-site concentrations. LOC was defined as an observer assessment of alertness/sedation score <2, corresponding to the absence of response to mild prodding or shaking.
We analysed 35 elderly [average age, 78 yr (range, 67-96)] and 34 young [35 (19-40)] patients. At LOC, all indices were significantly higher in elderly compared with young patients: BIS(LOC), median 70 (range, 58-91) vs 58 (40-70); SE(LOC), 71 (31-88) vs 55.5 (23-79); and RE(LOC), 79 (35-96) vs 59 (25-80) (P<0.001 for all comparisons). With all three monitors, only a minority of elderly patients lost consciousness within a 40-60 index range: two (5.7%) with BIS and RE each, and seven (20%) with SE. In young patients, the respective numbers were 20 (58.8%) for BIS, 13 (38.2%) for SE, and nine (26.5%) for RE.

Fifty mechanically ventilated cardiac surgical patients undergoing propofol and morphine sedation were assessed hourly for up to 6 hours or until tracheal extubation using the BIS, PSI, and RSS. Correlation between RSS, BIS, and PSI was determined, as well as the interrater reliability of RSS, BIS, and PSI. kappa statistics was used to further evaluate the agreement between BIS and PSI.
There was positive correlation between BIS and PSI values (rho = 0.731, P < .001). The average weighted kappa coefficient was .40 between the BIS and PSI, 0.28 between the RSS and BIS, and 0.16 between the RSS and PSI. Intraclass correlation was consistently higher between the BIS and PSI at all time intervals during the study. Logistic regression modeling over study duration showed that the BIS was consistently better at predicting oversedation (area under the curve, 0.92) than the PSI (area under the curve, 0.78). A comparison of BIS and PSI receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the BIS monitor was a better predictor of oversedation compared with the PSI (P = .02).
There is significant positive correlation between the BIS and PSI but poor correlation and poor test agreement between the RSS and BIS as well as RSS and PSI.

Second, the behavioural activation system (BAS) and behavioural inhibition system (BIS) were considered as an explicative factor to verify the effect of a motivational/emotional variable on alpha activity. A total of 19 participants looked at an ample range of facial expressions of emotions (anger, fear, surprise, disgust, happiness, sadness, and neutral) in random order. The results demonstrated that anterior frontal sites were more active than central and parietal sites in response to facial stimuli. Moreover, right and left side responses varied as a function of emotional types, with an increased right frontal activity for negative, aversive emotions vs an increased left response for positive emotion. Finally, whereas higher BIS participants generated more right hemisphere activation for some negative emotions (such as fear, anger, surprise, and disgust), BAS participants were more responsive to positive emotion (happiness) within the left hemisphere.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of systemic administration of lidocaine on postoperative pain and morphine requirements after propofol-remifentanil-based anaesthesia.
Forty patients undergoing thoracic surgery were randomly assigned to lidocaine (33.0 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) and physiological saline control groups in propofol-remifentanil-based anaesthesia. The setting of the plasma concentration (C(p)) of the target-controlled infusion of propofol was adjusted according to the bispectral index of the electroencephalogram and blood pressure. The C(p) and effect-site concentration (C(e)) of propofol were calculated by target-controlled infusion pump during the intraoperative period. Pain scoring includes a four-point verbal rating scale, Riker's sedation-agitation scale and a visual analogue scale; the morphine requirement in the postanaesthesia care unit and the morphine consumption via a patient-controlled analgesia device on the ward were recorded during the postoperative period.
Morphine requirements within 30, 30-60 and 0-120 min in the postanaesthesia care unit of the lidocaine group decreased significantly (P < 0.05, n = 20 per group) compared with that of the control group. The four-point verbal rating scale at 30 min in the postanaesthesia care unit, visual analogue scale at 6 h on coughing and patient-controlled analgesia morphine consumption during 2-6 h postoperative time were also significantly (P < 0.05, n = 20 per group) reduced in the lidocaine group. In addition, the intraoperative propofol C(e) in the lidocaine group during the periods of intubation, organ resection, closing of chest cavity and extubation was significantly lower (P < 0.05, n = 20 per group) than that in the control group under the same hypnotic depth.

The aim of the current paper is to document the presence of the syndrome in Saudi Arabia and in Arab populations and to discuss the characteristic electroclinical features and the benign nature of this syndrome.
A case series of 275 patients with epileptic seizures (age range: 2 months-13 years) were followed over a period of 3 years and 7 months. The inclusion criteria for BIS were as follows (1) age of seizure onset between 2 and 24 months, (2) normal development before, during and after the onset of seizures, (3) normal interictal EEG, (4) normal brain imaging, and (5) good response to treatment. We analyzed these infants with respect to age at seizure onset, sex, physical and neurological examination, consanguinity, frequency and type of convulsions, associated conditions and laboratory and radiological investigations. A waking and sleeping interictal EEG was performed on all patients, and for one patient (No. 1), ictal EEG and video clips were recorded.
Fourteen infants (12.0%) showed electroclinical features consistent with BIS. Eleven patients fulfilled the criteria of benign non-familial infantile seizures (BNFIS), and for three patients, their family pedigrees showed the possibility of benign familial infantile seizures (BFIS). All of the patients responded to anti-epileptic treatment, and 50% of them responded within 3 months.

Both indices use a single-channel electroencephalogram, recorded from a unilaterally applied electrode on the forehead, as their input. Intrapatient reproducibility of BIS was questioned in a recent study in which simultaneous measurements from two electrodes applied to the same patient showed conflicting anesthetic depths. Our purpose was to determine whether SE results are similarly reproducible, even though their computation uses a different algorithm than BIS. In this study, we investigated the reproducibility of SE measurements simultaneously obtained from bilaterally applied electrodes in the same patient.
Entropy electrodes were applied bilaterally on 21 patients under general inhaled anesthesia. Simultaneous SE measurements from both electrodes were recorded every 10 s from each patient. Data were analyzed with Bland-Altman statistics.
We obtained 14,379 pairs of SE measurements. Four percent of the individual measurements suggested conflicting anesthetic depth along with a numeric difference more than 10 points. Bias was not clinically significant (-0.3). Ninety-five percent limits of agreement were -11.7 and +11.6.
SE showed a clinically significant degree of disagreement when probes were applied on both sides of the forehead in the same patient. Bland-Altman statistics showed better same-patient reproducibility in SE than did a similar study on BIS. Nevertheless, 4% of the simultaneously measured pairs of SE suggested different anesthetic depths and differed by more than 10 points.

If hypoxia per se changes BIS and spectral entropy values, BIS and spectral entropy values may not correctly reflect the depth of anaesthesia during hypoxia. The aim of this study was to examine the changes in BIS and spectral entropy values during hypobaric hypoxia in volunteers.
The study was conducted in a high-altitude chamber with 11 volunteers. After the subjects breathed 100% oxygen for 15 min at the ground level, the simulated altitude increased gradually to the 7620 m (25,000 ft) level while the subjects continued to breathe oxygen. Then, the subjects discontinued to breath oxygen and breathed room air at the 7620 m level for up to 5 min until they requested to stop hypoxic exposure. Oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate, 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), BIS, response entropy (RE), and state entropy (SE) of spectral entropy were recorded throughout the study period.
Of the 11 subjects, seven subjects who underwent hypoxic exposure for 4 min were analysed. SpO2 decreased to 69% at the 7620 m level without oxygen. However, SEF, BIS, RE, and SE before and during hypoxic exposure were almost identical.

The use of BIS to monitor the depth of anesthesia reduces the incidence of intraoperative awakening and recall, among other benefits. The objective of this review was to present clinical situations in which the BIS gives false results, either elevated or decreased, due to conditions related to the patient or anesthetic actions unforeseen when the algorithm was elaborated.
The bispectral index can be altered and influenced in different clinical situations in which abnormal EEG patterns are present; the effects of different anesthetics and other drugs not included when the algorithm was elaborated; interference from electrical equipment; as well as peculiarities of the monitor.

A new electroencephalographic (EEG) monitor, the EEGo, processes a raw EEG signal using time-delay analysis to display a reproducible signal transition from deep anesthesia through the excitement state to the awake state. We hypothesized that the EEGo monitor would be superior to the bispectral (BIS) monitor, not only in aiding emergence but also in detecting sudden changes in levels of hypnosis.
Twenty-one patients undergoing neurosurgery were studied (16 MVD, 5 cerebral aneurysm clipping). Each patient had both EEGo and BIS monitoring with only one monitor available for viewing by the anesthesiologist. The anesthetic was titrated based on the available monitor, and the time to emergence was measured. Intraoperative detection of arousal and the timing of burst suppression during propofol administration were also examined.
In the MVD patients, there was no statistical difference in wake-up times between the EEGo and BIS groups. Additionally, there were no episodes of intraoperative awareness and no differences in patient satisfaction. Compared to EEGo waveform output, a decrease in BIS output was delayed in four patients receiving propofol for burst suppression during cerebral aneurysm clipping, indicating enhanced hypnosis. One case of intraoperative arousal, which occurred at a BIS reading of 43 arbitrary BIS units, was detected earlier with the EEGo.
While the EEGo was faster than the BIS at indicating planned changes in levels of hypnosis throughout propofol administration prior to temporary clipping during aneurysm surgery, the EEGo was not superior to the BIS monitor in facilitating a more rapid emergence following neurosurgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19340492/

Twenty-four patients (ASA II or III, age 25-62 years, BMI 35.5-61.7) were randomly allocated to receive propofol target-controlled infusion based on a weight adjustment formula (group adjusted) or without adjustment [group total body weight (TBW)]. Anaesthesia was induced by a propofol-targeted concentration of 6 microg ml that was subsequently adapted to maintain stable bispectral index values ranging between 40 and 50. Arterial blood samples were collected before the start of the infusion and every 15 min thereafter to determine the predictive performances.
There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to performance errors, divergence and wobble. Results are presented as median (interquartiles). Median performance error and median absolute performance error were -31.7 (-35.9, -19.4) and 31.7% (20.2, 35.9) for group adjusted and -16.3 (-26.3, 2.2) and 20.6% (14.8, 26.9) for group TBW, respectively. Wobble median value was 7.4% (3.8, 8.4) for group adjusted and 8.2% (7.0, 9.6) for group TBW. As for wobble and divergence, no statistically significant differences were found between groups.
Weight adjustment causes a clinically unacceptable performance bias, which is not corrected when TBW is used as an input to the 'Marsh' model.

Thirty adult patients undergoing spine surgery were randomized to receive halothane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane, in 2 stages, (a) with air/oxygen mixture (2:1) and (b) in nitrous oxide/oxygen (2:1). Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, response entropy (RE), and state entropy (SE) were noted at 1.0 and 1.5 MACs for each agent. Statistical analysis was done using the 2-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni correction and Student t test for paired data. P value of less than 0.05 were considered significant. The demographics and baseline values of heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, RE, and SE were comparable. Changing from air/oxygen as carrier gas to 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen resulted in significant increase in both RE and SE at 1.0 MAC for all the agents (P<0.05). Among the agents, it was found that both RE and SE values were significantly higher during halothane anesthesia as compared with sevoflurane and isoflurane (P<0.05). At 1.5 MAC for all agents, after addition of nitrous oxide, there was an insignificant reduction in both RE and SE (P>0.05).

19291556,Bispectral index monitoring in helicopter emergency medical services patients.,Prehospital emergency care,2009,"Heegaard W, Fringer RC, Frascone RJ, Pippert G, Miner J","Background. Many critically ill patients are given sedatives and paralytics to facilitate aeromedical transport. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is a computer-derived electroencephalography (EEG) analog currently used to monitor the level of awareness of sedated patients. It gives a score of 1-100, with 1 representing no brain function and 100 representing a completely alert patient. Objective. To evaluate whether critically ill patients are adequately sedated during aeromedical transport. Methods. This was a prospective, observational study of a convenience sample of critically ill patients transported by helicopter. All intubated patients who received sedatives and/or paralytics to facilitate transport were eligible for enrollment by the attending clinician. Prior to liftoff, a BIS sensor was applied to the patient's forehead. Minimum, maximum, and mean BIS index scores were recorded every minute during transport. Results. Forty-seven patients (57% male) were enrolled, with a median age of 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 18-81, range 14 to 86 years). The median duration of monitoring was 15.0- minutes (IQR 6.0-26.0, range 2 to 33). The median BIS score was 54.6 (IQR 38.6-67.3, range 28 to 89.5). Only two patients (4.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5% to 14.8%) had at least one BIS score greater than 85, the accepted threshold for recall. Conclusion. These results suggest that patients are adequately sedated during air medical transport.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19291556/
19282299,Rocuronium dose-dependently suppresses the spectral entropy response to tracheal intubation during propofol anaesthesia.,British journal of anaesthesia,2009,"Kawaguchi M, Takamatsu I, Kazama T","The Entropy Module anaesthesia monitor displays two spectral entropy-based indices, response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE). The difference between RE and SE (RE-SE), which mainly reflects electromyography activation, is thought to indicate the adequacy of antinociception. Little is known, however, about the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents on the RE-SE. We investigated the effects of rocuronium on the RE-SE response to tracheal intubation.
Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four rocuronium doses (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 mg kg(-1)). Anaesthesia was induced by propofol target-controlled infusion. Rocuronium was administered 2 min after anaesthesia induction. Tracheal intubation was performed 7 min after anaesthesia induction. Arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), bispectral index (BIS), RE, SE, and patient movement were recorded.
All EEG-derived indices (BIS, RE, SE, and RE-SE) increased after tracheal intubation. The maximum increase in the indices after tracheal intubation was significantly suppressed by an increase in the rocuronium dose. Patient movement after tracheal intubation was suppressed by an increase in the rocuronium dose. All indices were higher in patients who moved during or after tracheal intubation than in those who did not move. Rocuronium dose did not affect the mean arterial pressure or HR in response to tracheal intubation.
The RE-SE response to tracheal intubation was suppressed by increasing the rocuronium dose. Estimates of nociception using RE-SE should be interpreted carefully in different states of muscle paralysis during general anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19282299/

It was hypothesized that individuals with high BAS sensitivity would experience higher emotional arousal in the reward expectancy situation and lower in the punishment expectancy situation than individuals with low BAS activity. The level of emotional arousal indicated by theta spectral power, and general cortical excitability indicated by high frequency oscillations (HFO), were measured in a sample of young people who filled out Carver and White's Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Approach System (BIS/BAS) scales. Frontal theta and HFO increased in high BAS scorers during expectation of reward and decreased during expectation of punishment. In low BAS scorers spectral powers of theta and HFO increased, contrary to those for the punishment cue, and decreased for reward cue. Theta-gamma coupling increased in high Drive scorers (those above the median) in reward and in low Drive scorers (those who appeared to be below the median split on this scale) in punishment situation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19278126/

Entropy is similar to the BIS monitor, as both process raw EEG to derive a number. We hypothesized that entropy may also be anesthetic agent-specific. Thirty adult patients undergoing spinal surgery were randomized to receive halothane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane. Entropy indices were recorded at various minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) values-0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 1.5-both during wash-in and wash-out of the agent. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), response entropy (RE), and state entropy (SE) were noted. Statistical analysis was done using a one-way analysis-ofvariance test. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Ten patients in each group completed the study. The demographics and baseline values of HR, MAP, RE, and SE were comparable in all three groups. During the study period, for a given MAC value, both RE and SE remained low in the isoflurane and sevoflurane groups compared to the halothane group. For a given MAC, the RE and SE were comparable during wash-in and wash-out phases. Halothane produced higher entropy values as compared to isoflurane and sevoflurane at equivalent MAC levels.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19234845/

The present study was performed to compare the bispectral index (BIS) and the auditory evoked potentials index (AAI) during light sedation with propofol infusion in spinal anesthesia.
Eighty patients, aged 20 to 70 years, scheduled for surgery of the lower extremities under spinal anesthesia were assigned to one of four groups (20 patients each). Patients in the AAI propofol and BIS propofol groups were sedated with propofol infusion at an initial rate of 2 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1). Propofol infusion was controlled to try to keep the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAAS) scale at 3 or 4. Patients in the AAI control and BIS control groups did not receive propofol.
The OAAS scales and the AAI or BIS decreased significantly in all groups during surgery, while the decrease was larger in the AAI propofol and BIS propofol groups. The AAI was significantly lower along with lower OAAS scales. There was no overlap in the AAI between OAAS scale 3 and scale 5 in the AAI propofol group, while in the BIS propofol group, no difference was observed in the BIS among OAAS scales 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Ten healthy volunteers were sedated in a stepwise manner with doses of either midazolam and remifentanil or dexmedetomidine and remifentanil. One week later the procedure was repeated with the remaining drug combination. The doses were adjusted to achieve three different sedation levels (Ramsay Scores 2, 3 and 4) and controlled by a computer-driven drug-delivery system to maintain stable plasma concentrations of the drugs. At each level of sedation, BIS and Entropy (response entropy and state entropy) values were recorded for 20 minutes. Baseline recordings were obtained before the sedative medications were administered.
Both inter-individual and intra-individual variability increased as the sedation level deepened. Entropy values showed greater variability than BIS(R) values, and the variability was greater during dexmedetomidine/remifentanil sedation than during midazolam/remifentanil sedation.
The large intra-individual and inter-individual variability of BIS and Entropy values in sedated volunteers makes the determination of sedation levels by processed electroencephalogram (EEG) variables impossible. Reports in the literature which draw conclusions based on processed EEG variables obtained from sedated intensive care unit (ICU) patients may be inaccurate due to this variability.

Annual International Conference,2008,"Jensen EW, Jospin M, Gambus PL, Vallverdu M, Caminal P","The level of consciousness of patients undergoing surgery evolves continuously as the effect of the anesthetic agents is counteracted by the surgical stimuli. The monitors of depth of anesthesia, based on the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), have been progressively introduced into the daily practice to provide additional information about the state of the patient. In this work, the Index of Consciousness (IoC), a recent index which uses the information from EEG spectrum and symbolic dynamics through a fuzzy inference system, is introduced. The bispectral index BIS, a well-established index, is used to validate the IoC. A good correlation is found between both indexes. Furthermore, IoC presents a significantly higher prediction probability Pk of the level of sedation than BIS, and can thus be considered as an interesting measure of the level of consciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19163975/

Data has been collected from 21 adult patients and grouped into young adults (18 - 39 yrs, n=3), middle-aged (40 - 64 yrs, n=10) and the elderly (65+ yrs, n=8). The power of the EEG gamma activity was recorded from Fpz - Mastoid and the power of the EMG was recorded from Fpz - Mastoid and Masseter - Mastoid. It has been found that when considered alone, EEG gamma power is associated with both BIS index and consciousness versus unconsciousness, showing a decrease in power as consciousness is lost. When the effect of EEG gamma power is adjusted for EMG, it is found that generally these associations can be explained by the EMG power alone. There are two exceptions to this. In the young adults group there is a stronger association between BIS index and EEG gamma than there is between BIS index and EMG. In the elderly group, the state of consciousness is equally associated with EEG gamma and EMG recorded from the Masseter, but not with the EMG recorded from Fpz.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19162784/

In this situation continuous EEG offers a convenient, effective method of monitoring the depth of sedation, using spectral edge frequency (SEF) to quantify EEG activity. The authors report 3 patients with severe Guillain-Barré syndrome managed with sedation aimed at a SEF95 below 4.0 Hz (delta coma), using a subhairline montage with the DATEX bedside EEG module. Two of the patients were easily managed using this system for an average of 16 days, and both were completely amnestic of this period of time with no serious complication. The third one had still some residual muscle activity and SEF was unreliable in this case, so its use was abandoned. Continuous EEG monitoring using SEF is a useful tool to manage sedation in the most severely paralyzed Guillain-Barré syndrome patients. Incorporation of a low-pass filter would be of benefit to remove any residual muscle activity, which confounds the target level of sedation with this method; SEF has theoretical advantages over the bispectral index in this population.

However, there are suggestions that EEG derived anesthesia depth monitors have inferior performance in infants. The aim of this study was to quantify the degree of sedation during spinal anesthesia in infants using another EEG derived measure of anesthesia effect--the Cerebral State Index (CSI).
Twelve infants, <52 weeks postconceptual menstrual age, scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair under spinal anesthesia were enrolled. Patients received a standard anesthetic protocol with a subarachnoid dose of 1 mg x kg(-1) of levobupivacaine 0.5%. No premedication, sedatives, opioids or anticholinergics were administrated during the perioperative period and patients were left undisturbed during the surgical time, without tactile stimulation or loud auditory stimuli. CSI score (0-100) and bust suppression (BS) (0-100%) were continuously recorded during the surgical time and then statistically re-evaluated.
In all patients the CSI fell during the procedure and there were significant levels of BS recorded by the CSI monitor. The BS occurred between 12 and 34 min after spinal anesthesia with the peak being at 30 min and mean onset time being 15 (2.6) min after spinal block. A statistical significant difference was found between the lowest mean CSI as well as the highest BS if compared with their baseline values. A negative correlation was found between CSI and BS.
The degree of burst suppression detected by the CSI in our study supports the hypothesis that infants may have discontinuous patterns of EEG during spinal anesthesia similar to those seen during emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, the limitations in the application of the adult algorithms to infant EEG may lead to an overestimation of the degree of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19143957/

The objective of this study was to determine whether DSIP could be used as an adjunct to volatile anaesthesia in humans, our hypothesis being that DSIP is a natural hypnotic that would increase anaesthetic depth. The aims were to assess depth of anaesthesia using bispectral index (BIS), the EEG and heart rate variability (HRV), and to determine whether DSIP altered the symmetry of EEG between the left and right cerebral hemispheres.
Twenty-four female ASA I or II patients gave written, informed consent to a protocol approved by our local research ethics committee. Twelve were randomly assigned as controls to receive saline. The other 12 were randomly allocated to receive one of three intravenous bolus doses of DSIP (Clinalfa) at 25, 50 or 100 nmol kg(-1). The first administration of DSIP was while awake and the second after induction of anaesthesia with propofol and maintenance with isoflurane. BIS and EEG parameters were measured continuously using a bilateral electrode montage.
DSIP significantly increased heart rate, decreased HRV and, paradoxically, significantly reduced delta rhythm along with reducing burst suppression and increasing BIS at 25 nmol kg(-1) during isoflurane anaesthesia. DSIP also significantly altered bilateral symmetry of EEG.
DSIP probably reduced parasympathetic tone and decreased (lightened) the depth of anaesthesia measured using BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19142086/

Previous studies in children have suggested BIS performs well in older children, however these studies have used earlier versions of the BIS device. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of BIS over different age groups using the BIS paediatric Quattro sensor (Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA, U.S.A.). One hundred and eighty children between one and 13 years were enrolled. At a predetermined time during emergence from anaesthesia, wakefulness was assessed and BIS recorded. For analysis, children were divided into four groups (one to three, three to six, six to nine and nine to 13 years) and for each age group a receiver operating characteristic curve was generated. Areas under the curve were compared across age groups. Good quality BIS data was available in 161 children. The areas under the curves for each age group were: one to three years 0.80, three to six years 0.88, six to nine years 0.85 and nine to 13 years 0.95. Although the area was least in the youngest age group and greatest in the oldest age group, there was no evidence for a difference when tested with ANOVA (P=0.26). When combining all age groups taking a BIS value of 50 or greater provided 100% sensitivity to detect wakefulness. This study found no evidence for any substantial difference in performance between ages one and 13 years. If BIS is used in children to detect wakefulness occurring with lightening of anaesthesia, then this study suggests that if the BIS is maintained below 50 then wakefulness is unlikely to have occurred.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19115649/

However, the effect of caudal DEX has not been evaluated before in children. This prospective randomized double-blinded study was designed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of caudal DEX with bupivacaine in providing pain relief over a 24-h period.
Sixty children (ASA status I) aged 1-6 years undergoing unilateral inguinal hernia repair/orchidopexy were allocated randomly to two groups (n = 30 each). Group B received a caudal injection of bupivacaine 2.5 mg/ml, 1 ml/kg; Group BD received the same dose of bupivacaine mixed with DEX 1 microg/kg during sevoflurane anesthesia. Processed electroencephalogram (bispectral index score), heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry and end-tidal sevoflurane were recorded every 5 min. The characteristics of emergence, objective pain score, sedation score and quality of sleep were recorded post-operatively. Duration of analgesia and requirement for additional analgesics were noted.
The end-tidal sevoflurane concentration and the incidence of agitation were significantly lower in the BD group (P < 0.05). The duration of analgesia was significantly longer (P < 0.001) and the total consumption of rescue analgesic was significantly lower in Group BD compared with Group B (P < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in hemodynamics between both groups. However, group BD had better quality of sleep and a prolonged duration of sedation (P < 0.05).
Caudal DEX seems to be a promising adjunct to provide excellent analgesia without side effects over a 24-h period. It has the advantage of keeping the patients calm for a prolonged time.

Post hoc analysis of a prospectively observational cohort study.
Medical intensive care units of a tertiary care, university-based medical center.
A total of 125 mechanically ventilated, adult, critically ill patients.
A validated arousal scale (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) was used to measure sedation level, and the bispectral index monitor was used to capture electroencephalogram data.

As in recent studies attempting to correlate frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements with clinical evaluations of sedative efficacy, there is considerable overlap in numerical EEG values and different clinical levels of sedation. This precludes the use of these monitors for monitoring or titrating sedation in the critically ill. Despite many attempts, no study has yet presented data showing improved outcome with the use of EEG monitors in ICU sedation. Meanwhile, clinical sedation protocols have emerged, improving important endpoints in critically ill patients needing sedation. A major underlying problem in applying EEG monitors in the ICU is that they have been developed for measuring anesthetic depth and the related risk of recall, rather than the acknowledged endpoints of sedation, namely reduction of anxiety and discomfort. Until an 'objective' monitor is developed to measure the degree of such symptoms, physicians should continue treating patients and not numbers.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18983711/

The authors examined the response of BIS and PSI to sevoflurane anesthesia.
In 22 patients, sevoflurane anesthesia was induced by inhalation with a tight-fitting facemask and was maintained via a laryngeal mask. Sevoflurane concentrations were increased until burst suppression occurred and subsequently decreased until BIS recovered to values above 60. This procedure was repeated twice until patients underwent intubation for subsequent surgery. End-tidal sevoflurane concentrations, BIS, and PSI were recorded simultaneously. The performance of PSI and BIS to predict the estimated sevoflurane effect site concentration, as derived from simultaneous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, was compared by determination coefficients (rho(2)) and prediction probabilities (P(K)).
A significant (P < 0.001) correlation between BIS and PSI was found (r(2) = 0.75), and a close sigmoid relation between sevoflurane effect site concentration and both BIS (rho(2) = 0.84 +/- 0.09) and PSI (rho(2) = 0.85 +/- 0.15) was observed. The maximum sevoflurane electroencephalographic effect resulted in PSI values (1.3 +/- 4.3) that were significantly (P = 0.019) lower than BIS values (7.9 +/- 12.1), and the effect site efflux constant k(e0) was significantly smaller (P = 0.001) for PSI (0.13 +/- 0.08 min(-1)) than for BIS (0.24 +/- 0.15 min(-1)). The probability of BIS (P(K) = 0.80 +/- 0.11) to predict sevoflurane effect site concentration did not differ (P = 0.76) from that of PSI (P(K) = 0.79 +/- 0.09).
The BIS reacted faster to changes in sevoflurane concentrations, whereas the PSI made better use of the predefined index range.

Using an intraoperative wake-up test, we compared the performance of both indices in distinguishing different hypnotic states, as evaluated by the University of Michigan Sedation Scale, in children and adolescents during propofol-remifentanil anesthesia for scoliosis surgery. Postoperative explicit recall was also evaluated.
Twenty patients (aged 10-20 yr) were enrolled. Prediction probabilities were calculated for induction, wake-up test, and emergence. BIS and cAAI were compared at the start of the wake-up test, at purposeful movement to command, and after the patient was reanesthetized. During the wake-up test, patients were instructed to remember a color, and were then interviewed for explicit recall.
Prediction probabilities of BIS and cAAI for induction were 0.82 and 0.63 (P < 0.001), for the wake-up test, 0.78 and 0.79 (P < 0.001), and 0.74 and 0.78 for emergence (P < 0.001). During the wake-up test, a significant increase in mean BIS and cAAI (P < 0.05) was demonstrated at purposeful movement, followed by a significant decline after reintroduction of anesthesia.
During induction, BIS performed better than cAAI.

The Bispectral Index (BIS) is derived from EEG and considers cortical silence. We sought to determine whether a BIS range could predict a specific burst-suppression pattern.
Eleven TBI patients treated with barbiturate were included prospectively. EEG was recorded daily for 1 h. Every 5 min, the number of bursts and the suppression ratio (suppression ratio from EEG [SR(EEG)]: percentage of last 60 s in cortical silence) was calculated for 1 min on the raw EEG and compared to concomitant data from the BIS-XP (BIS and suppression ratio [SR(BIS)]). The optimal level of barbiturate coma was defined as 2-5 bursts/min in the EEG. A BIS range predictive of optimal level was determined from all data and its accuracy was studied for each examination.
Agreement between SR(EEG) and SR(BIS) was high (interclass correlation coefficient 0.94 [95% confidence interval: 0.90-0.96]). There was a significant association between SR(EEG) and BIS. Significant disagreements were observed in some examinations. The best accuracy to predict optimal pattern was obtained with a BIS range from 6 to 15.
The relationship between BIS and SR(EEG) was high in TBI patients treated with barbiturates. The rate of barbiturate infusion might be decreased if BIS is <6 or increased if BIS is >15. Correspondence between BIS and suppression pattern should periodically be checked by observation of the EEG analogical signal (as displayed by BIS-XP).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18931232/

We sought to quantify and compare the dynamic profile of sevoflurane's effect measured with the cerebral state index (CSI) and the bispectral index (BIS) in children.
Fifteen healthy children, aged 3-15 yr, scheduled to undergo minor surgery were prospectively studied. During the simultaneous recording of CSI and BIS, the sevoflurane vaporizer was set at 6 vol % for 5 min and then decreased. End-tidal concentrations (C(ET)) were measured. The C(ET)-sevoflurane effect-site concentration equilibration and pharmacodynamics were modeled. Goodness of fit between models was compared. Data are typical value (coefficient of variation).
Within the anesthetic depth range studied, the rate of change of sevoflurane's effect expressed as the effect-site equilibration half-life (t(1/2) k(e0)) was slower with the CSI [2.0 (14) min] than with BIS [1.2 (53) min] (P < 0.05). The estimated baseline effect of BIS and CSI before sevoflurane administration (E(0)) was 84 (39) for CSI and 87 (7) for BIS (NS). The sensitivity to sevoflurane hypnotic effect expressed in the C(50) [steady-state C(ET) eliciting half of the maximum response (E(max))] was 2.1 (68) % with CSI and 2.1 (16)% with BIS (NS). The E(max) with CSI 45 (0) was higher than that with BIS 27 (39) (P < 0.05). The population prediction error was significantly better for BIS (-0.7 +/- 26.9) than for CSI (-3.0 +/- 178.6) (P < 0.05).
In children, the t(1/2) k(e0) of sevoflurane and the pharmacodynamics of sevoflurane were quantified and the results were entirely dependent on the monitor used to measure its hypnotic effect. Within the anesthetic depth range studied, the rate of change of sevoflurane's effect was slower with the CSI. To adequately guide sevoflurane administration with these monitors in children, these differences should be considered.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18931214/

The EEG waveform can be described as a sequence of ordinal patterns. The permutation entropy (PE) describes the relative occurrence of each of these patterns. It is high ( approximately 1.0) when the signal has predominantly high frequencies and low ( approximately 0.4) when the signal consists of only low frequencies. The response of the PE to various computer-generated EEG-like waveforms was assessed. A composite PE index (CPEI) was developed, which was the sum of two simple PEs and included a small measurement-noise threshold (0.5 microV). We also applied the CPEI to two small pilot EEG data sets from patients receiving sevoflurane (n=21) or propofol (n=9) anaesthesia.
With minimal pre-processing or artifact rejection, the CPEI reliably tracked the anaesthetic-related EEG changes, namely loss of high frequencies, spindle-like waves, and delta waves. Using NONMEM, it was possible to construct adequate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models from the data. The CPEI was comparable with models derived using the bispectral index [BIS R(2)=0.88 (0.08) vs CPEI R(2)=0.91 (0.06) for the propofol data] and M-entropy indices [M-entropy R(2)=0.91 (0.06) vs CPEI R(2)=0.87 (0.09) for the sevoflurane data].

The objective of this investigation was to develop consensus for such criteria regarding the identification of three ventilatory events: disconnection or significant leak in the anesthesia circuit, decreased lung compliance or increased resistance, and anesthetic overdose from inhaled anesthetics.
We individually administered a structured interview to five expert anesthesiologists to gain insight into the cognitive processes used by clinicians to diagnose ventilatory events and to determine the common heuristics (rules of thumb) used in clinical practice. We then used common themes, identified from analysis of the structured interviews, to generate questions for a series of web-based questionnaires. Using a modified Delphi technique, iterative questionnaire administration facilitated rapid consensus development on the thresholds for the specific rules used to identify ventilatory events.
A threshold for 75% agreement was described for each scenario in a healthy ventilated adult. A disconnection or significant leak in the anesthesia circuit is diagnosed with peak airway pressure (< 5 cm H2O or change of 15 cm H2O), ETCO2 (0 mmHg, 40% drop, or value below 10 mmHg for a duration of 20 sec), and inspired-expired volume difference (300 mL). Increased resistance or decreased lung compliance is diagnosed with high peak airway pressure (40 cm H2O or a 20 cm H2O change), asymmetry of capnogram, and changes in measured compliance or resistance. Anesthetic overdose from inhaled anesthetics is diagnosed with high end-tidal anesthetic agent concentration (2 MAC in a patient less than 60 yr of age or 1.75 MAC in a patient over 60 yr of age), low systolic blood pressure (below 60 mmHg), and low modified electroencephalogram (bispectral index or entropy).

By evaluating sevoflurane-induced loss of consciousness in the presence of low brain concentrations of N2O in 38 elective surgical patients, N2O was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the input the frontal cortex received from other cortical and subcortical areas.

However, neuronal oscillating properties including the thalamocortical network during hyperventilation have not been elucidated. To assess these features provoked by hyperventilation, the present study examined quadratic phase coupling features by means of bicoherence analysis.
Twenty-two patients were anaesthetized using sevoflurane 1.5% combined with remifentanil or epidural anaesthesia. After a stable normocapnic period, hypocapnia was induced by hyperventilation, and the raw EEG signals were collected. Bispectral analysis (bicoherence) and power spectrum analysis were performed before and after hypocapnia.
Mean (sd) peak bicoherence in the delta- area increased from 35.6 (10.9)% during normocapnia to 43.8 (10.9)% during hypocapnia (P<0.05), whereas mean (sd) peak bicoherence in the alpha area decreased from 42.8 (14.4)% during normocapnia to 37.5 (12.3)% during hypocapnia (P<0.05). Normalized power in the delta- frequencies on the power spectrum increased from 60.2 (13.1)% to 72.5 (12.7)% (P<0.05). Bispectral index and spectral edge frequency changed from 45.9 (7.0) to 40.1 (5.6) (P<0.05) and from 15.0 (2.3) to 14.0 (2.5) Hz (P<0.05), respectively. No significant differences in these values were observed between the two types of anaesthesia.

After ethical committee approval and written patient consent, data from 35 patients [31 males, four females, age 55 (10) yr] were recorded during general anaesthesia for elective cardiac bypass surgery. All patients were induced with sevoflurane 8%, until the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS) scale level 1 was reached, and then was set at a 1% end-tidal sevoflurane concentration. Subsequently, remifentanil and atracurium were administered, the trachea was intubated, and the procedure continued as usual. To assess accuracy, the prediction probability (Pk) was calculated both during induction and during maintenance.
The Pk values [mean (se)] for IoC, BIS, and CSI during induction were 0.90 (0.01), 0.90 (0.01), and 0.88 (0.01), respectively, whereas the corresponding Pk values during maintenance were 0.95 (0.01), 0.94 (0.01), and 0.60 (0.01).
The three indices performed equally well during the induction phase and were able to predict the level of consciousness of the patients satisfactorily. During maintenance, the IoC and the BIS showed good agreement with the clinical signs. The CSI was significantly influenced by the administration of atracurium; therefore, the agreement with the OAAS scale during the maintenance phase was significantly less for CSI than for IoC and BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18723856/

The objective of the present study was to observe correlation between an established subjective measure, the Ramsay Sedation Scale, and two objective tools for monitoring critically ill patients: the Bispectral Index (BIS) and auditory evoked potential. Ninety patients undergoing major surgery scheduled for postoperative mechanical ventilation and continuous sedation with propofol and fentanyl were selected. Electrodes for determining BIS and auditory evoked potential were placed on the foreheads of all patients according to manufacturer's specifications at least six hours after patients' arrival at the intensive care unit. Ramsay Sedation Scale, BIS, signal quality index, composite A-line autoregressive index (AAI) and electromyographic activities were recorded every five minutes for 30 minutes. BIS and AAI showed good correlation amongst readings (r(s)=0.697, P <0.01). Both were significantly influenced by electromyographic activities (BIS, r(s)=0.735, P <0.01; AAI, r(s)=0.856, P <0.01). Comparison of BIS and AAI revealed an acceptable correlation between electroencephalogram variables and the Ramsay Sedation Scale (BIS, tau=-0.689; AAI, tau=-0.621; P <0.01). In conclusion, the auditory evoked potential and BIS monitors revealed an acceptable correlation with the Ramsay Sedation Scale. However, the BIS and auditory evoked potential monitors do not perform adequately as a substitute in the assessment of sedated intensive care unit patients.

In this study, I examined the effects, of AEP click sounds on the BIS, and also on the response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE) of the entropy monitor.
Forty patients aged 40-70 yr and scheduled for surgery of lower extremities under spinal anesthesia were anesthetized with 0.5% bupivacaine or tetracaine. Patients were sedated with midazolam 1 mg followed by propofol infusion started at 1 mg.kg(-1).h(-1). Propofol infusion was controlled to keep BIS or SE at 80, 60, or 40 for several minutes, and then click sounds (65 dB) of the AEP were given for 60 s. The changes in BIS, RE, and SE were observed continuously for 60 s after the click sounds had stopped.
BIS, SE, and RE significantly increased during the click sounds. The longest duration of increase was at BIS or SE 60.
AEP monitor click sounds transiently increased the simultaneously measured BIS, RE, and SE during different levels of sedation by propofol infusion during spinal anesthesia. Therefore, the effects of the click sounds should be considered when these monitors are used simultaneously in the same patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18633033/

During a period of 12 months, 54 BDs were registered in our unit, of which 28 were included in the organ donation protocol; 24 fulfilled the requirements of our retrospective observational study. Continuous BIS monitoring was performed using an XP BIS monitor and BIS Quatro sensor evaluating the BIS and the suppression ratio (SR). In almost all cases, sonographic monitoring with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) was performed every 8 to 12 hours until the diagnosis of BD.
We detected a gradual decrease in BIS and increase in SR when the patients underwent clinical progression to BD. At the moment of BD diagnosis, all cases showed BIS 0 and SR 100. In 9 cases the follow-up TCD showed a BD pattern, moments before a BIS 0 and SR 100 appeared. In 18 cases, at the moment of BIS 0/SR 100, TCD showed BD. In all 24 cases, BD diagnosis was confirmed by means of neurological examination and electroencephalogram (EEG).
BIS monitoring is a continuous, simple method that is easy to interpret. It can help in clinical evolution and the decision of the BD moment. In our series, cerebral circulatory cessation (TCD) preceded BIS 0 and SR 100 values.

Loss of consciousness (LOC) was repetitively induced by bolus injections of propofol in 24 patients undergoing elective surgery in spinal anaesthesia. SSEP and the BIS were recorded during LOC and recovery of consciousness (ROC). The level of consciousness was clinically assessed by the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale. Propofol venous plasma concentrations were measured simultaneously.
At LOC, all SSEPs latency components were prolonged (P<0.001), whereas amplitudes of the components > or = 45 ms were smaller (P=0.008) and the BIS values were lower (P<0.001). None of the EEG variables regained baseline levels during ROC. Regression analyses revealed that the SSEP components (five latencies and five amplitudes) explained 33% of the variance when predicting ROC; the BIS explained 12%. The combination of SSEP and BIS explained 37% of variance in this patient sample. Propofol venous plasma concentration was 1.2 (0.8) microg ml(-1) during LOC and 0.4 (0.5) microg ml(-1) during ROC.
The present results indicate the usefulness of combining variables of the evoked and spontaneous EEG to measure different levels of consciousness, because the SSEP provide additional information beyond the BIS. Inter-individual variability of all the EEG variables limits their predictive potency of ROC after propofol infusion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18587138/

Bispectral (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA, version XP) and Narcotrend (NCT, MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany, Version 4.0) indices were used as an electroencephalographic measure of desflurane drug effect.
With IRB approval and informed consent we investigated 20 adult patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy. At least 45 minutes after induction of general anaesthesia, end-tidal concentrations of desflurane was varied between 3 and 10 vol%. To evaluate the relationship between concentrations and EEG indices, two different pharmacodynamic models were applied: A conventional model based on a single sigmoidal curve, and a novel model based on two sigmoidal curves for BIS and NCT values with and without burst suppression. The parameters of the models were estimated by NONMEM V (GloboMax, Hanover, USA) by minimizing log likelihood. Statistical significance between the two models was calculated by the likelihood ratio test.
The maximum end-tidal desflurane concentration during the two concentrations ramps was 10.0 +/- 1.4 vol%. The mean BIS and NCT values decreased significantly but slightly with increasing end-tidal desflurane concentrations between 4 and 8 vol%. Therefore a two sigmoidal curves PK/PD model including a plateau describes the effects of desflurane on BIS and Narcotrend better than a single sigmoidal curve model. The difference between the log likelihood values of the new PK/PD model with two connected sigmoidal curves and the classical E (max )model with one sigmoidal curve is 634 (P < 0.001) for the BIS monitor and 4089 (P < 0.001) for the NCT.

Use of the bispectral index (BIS), developed from a processed electroencephalogram, has been reported to decrease the incidence of anesthesia awareness when the BIS value is maintained below 60. In this trial, we sought to determine whether a BIS-based protocol is better than a protocol based on a measurement of end-tidal anesthetic gas (ETAG) for decreasing anesthesia awareness in patients at high risk for this complication.
We randomly assigned 2000 patients to BIS-guided anesthesia (target BIS range, 40 to 60) or ETAG-guided anesthesia (target ETAG range, 0.7 to 1.3 minimum alveolar concentration [MAC]). Postoperatively, patients were assessed for anesthesia awareness at three intervals (0 to 24 hours, 24 to 72 hours, and 30 days after extubation).
We assessed 967 and 974 patients from the BIS and ETAG groups, respectively. Two cases of definite anesthesia awareness occurred in each group (absolute difference, 0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.56 to 0.57%). The BIS value was greater than 60 in one case of definite anesthesia awareness, and the ETAG concentrations were less than 0.7 MAC in three cases.

We did not reproduce the results of previous studies that reported a lower incidence of anesthesia awareness with BIS monitoring, and the use of the BIS protocol was not associated with reduced administration of volatile anesthetic gases.

Sixteen patients underwent beating heart valve replacement with normothermic bypass without cross-clamping the aorta, 17 patients underwent the same procedure with cross-clamping the aorta and retrograde coronary sinus perfusion, and the remaining 17 patients had conventional surgery with hypothermic bypass and cardioplegic arrest.
Two-channel electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded to assess changes in cerebral cortical synaptic activity and 95% spectral edge frequency values were recorded continuously. Bispectral monitoring was used to measure the depth of anesthesia. Blood flow rates in middle cerebral artery (MCA) were measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD). Reduction in spectral edge frequency (>50%) or bispectral index (BIS) (<20) or transcranial Doppler flow velocity (>50%) was detected in four patients in Group 1, five patients in Group 2, and three patients in Group 3. BIS or EEG values never reached zero, which indicates isoelectric silence during surgery. Gross neurological examinations were normal in all patients postoperatively.

The investigated parameters were the Narcotrend Index (NI), the Bispectral Index (BIS), and standard spectral and entropy parameters. Additionally, it was investigated whether the effect of a fixed dosage of propofol on the attained depth of hypnosis during induction of anaesthesia is different in male and female patients.
Standardized inductions of anaesthesia in 10 male and 10 female patients (ASA status I or II, 15-75 years) were analysed. All patients received 4 mg propofol/kg over 6 min followed by 4 mg/kg/h. For analgesia, patients received 0.3 microg/kg/min remifentanil starting 2 min before propofol application. For EEG monitoring, the Narcotrend and the Aspect A-2,000 Bispectral Index monitor were used simultaneously. Data from start of propofol injection until 1 min after the end of the induction period (420 s) were used for statistical analysis. EEG parameters were evaluated every 10 s.
The Narcotrend Index and the Bispectral Index had the highest mean correlations with the calculated propofol effect-site concentration and were able to distinguish stages from the awake state or the near awake state and stages of deep hypnosis. On the Narcotrend scale, more data points are available for levels of anaesthesia with relevance for maintenance of anaesthesia. The BIS values at the first occurrence of burst suppression were significantly higher than the corresponding NI values. During induction of anaesthesia, the same dosages of propofol (per kg body weight) given to men and women did not show different effects on the EEG.
NI and BIS are superior to spectral and entropy parameters in describing changes of propofol concentration during induction of propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18288579/

The performance of BIS, State Entropy, and Response Entropy were evaluated with prediction probability, sensitivity, and specificity analyses. The power spectrum of the raw electroencephalogram signal was calculated.
The mean (SD) xenon concentration during anesthesia was 66.4% (2.4%). BIS, State Entropy, and Response Entropy demonstrated low prediction probability values at loss of response (0.455, 0.656, and 0.619) but 1 min after that the values were high (0.804, 0.941, and 0.929).

We simultaneously investigated the influence of neuromuscular block on the bispectral index, a measure of hypnosis during general anaesthesia, and on the electroencephalogram. Patients were anaesthetized with sevoflurane. Noxious tetanic electrical stimulation was applied on two occasions: before and after profound neuromuscular block achieved with rocuronium. Neuromuscular block significantly attenuated the effect from noxious stimulation on electroencephalogram power and synchrony in the gamma band (P<0.05), and the corresponding effect on bispectral index (P<0.02).

Fifty children aged from 3 to 15 yr were included. Anaesthesia was induced using a target-controlled infusion of propofol with the Kataria pharmacokinetic model together with a bolus of remifentanil followed by a continuous infusion rate at 0.2 microg kg(-1) min(-1). Target plasma propofol concentration was initially stabilized to 6 microg ml(-1) and continued for 6 min. The target was then decreased and stabilized to 4 microg ml(-1) and then to 2 microg ml(-1). BIS values, plasma propofol concentration, and EEG were continuously recorded. In order to explore the relationship between variations in propofol concentration and the EEG bispectrum, we used a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). Results are shown in median (range).
We found no statistical difference between BIS values with propofol 6 microg ml(-1) [23 (12-40)] and 4 microg ml(-1) [28 (9-67)]. At 2 microg ml(-1), BIS was significantly different [52 (24-71)], but a significant correlation between the age of children and BIS values was found (r2=0.66; P<0.01). There was little change in children's position between 6 and 4 microg ml(-1) in the structure model of the MCA. From 4 to 2 microg ml(-1), the position of children moved only on axis 2.

The authors developed a method for the quantification of epileptiform electroencephalographic activity during sevoflurane anesthesia.
Electroencephalographic data from 60 patients under sevoflurane mask induction were used in the analysis. Electroencephalographic data were visually classified. A novel electroencephalogram-derived quantity, wavelet subband entropy (WSE), was developed. WSE variables were calculated from different frequency bands. Performance of the WSE in detection and quantification of epileptiform electroencephalographic activity and the ability of the WSE to recognize misleading Bispectral Index readings caused by epileptiform activity were evaluated.
Two WSE variables were found to be sufficient for the quantification of epileptiform activity: WSE from the frequency bands 4-16 and 16-32 Hz. The lower frequency band was used for monophasic pattern monitoring, and the higher frequency band was used for spike activity monitoring. WSE values of the lower and higher bands followed the time evolution of epileptiform activity with prediction probabilities of 0.809 (SE, 0.007) and 0.804 (SE, 0.007), respectively. In deep anesthesia with epileptiform activity, WSE detected electroencephalographic patterns causing Bispectral Index readings greater than 60, with event sensitivity of 97.1%.
The developed method proved useful in detection and quantification of epileptiform electroencephalographic activity during sevoflurane anesthesia. In the future, it may improve the understanding of electroencephalogram-derived information by assisting in recognizing misleading readings of depth-of-anesthesia monitors. The method also may assist in minimizing the occurrence of epileptiform activity and seizures during sevoflurane anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18043061/

Since these two drugs interact, the administration rate of remifentanil is considered as an accessible disturbance in combination with the level of electromyography (EMG) that also interferes with the BIS signal. In order to tackle the high uncertainty present on the system, the predictive adaptive controller MUSMAR is used. The performance of the controller is illustrated by means of simulation with 45 patient individual adjusted models, which incorporate the effect of the drugs interaction on BIS.

The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of burst suppression EEG during propofol anaesthesia using scalp electrodes and depth electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus. Specifically, we describe the electrical fields of the three EEG patterns we have previously described: the sharp wave, the burst and the spindle.
We recorded the EEG of three Parkinson patients during propofol anaesthesia from the scalp electrodes and the depth electrode implanted in the subthalamic nucleus for treating parkinsonism.
(1) The slow waves of bursts recorded from all surface electrodes on scalp or neck with depth electrode reference are positive and have the highest amplitude in frontal electrodes, suggesting synchronous generation in the whole cerebral cortex. (2) The sharp wave and spindles have the highest amplitude at vertex. They are opposite in polarity in vertex and depth electrodes when referred to the neck electrode, suggesting generation in the sensorimotor cortex.
Recording simultaneously EEG from the depth and scalp electrodes shows that bursts and their slow wave oscillations are synchronous in the whole cortex while spindles and sharp waves are produced by the sensorimotor cortex. The amplitude of slow waves recorded with surface electrodes is equal to the difference of the wave at two electrodes and therefore only a small part of that generated by the cortex.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17995997/

Sixty children undergoing surgical anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil were enrolled. The performance of 33 single EEG variables and bispectral index (BIS) was assessed by simultaneous analysis of prediction probability (Pk) of Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Sedation Scores and their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Variables performing best in Pk and SNR analysis were selected as potential measures of arousal. Their performance was investigated in five age groups, 0-1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-8, and 8-13 yr.
Single EEG variables such as relative power from frequency bands 13-20 and 20-26 Hz, SEF95, and approximate entropy performed best with Pk>0.59 and SNR>5.50. The Pk and SNR of BIS were 0.71 and 15.76, respectively. Their performance was significantly better in children aged 1-13 yr than in 0-1 yr.
BIS may provide a measure of arousal during propofol anaesthesia in children, but its accuracy is less in infants younger than 12 months.

We compared the EEG response with tracheal intubation between young and elderly.
Sixty young (<40 yr) and elderly (>70 yr) patients were randomly allocated to one of the four groups. Anaesthesia was induced with 66% N(2)O and isoflurane in oxygen (Young-isoflurane and Elderly-isoflurane groups) or 66% N(2)O and sevoflurane in oxygen (Young-sevoflurane and Elderly-sevoflurane groups). Inhaled isoflurane and sevoflurane concentrations were gradually increased and the end-tidal concentrations were maintained at 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively. Tracheal intubation was performed 12 min after induction of anaesthesia.
There were significant differences in the overall changes in bispectral index (BIS) and 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) between young and elderly (P<0.001 for both), but not between patients receiving isoflurane and sevoflurane (P=0.4 and 0.3, respectively).

In sharp contrast, BIS and SEF95 remained unchanged in Elderly-isoflurane and Elderly-sevoflurane groups (P>0.7 for all). These results suggest that both BIS and SEF95 significantly decreased, despite the presence of increased sympathetic activity after tracheal intubation in young patients.

Barbiturates are used to lower intracranial pressure or to stop epileptiform activity, with the aim being to improve neurological outcome. Dosing of barbiturates is usually guided by the extent of induced burst-suppression pattern on the electroencephalogram (EEG). Dosing beyond the point of burst suppression may increase the risk for complications without offering further therapeutic benefit. For this reason, careful monitoring of EEG parameters is mandatory. A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of the bispectral index suppression ratio for monitoring barbiturate coma.
A prospective observational pilot study was performed at a paediatric (surgical) intensive care unit, including all children with barbiturate-induced coma after traumatic brain injury or GCSE. The BIS (Bispectral index) monitor expresses a suppression ratio, which represents the percentage of epochs per minute in which the EEG was suppressed. Suppression ratios from the BIS monitor were compared with suppression ratios of full-channel EEG as assessed by quantitative visual analysis.
Five patients with GCSE and three patients after traumatic brain injury (median age 11.6 years, range 4 months to 15 years) were included. In four patients the correlation between the suppression ratios of the BIS and EEG could be determined; the average correlation was 0.68. In two patients, suppression ratios were either high or low, with no intermediate values. This precluded determination of correlation values, as did the isoelectric EEG in a further two patients. In the latter patients, the mean +/- standard error BIS suppression ratio was 95 +/- 1.6.
Correlations between suppression ratios of the BIS and EEG were found to be only moderate. In particular, asymmetrical EEGs and EEGs with short bursts (less than 1 second) may result in aberrant BIS suppression ratios. The BIS monitor potentially aids monitoring of barbiturate-induced coma because it provides continuous data on EEG suppression between full EEG registrations, but it should be used with caution.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17897479/

This was an institutional review board-approved, prospective observational study of a convenience sample of patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) with the chief complaint of ethanol (ETOH) intoxication between July 19, 2003, and March 27, 2004. The AMS scale is a 9-point scale: -4 is unresponsive, 0 is normal examination, and +4 is extremely agitated. After ETOH was detected by breath analyzer, enrolled patients had a BIS monitor probe applied to their forehead. Baseline BAC, BIS, and AMS scores were recorded independently of the patients' caregivers. Bispectral index and AMS scores were repeated every 20 minutes for 1 hour. The patient's diagnosis, disposition, (any) complications, and total time in department were recorded.
Ninety-eight patients were enrolled in the study. The median presenting AMS score was -1. The mean total time in department was 402.6 minutes (SD, 196.4; range, 246-906 minutes). The mean presenting BIS score was 77.6 (SD, 17.9; range, 26-98). The mean presenting BAC was 0.229 (SD, 0.07; range, 0.049-0.43). The mean BIS index varied from 59.6 +/- 16.9 for AMS scores of -4, to 96.3 +/- 2.7 for AMS scores of 0, to 90.5 +/- 4.9 for AMS scores of 4. The AMS scale correlated with the BIS scale (Spearman's rho = 0.67, P < or = .001), but did not correlate with BAC (Spearman's rho = -0.14, P = 0.15).
Changes in the AMS scale corresponded to changes in the BIS index score. A decreased level of awareness, as determined on the BIS index, was observed in patients who were either agitated or sedated by the AMS. We conclude that both agitated and sedated patients with ETOH intoxication show decreases in their level of awareness. Therefore, the AMS scale, which includes both agitation and sedation, is a valid measure of a patient's decreased level of awareness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17870474/

Sixty-one patients received 2.5 mg/kg propofol given as a bolus or as a 1-, 2-, or 3-min infusion. The Bispectral Index was used to monitor drug effect. Propofol predicted plasma concentration was calculated using a three-compartment model and the effect site concentration over time as the convolution between the predicted plasma concentration and the disposition function of the effect site concentration. The authors evaluated the influence of the infusion rate on the k(e0) by comparing the model with one k(e0) for all groups with models estimating different k(e0) values for each group. The authors also assessed the accuracy of two pharmacokinetic models after bolus injection.
The best model based was a fixed (Bispectral Index > or = 90) plus sigmoidal model (Bispectral Index < 90) with two values of k(e0), one for the bolus (t(1/2) k(e0) = 1.2 min) and one for the infusions (t(1/2) k(e0) = 2.2 min). However, the tested pharmacokinetic models poorly predicted the arterial concentrations in the first minutes after bolus injection. Simulations showed the requirement for two k(e0) values for bolus and infusion was mostly a compensation for the inaccurate prediction of arterial concentrations after a bolus.
Propofol plasma-effect site equilibration occurs more rapidly after a bolus than after rapid infusion, based on the electroencephalogram as a drug effect measure, mostly because of misspecification of the pharmacokinetic model in the first minutes after bolus.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17721240/

Comparison of performance with the BIS and spectral entropy.,British journal of anaesthesia,2007,"Barnard JP, Bennett C, Voss LJ, Sleigh JW","Unlike the other physiological waveforms monitored in anaesthesia, the EEG lacks a regularly repeating pattern, implying that it would be very difficult for an anaesthetist to obtain any useful information from the raw EEG. There are, however, clear changes in the EEG caused by GABA-ergic anaesthetic agents. The anaesthetized EEG still looks like a random waveform, but clearly a different random waveform from that seen when conscious.
The aim of this study was to assess how 40 anaesthetists would perform at interpreting intra-operative EEGs compared with two processed EEG (pEEG) monitors, BIS and entropy, after a short educational presentation. Short segments of EEGs were used from the pre-induction phase, the intra-operative phase with adequate surgical anaesthesia, and the transition phase between these two states.
While anaesthetists' performance varied widely, most could reliably differentiate an anaesthetized from a conscious EEG. Further, both humans (41% wrong) and machines (30% wrong) made mistakes. Unlike the anaesthetists, the pEEG monitors did not make a major error (i.e. producing a number in the conscious range (>85) when analysing an anaesthetized EEG or the converse error).
A brief PowerPoint presentation enables anaesthetists to recognize the effects on the EEG of GABA-ergic anaesthetic agents. In the clinical context, it remains likely that the combination of a pEEG monitor that clearly presents the EEG and a clinician who has a good, basic understanding of, and a willingness to look at, the raw EEG will result in more accurate interpretation of the intra-operative EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17652076/
17621599,Ketamine increases the frequency of electroencephalographic bicoherence peak on the alpha spindle area induced with propofol.,British journal of anaesthesia,2007,"Hayashi K, Tsuda N, Sawa T, Hagihira S","The reticular and thalamocortical system is known to play a prominent role in spindle wave activity, and the spindle wave is related to the sedative effects of anaesthetics. Recently, bispectral analysis of the EEG has been developed as a better method to indicate nonlinear regulation including the thalamocortical system linking to the cortical area. In the present study, in order to explore the interference of ketamine with the nonlinear regulation of the sub-cortical system, we examined the effect of ketamine on spindle alpha waves through the bispectral analysis.
The study included 21 patients. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained using a propofol-TCI system (target-controlled infusion, with target concentration 3.5 microg ml(-1)). An A-2000 BIS monitor was used and the raw EEG signals were collected via an RS232 interface on a personal computer. Bicoherence, the normalized bispectrum, and power spectrum were analysed before and after i.v. administration of 1 mg kg(-1) racemic ketamine.
Propofol caused alpha peaks in both power and bicoherence spectra, with average frequencies of 10.6 (SD 0.9) Hz and 10.7 (1.0) Hz, respectively. The addition of ketamine significantly shifted each peak to frequencies of 14.4 (1.4) Hz and 13.6 (1.5) Hz, respectively [P < 0.05, mean (SD)].
Ketamine shifted the alpha peaks of bicoherence induced by propofol to higher frequencies. This suggests that ketamine changes the alpha spindle rhythms through the modulation of the nonlinear sub-cortical reverberating network.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17621599/
17592349,Quantification of burst suppression and bispectral index with 2 different bolus doses of thiopentone sodium.,Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,2007,"Ramesh VJ, Umamaheswara Rao GS","Metabolic suppression caused by barbiturates is a major mechanism responsible for their cerebral protective potential. Maximal cerebral metabolic suppression is believed to coincide with electroencephalographic burst suppression. However, many neurosurgical procedures associated with cerebral ischemic threat are still performed in the absence of electroencephalogram monitoring, especially in developing nations. The present study was designed to assess the degree of burst suppression with 2 different doses of thiopentone sodium administered on the background of isoflurane anesthesia intraoperatively. Forty-one patients without any intracranial pathology undergoing elective spinal surgery under a general anesthetic consisting of N2O (60%) in O2 (40%) and isoflurane to maintain a bispectral index (BIS) value of 45 were randomized to receive a thiopentone bolus of either 3 or 5 mg/kg. BIS, burst suppression ratio (BSR), systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded before the bolus and every 15 seconds for first 2 minutes and every 30 seconds for another 8 minutes. During the 10-minute study period after the administration of thiopentone bolus, BIS values were significantly lower in the group that received thiopentone 5 mg/kg compared with the group that received thiopentone 3 mg/kg (P<0.02). BSR>25% was seen in 7 out of 21 patients in the 3 mg/kg group and 10 out of 20 patients in the 5 mg/kg group. There was a statistically insignificant prolongation of the duration of burst suppression with thiopentone 5 mg/kg [243 s (range 75 to 435 s)] compared with thiopentone 3 mg/kg [171 s (30 to 465 s)]. The number of patients who had a BSR >50% was higher among patients who received thiopentone 5 mg/kg as compared with those who received a dose of 3 mg/kg [9/20 vs. 3/21(P<0.02)]. We conclude that thiopentone in a bolus dose of 3 to 5 mg/kg produces only a short duration of incomplete burst suppression. Also, in this dose range, burst suppression does not occur consistently in all patients. The present data suggest that bolus doses of thiopentone in the range of 3 to 5 mg/kg may have very limited value in providing significant metabolic suppression required for intraoperative cerebral protection during temporary ischemic episodes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17592349/
17479028,Monitoring the anaesthetic depth in children - an update.,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2007,Davidson AJ,"There are several commercially available electroencephalogram-derived devices for monitoring anaesthesia depth. This article reviews all published studies describing their use in children; first assessing studies of performance in measuring anaesthesia depth in observational, physiological studies and then describing relevant outcome studies. There is also a brief discussion of why they might be useful, what physiological problems may arise and what the reader should be wary of in the methodology of these studies. The subject is approached from a clinical perspective.
There are several physiological studies suggesting that for older children the bispectral index, entropy, Narcotrend index, cerebral state index and A-line ARX index all change with induction of anaesthesia, and have reasonable correlations with doses of anaesthetic agent. There is consistent evidence that the performances are substantially poorer in infants. Some of these devices have been demonstrated to reduce anaesthesia drug consumption and hasten recovery in older children.
The bispectral index is the most widely studied, but at this stage there is no evidence to suggest any one device is substantially superior to any other. There may be a role emerging for their use in older children, but their use in infants cannot be supported.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17479028/

Some previous reports suggest the passive EEG does not reliably predict level of anesthesia in infants. The AAI-1.6 is a relatively new index derived from the AEP/2 monitor. It combines auditory evoked potentials and passive EEG parameters into a single index. This study aimed to assess the AAI-1.6 as a predictor of level of anesthesia in infants and children.
Four infants aged less than 1 year, and five older children aged between 2 and 11 years were enrolled. They all had uniform sevoflurane anesthesia for cardiac catheterization. The AAI-1.6 and bispectral index (BIS) were recorded after achieving equilibrium at 1.5%, 2% and 2.5% sevoflurane, and immediately prior to awakening. The prediction coefficient (Pk) for BIS and AAI-1.6 was calculated and compared within each age group.
The Pk for the AAI-1.6 was low in both 0-1 and 2-11 years age groups. In the 2-12 years group, the Pk for BIS was significantly higher than the Pk for the AAI-1.6 (Pk for BIS: 0.89, Pk for AAI-1.6: 0.53, P < 0.01). In contrast in the 0-1 year age group there was no evidence for a difference between the Pk for BIS and the Pk for the AAI-1.6 (Pk for BIS: 0.74, Pk for AAI-1.6: 0.53, P = 0.25).

In this study we compared heart rate variability (HRV) in unstimulated patients and stimulation-induced HRV at different levels of anaesthesia.
A total of 95 ASA I or II patients were randomly assigned to five groups (Group 1: BIS 45(5), remifentanil 1 ng ml(-1); Group 2: BIS 45(5), remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1); Group 3: BIS 45(5), remifentanil 4 ng ml(-1); Group 4: BIS 30(5), remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1); Group 5: BIS 60(5), remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1)). A time- and frequency-domain analysis of the RR interval (RRI) from the electrocardiogram was performed. HRV before induction, before and after a 5 s tetanic stimulus of the ulnar nerve, and before and after tracheal intubation was compared between groups, between stimuli, and between responders to intubation [systolic arterial pressure (SAP) increase >20 mm Hg, a maximal heart rate (HR) after intubation >90 min(-1) or both] and non-responders (anova).
Induction of anaesthesia significantly lowered HR and HRV. Mean RRI before stimulation was higher in G3 than in G1, G2, and G4 (P < 0.001), whereas the other HRV parameters were similar. Intubation induced a greater HRV response than tetanic stimulation. The mean RRI after intubation was lower in G3 compared with the other groups and the sd of the RRI after tetanic stimulation was lower in G3 compared with G5. Otherwise, unstimulated HRV and stimulation-induced HRV were similar in responders and non-responders.
HRV parameters discriminate between awake and general anaesthesia, are different after tracheal intubation and a 5 s ulnar nerve stimulation, but do not discriminate between different levels of haemodynamic responsiveness during surgical anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17468493/

Recently, bispectral index (BIS) derived from the frontal cortical electroencephalogram has been used frequently for quantifying the hypnotic component of anesthesia. The present study was designed to examine the BIS values produced by equi-MAC concentrations of halothane and isoflurane. In 34 patients undergoing spinal surgery, BIS and spectral edge frequency (SEF95) were recorded at 3 different concentrations of halothane and isoflurane--namely 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 MAC. The measurements were made both during wash-in and wash-out phases of the anesthetic agent. Eighteen patients received halothane and 16 received isoflurane. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, oxygen saturation, and end tidal carbon dioxide pressure values were not different between the 2 groups at various MAC concentrations of the anesthetic agents. BIS and SEF95 values decreased significantly with increasing concentrations of both the anesthetic agents (P<0.001). At any given MAC concentration of the anesthetic, BIS and SEF(95) values were significantly lower under isoflurane compared with halothane anesthesia both during wash-in and wash-out phases (P<0.001). For a given anesthetic agent, BIS values were comparable at equi-MAC concentrations during wash-in and wash-out phases. In conclusion, BIS values are significantly lower under isoflurane compared with halothane anesthesia at similar MAC concentrations.

This was a randomized, prospective study of adults undergoing procedural sedation (PS) with propofol for fracture or dislocation reduction in the ED between July 2003 and March 2004. Patients were randomized to a target sedation level of moderate or deep, using American Society of Anesthesiologists' definitions. Doses, vital signs, nasal end tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)), pulse oximetry, and bispectral EEG analysis (BIS) scores were recorded. Respiratory depression was defined as a change in ETCO(2) >10, an oxygen saturation of <90% at any time, or an absent ETCO(2) waveform at any time. After the procedure, patients were asked if they perceived any pain or had any recall of the procedure. Physicians were asked to rate the difficulty of completing the reduction using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Respiratory depression rates were compared with chi-square tests, BIS and VAS scores were compared with t tests. Seventy-five patients were enrolled, 39 randomized to the target of moderate PS and 36 to the target of deep PS. No significant complications were noted. There were 25/36 (69%) of the patients assigned to the deep sedation target group who actually achieved a deep level of sedation and 21/39 (54%) of the patients assigned to the moderate sedation target group who actually achieved a moderate level of sedation (p = 0.40). Respiratory depression was seen in 19/39 (49%) patients with the moderate PS target and 18/36 (50%) with the deep PS target (p = 0.91). The mean minimum recorded BIS score was 67.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 62.2-73.3) for the moderate PS target group and 59.2 (95% CI 55.1-64.2) for the deep PS target group (p = 0.03). There were 12/39 (31%) in the moderate PS target group and 4/36 (11%) in the deep PS target group who reported pain with or recall of the procedure (p = 0.04). The mean physician VAS for procedural difficulty was 34.0 (95% CI 23.7-44.3) for the moderate PS group and 28.8 (95% CI 18.4-39.2) for the deep PS group (p = 0.46). In this study, the assignment of a pre-procedural target sedation level of moderate or deep PS did not influence the level of sedation achieved, the rate of respiratory depression, the occurrence of complications, the time to return of baseline mental status, or the success of the procedure. It does not seem that the assignment of a pre-procedural target sedation level is an effective means of changing the outcome of ED PS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17394986/
17342965,Depth of anesthesia monitoring.,Anesthesiology clinics,2006,Bowdle TA,"Depth-of-anesthesia monitoring with EEG or EEG combined with mLAER is becoming widely used in anesthesia practice. Evidence shows that this monitoring improves outcome by reducing the incidence of intra-operative awareness while reducing the average amount of anesthesia that is administered, resulting in faster wake-up and recovery, and perhaps reduced nausea and vomiting. As with any monitoring device, there are limitations in the use of the monitors and the anesthesiologist must be able to interpret the data accordingly. The limitations include the following. The currently available monitoring algorithms do not account for all anesthetic drugs, including ketamine, nitrous oxide and halothane. EMG and other high-frequency electrical artifacts are common and interfere with EEG interpretation. Data processing time produces a lag in the computation of the depth-of-anesthesia monitoring index. Frequently the EEG effects of anesthetic drugs are not good predictors of movement in response to a surgical stimulus because the main site of action for anesthetic drugs to prevent movement is the spinal cord. The use of depth-of-anesthesia monitoring in children is not as well understood as in adults. Several monitoring devices are commercially available. The BIS monitor is the most thoroughly studied and most widely used, but the amount of information about other monitors is growing. In the future, depth-of-anesthesia monitoring will probably help in further refining and better understanding the process of administering anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17342965/

Forty adult patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I were randomly allocated to one of four groups. Group A: Patients breathed 8% sevoflurane in oxygen (8 l/min) via a prefilled circuit. End-tidal sevoflurane was maintained at 4%. Tracheal intubation was performed at the third minute after cisatracurium injection. Group B: The anesthesia protocol was similar, but a vital capacity technique was performed. Group C: Patients were anesthetized as in group A but were hyperventilated. Group D: Patients were anesthetized as in group A, but end-tidal sevoflurane was maintained at 2%. An electroencephalogram was recorded before and during induction up to 11 min after the start of induction. Statistical analysis was performed with Statview 5.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) for multivariate analysis.
Twelve patients experienced epileptiform discharges. Risk factors were female sex (odds ratio, 12.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-135), delay to the occurrence of beta waves (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.99), and end-tidal sevoflurane (odds ratio, 8.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-69). Epileptiform discharges were not associated with significant hemodynamic or Bispectral Index variations.
Induction with sevoflurane may result in epileptiform electroencephalographic activity. Only electroencephalographic monitoring allows the diagnosis. Risk factors are mainly female sex, short delay to onset of anesthesia, and high alveolar sevoflurane concentration. Induction with high sevoflurane concentration is controversial mainly in women.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17264717/

Forty five children aged 0-60 months were included in a prospective observational study. A direct comparison of the processed EEG variables Bispectral Index (BIS, version 3.4) and Narcotrend Index (NI, version 2.0AF) was to be achieved by simultaneous recording. The ability of these parameters to differentiate between various clinical states was evaluated by using the prediction probability (P(k)). Age-related effects on the BIS and NI were analyzed by dividing the children into three age groups: 0-6, 7-18 and 19-60 months.
The preanesthesia, conscious children were differentiated from anesthetized patients by the BIS and NI with no overlap (P(k) = 1.0). In the awake period the BIS was superior to the NI (P(k) to differentiate 'end of anesthesia' from 'awakening' was 0.97 vs 0.73 respectively; P = 0.002). Patients aged 7-18 months showed higher BIS and NI values in the course of anesthesia than the younger and older children (P = 0.001). On awakening, children aged 0-6 months showed the lowest mean BIS (n.s.) and NI (P = 0.006) values.

The study involved a pilot group of 10 patients undergoing routine carotid endarterectomy with shunt insertion under total intravenous anesthesia, and a study group of 26 additional patients. In all patients, rates of propofol and remifentanil providing a steady-state level of hypnosis (BIS: 40-60) were maintained constant throughout a recording period ranging from 3 minutes before CXC to shunt insertion. BIS was recorded throughout this period and the internal carotid backflow observed at the time of shunt insertion was graded as good, moderate, or poor. In addition, A-Line Autoregressive Index (AAI) and processed electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters were recorded in patients of the study group. All parameters were averaged over 1 minute before CXC, at CXC, 1, 2, and 3 minutes after CXC, and at shunt insertion. Statistical analysis was performed using chi2, Friedman, and Spearman correlation tests. For technical reasons, reliable AAI, BIS monitor-derived, and other processed EEG data were obtained in 24, 25, and 18 patients of the study group, respectively. During the first 3 minutes after CXC, BIS increased over 60 [68.8 (6.1)] in 47%, decreased below 40 [34.9 (4.4)] in 25%, and remained in the 40 to 60 range in 28% of all recruited patients. A BIS increase was more frequently observed in patients with moderate or poor than in those with good internal carotid backflow (78, 67, and 29%, respectively). It was significantly correlated to an increase in AAI and EEG amplitude, a decrease in EEG suppression ratio, and a shorter time between induction of anesthesia and CXC. A BIS decrease was significantly correlated to an increase in suppression ratio and a longer time between induction and CXC. In conclusion, during CXC under a constant level of intravenous anesthesia, BIS may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged. The paradoxical BIS increase could be related to borderline ischemia, a change in brain anesthetic agent concentration, or a change in the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance associated with a CXC-elicited painful stimulation. Caution should be used when interpreting BIS value during CXC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17198101/

State entropy differed significantly from 0 (isoelectric EEG) 28%, response entropy 29%, and BIS 68% of the total recorded time. The median values during the operation were state entropy 0.0, response entropy 0.0, and BIS 3.0.

Both entropy and BIS showed nonzero values due to artifacts after brain death diagnosis. BIS was more liable to artifacts than entropy. Neither of these indices are diagnostic tools, and care should be taken when interpreting EEG and EEG-derived indices in the evaluation of brain death.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17091243/

Electrophysiologic monitoring may offer an approach to solving this problem. Since electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to different sedation regimens vary, we assessed electrophysiologic responses to two sedative drug regimens in 10 healthy volunteers. Dexmedetomidine/remifentanil (dex/remi group) and midazolam/remifentanil (mida/remi group) were infused 7 days apart. Each combination of medications was given at stepwise intervals to reach Ramsay scores (RS) 2, 3, and 4. Resting EEG, bispectral index (BIS), and the N100 amplitudes of long-latency auditory-evoked potentials (ERP) were recorded at each level of sedation. During dex/remi, resting EEG was characterized by a recurrent high-power low-frequency pattern which became more pronounced at deeper levels of sedation. BIS Index decreased uniformly in only the dex/remi group (from 94 +/- 3 at baseline to 58 +/- 14 at RS 4) compared to the mida/remi group (from 94 +/- 2 to 76 +/- 10; P = 0.029 between groups). The ERP amplitudes decreased from 5.3 +/- 1.3 at baseline to 0.4 +/- 1.1 at RS 4 (P = 0.003) in only the mida/remi group. We conclude that ERPs in volunteers sedated with dex/remi, in contrast to mida/remi, indicate a cortical response to acoustic stimuli, even when sedation reaches deeper levels. Consequently, ERP can monitor sedation with midazolam but not with dexmedetomidine. The reverse is true for BIS.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17056949/

State Entropy (SE) reflects the level of hypnosis. Response Entropy (RE), computed from electroencephalogram and facial muscle activity, reflects the response to nociceptive stimulation. We evaluated the effect of rocuronium on Bispectral Index (BIS) and entropy responses to laryngoscopy.
A total of 25 patients were anaesthetized with propofol using a target-controlled infusion. At steady state, they randomly received 0.6 mg kg(-1) rocuronium (R) or saline (S).

At R/S+2, the RE-SE gradient was higher in Group S than in Group R. Laryngoscopy provoked an increase in BIS, RE and SE. Comparing R/S+2 and L0 values in Groups R and S, BIS increased from 43 (6) to 49 (8) and 42 (9) to 51 (15), SE increased from 43 (7) to 50 (8) and 41 (10) to 55 (12), and RE increased from 46 (8) to 54 (9) and 47 (12) to 66 (15), respectively.

Recent evidence suggests that BIS may also help in the detection of cerebral ischemia and prognostication of outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study was designed to investigate the correlation between Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and BIS in mild and moderate head injury.
In 29 patients with mild (GCS 13-15) and moderate (GCS 9-12) head injuries who underwent craniotomy, GCS and BIS were measured before surgery, after surgery and once a day for the first 10 days.
A significant correlation was found between GCS and BIS in the data sets from all the patients (r = 0.67; p < 0.001). Mean BIS values increased with increasing GCS scores. However, the scatter of BIS values for any GCS score was high limiting the value of BIS in predicting GCS. Mean BIS values were significantly different between mild and moderate head injuries [65.7 +/- 16.1 vs. 85.7 +/- 6.1, p = 0.006].
In patients with mild and moderate head injury, significant correlation exists between GCS and BIS. But the high degree of scatter of BIS values for any given GCS score limits its use as a monitor of depth of coma in TBI. Further studies are required to understand the relation between BIS algorithm and cerebral electrical activity following TBI to define the role of BIS as an electrophysiological correlate of consciousness in TBI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16964535/

In the present study we evaluated the relationship between EEG bicoherence and sevoflurane concentration. Sixteen ASA physical status I-II patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were enrolled in the study. Anesthesia was induced with 5% sevoflurane and maintained with sevoflurane and oxygen (50%). Just before surgery, IV fentanyl (2 microg/kg) was given and then continuously infused (2 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)). Using software we developed, EEG bicoherence, BIS, and 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) were recorded at end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations of 0.5%, 0.8%, 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.3%. Under light anesthesia, EEG bicoherence values were low. With increasing sevoflurane concentrations, 2 peaks of bicoherence emerged along the diagonal line (f1 = f2). Both the first (at around 4 Hz) and second (at around 10 Hz) grew higher (37.7% +/- 7.5% and 35.1% +/- 9.0%, respectively) as the sevoflurane concentration increased to 1.4%. However, the first peak leveled off whereas the second tended to decrease slightly with further increases in sevoflurane concentration. The BIS value decreased as the sevoflurane concentration increased and leveled off at 1.4% and higher concentrations of sevoflurane. The SEF 95 also decreased as the sevoflurane concentration increased up to 2.3%. Thus the distribution pattern of the two bicoherence peaks is likely to be better than BIS of the anesthetic effect of sevoflurane during surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16931674/
16837167,The spectrum of benign infantile seizures.,Epilepsy research,2006,"Specchio N, Vigevano F","Benign epilepsies during infancy are a wide topic, which needs both clinical and nosological clarifications. Already in 1963 Fukuyama reported patients with seizures during infancy with a benign outcome. In the late 80s and early 90s, Watanabe reported series of infants with complex partial seizures or partial seizures with secondary generalization, with a normal development before onset and a benign outcome. In the same years Vigevano focused on familial cases: he described several families with seizures with onset around the 6-month of age, and autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. To define this condition, he coined the term ""benign familial infantile seizures"" (BFIS). Afterwards, studying families with this phenotype, loci on chromosomes 19, 16 and 2 responsible for BFIS were detected. Similar loci were found in families affected by BFIS and subsequent choreoathetosis, and BFIS associated with familial hemiplegic migraine. In most recent years a new form of benign epilepsy has been proposed, with an intermediate onset between the neonatal and infantile age, which was defined with the term benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures (BFNIS). This condition could have some clinical and genetic features overlapping with BFIS. Seizures with a benign outcome have been reported also in infants during episode of mild gastroenteritis (BIS with MG) frequently with positive Rotavirus antigen. Lastly, sleep EEG abnormalities have been reported in children with a peculiar form of epilepsy by Capovilla, who defined this condition as benign infantile focal epilepsy with midline spikes and waves during sleep (BIMSE). Some of these entities have been included in the last classification proposed by the ILAE and have been differentiated in familial and non-familial forms. The aim of this review is to describe these entities, discuss their nosological aspects, pointing out the similarities and differences with benign neonatal seizures and benign focal epilepsies appearing later in life such as early-onset benign occipital seizure susceptibility syndrome (EBOSS), or benign epilepsy of childhood with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16837167/

Forty patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric banding were randomly assigned to receive either fentanyl or dexmedetomidine infusion, with desflurane concentration adjusted to maintain RE at 45. During anesthesia the average RE and BIS was determined in each patient and the RE-BIS difference plotted as a function of RE every 10 seconds. Fifteen of 40 patients showed activation of RE above 60 during surgery. In these patients RE, BIS and the electromyogram (EMG) were evaluated for the period 10 minutes before and including the peak change in RE.
In fentanyl and dexmedetomidine treated patients the average RE was 44-47 with no statistical difference between anesthesia groups or between RE and BIS. In each patient there was a linear relationship between the RE-BIS difference and RE during anesthesia. RE and BIS were similar at a level of 41-44 and RE showed a greater range at higher and lower values compared to BIS. When RE activation was identified during surgery in 15 patients, it was associated with an increase in BIS and EMG.
Within the range of 41-44, RE and BIS are equal but the gain of RE is 0.5 greater than BIS with deeper or lighter anesthesia. This is not likely due to increased smoothing with BIS.

Levels of sedation were assessed using the Bispectral Index (BIS) and the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (MOAAS). EEG-measurements were performed during wakefulness, deep propofol sedation (MOAAS 2-3, mean BIS=68), and a recovery period. Between deep sedation and recovery period, the infusion rate of propofol was increased to achieve unconsciousness (MOAAS 0-1, mean BIS=35); EEG measurements of recovery period were performed after subjects regained consciousness.
During deep sedation, the physical MMN was markedly reduced, but still significant. No ERAN was observed in this level. A clear P3a was elicited during deep sedation by those deviants, which were task-relevant during the awake state. As soon as subjects regained consciousness during the recovery period, a normal MMN was elicited. By contrast, the P3a was absent in the recovery period, and the P3b was markedly reduced.
Results indicate that the auditory sensory memory (as indexed by the physical MMN) is still active, although strongly reduced, during deep sedation (MOAAS 2-3). The presence of the P3a indicates that attention-related processes are still operating during this level. Processes of syntactic analysis appear to be abolished during deep sedation. After propofol-induced anesthesia, the auditory sensory memory appears to operate normal as soon as subjects regain consciousness, whereas the attention-related processes indexed by P3a and P3b are markedly impaired.
Results inform about effects of sedative drugs on auditory and attention-related mechanisms. The findings are important because these mechanisms are prerequisites for auditory awareness, auditory learning and memory, as well as language perception during anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16807099/

Recently, devices that estimate depth of consciousness have been introduced in an attempt to better titrate anesthesia, however the effect of N(2)O on these monitors is unclear.
General anesthesia was induced and titrated to maintain normal blood pressure and pulse in healthy adults. Data were collected in three 10 minute intervals (Sevo, Sevo + N(2)O, Sevo). In Phase A, sevoflurane concentration was held constant during the N(2)O trial in 60 subjects monitored with either BIS, PSI, or Entropy. In Phase B, sevoflurane concentration was reduced as N(2)O was added, maintaining a constant overall ""MAC"" in 20 subjects monitored concurrently with BIS and Entropy. Sample size for both phases was designed to detect a 10 unit change in measure of processed EEG with alpha = .05 and statistical power = .80.
In Phase A, supplementing sevoflurane with > 65% N(2)O increased MAC from 1.3 +/- 0.05 to 2.2 +/- 0.10, but did not significantly alter BIS nor PSI (p-value for differential MAC is < 0.05). Entropy, however, dropped significantly, with a change in state entropy (SE) from 31.1 +/- 7.3 to 18.9 +/- 3.7 and a corresponding rise when N(2)O was discontinued. In Phase B, supplementing sevoflurane with > 65% N(2)O with a concomitant reduction in sevoflurane resulted in an increase in both BIS (from 34 +/- 5 to 53.9 +/- 11.5) and SE (from 32 +/- 8.2 to 55.4 +/- 21.3).
Supplementing sevoflurane with > 65% N(2)O did not result in a significant change in either BIS or PSI when sevoflurane concentration was kept constant.

16749571,The bispectral index system in pediatrics--is it related to the end-tidal concentration of inhalation anesthetics?,Middle East journal of anaesthesiology,2006,Samarkandi AH,"BACKGROUND AND GOAL OF STUDY: Bispectral Index (BIS) has been used in adults to measure depth of anesthesia using various protocols. Though less investigated in children, there is growing evidence that bispectral index seems adequately calibrated for monitoring the depth of isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia in pediatric patients. A range of BIS scores (40-60) has been seen to be an indicator for an acceptable level of hypnosis and anesthesia. Davidson and Czarnecki have reported that, at an end-tidal concentration of 1 MAC, the BIS for halothane was significantly greater than isoflurane (56.5 +/- 8.1 vs. 35.9 +/- 8.5). The explanation given is the fact that the volume concentration of the MAC value is inversely related to the BIS value. Accordingly, it is expected that the BIS value at 1 MAC of desflurane must be less than halothane and isoflurane.
This is a clinical cross-over, prospective, randomized double blinded study. 90 pediatric patients scheduled for below umbilical surgery, under general and caudal analgesia, were allocated into 4 study groups. The BIS values at a relatively equipotent doses of the previously mentioned agents were compared with each other in the same group and between other groups.
At a relatively equipotent doses, the mean BIS value for halothane {60.4 +/- 5.6} was significantly higher than isoflurane {45.5 +/- 9.2} and desflurane {38.5 +/- 9.2} P<0.001). Equivalent end-tidal doses of different inhalational anesthetics do not necessarily have the same effects on cortical and sub-cortical functions and consequently on EEG.
The use of a relatively equipotent end-tidal concentration of different inhalational agents may result in different BIS values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16749571/

Clinical anaesthesiology,2006,"Tonner PH, Paris A, Scholz J","Sedation and analgesia are important components of care for critically ill patients. Avoiding over-as well as undersedation is of utmost importance as both states carry considerable risks and may influence outcome. The management of sedation has changed dramatically over the past two decades from providing a dosage level by which the patient was kept in a deep stage of anaesthesia to a current dosing strategy allowing the administration of drugs in line with individual need, resulting in most cases in a slightly sedated, cooperative patient. The importance of monitoring the level of sedation and analgesia has only recently been realised. Most importantly, regularly determining the appropriate level of sedation and analgesia as well as monitoring the desired level of sedation will help to minimise the adverse effects of sedation. Clinical sedation scales are, however, subjective, and most lack proper validation. Thus, an objective measure of sedation, such as the use of processed electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters is desirable. Processed EEG algorithms such as the bispectral index were initially introduced into clinical practice as a tool to assess the depth of anaesthesia objectively in the operating room. However, patients under general anaesthesia differ from those in an intensive care unit. Accordingly, most results from studies evaluating the performance of processed EEG parameters in critically ill patients have not been satisfactory. At present, monitoring sedation with processed EEG parameters cannot generally be recommended. However, in special situations such as deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade, in which clinical sedation scales are prone to failure, the bispectral index may help to assess the level of sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16634425/

Based on the Shannon entropy of the electroencephalogram, state entropy (SE) and response entropy (RE) are computed. We investigated the dose-response relationship of SE and RE during propofol anesthesia in comparison with the Bispectral Indextrade mark (BIS). Twenty patients were studied without surgical stimulus. Anesthesia was induced by a constant propofol infusion of 2000 mg/h (451 +/- 77 microg x min(-1) x kg(-1)) via a large forearm vein. Propofol was infused until substantial burst suppression occurred (more than 50%) or mean arterial blood pressure decreased to <60 mm Hg. Hereafter, infusions were stopped until recovery of BIS values up to 60 was reached. Subsequently, the constant propofol infusion of 2000 mg/h was restarted to increase depth of anesthesia and again decreased (infusion was stopped) within the BIS value range of 40-60. The coefficient of determination (R2) and the prediction probability (P(K)) were calculated to evaluate the performance of SE, RE, and BIS to predict changing propofol effect-site concentrations. R2 values for SE, RE, and BIS of 0.88 +/- 0.08, 0.89 +/- 0.07, and 0.92 +/- 0.06, respectively, were similar. The calculated P(K) values, however, revealed a significant difference between SE and RE compared with BIS, with P(K) = 0.77 +/- 0.09, 0.76 +/- 0.10, and 0.84 +/- 0.06, respectively. BIS seems to show slight advantages in predicting propofol effect-site concentrations compared with SE and RE, as measured by P(K) but not as measured by R2.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16632826/
16618305,Use of BIS monitor in a child with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis.,Paediatric anaesthesia,2006,"Brandes IF, Stuth EA","We describe a case of a 14-year-old boy with congenital insensitivity to pain and anhidrosis (CIPA) who underwent tarsal tunnel release for tarsal tunnel syndrome. Because of abnormal pain perception, the patient's response to normally painful surgical stimuli is severely impaired and not adequately reflected in a corresponding rise in blood pressure or heart rate. This lack of autonomic feedback to pain stimuli may make it more difficult to assess whether anesthetic depth is adequate to prevent intraoperative awareness and thus to safely conduct anesthesia, especially if muscle paralysis is required for surgical indications. We describe for the first time the use of processed EEG monitoring with a BIS A-2000 monitor to gauge anesthetic depth in a patient with CIPA. Initial forehead bispectral index (BIS) values prior to induction were normal (98) and then ranged between 23 and 79 during the whole surgical procedure. Propofol and lidocaine were used for induction and deep extubation; isoflurane was used as the sole anesthetic for maintenance with concentrations ranging from 0.21% to 0.92% to maintain a target BIS of 40-60. Volatile anesthetic requirements remained low throughout the procedure and no narcotics were necessary during surgery. The BIS monitor served as an adequate tool to help avoid excessive use of volatile anesthetic while assuring a processed EEG consistent with unconsciousness and amnesia. After the patient had recovered and was oriented to place and time in the recovery room, he was asked whether he remembered anything about the surgery and the presence of a breathing tube in his mouth. He denied any recall of such events.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16618305/
16602568,Quantifying cortical activity during general anesthesia using wavelet analysis.,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,2006,"Zikov T, Bibian S, Dumont GA, Huzmezan M, Ries CR","This paper reports on a novel method for quantifying the cortical activity of a patient during general anesthesia as a surrogate measure of the patient's level of consciousness. The proposed technique is based on the analysis of a single-channel (frontal) electroencephalogram (EEG) signal using stationary wavelet transform (SWT). The wavelet coefficients calculated from the EEG are pooled into a statistical representation, which is then compared to two well-defined states: the awake state with normal EEG activity, and the isoelectric state with maximal cortical depression. The resulting index, referred to as the wavelet-based anesthetic value for central nervous system monitoring (WAV(CNS)), quantifies the depth of consciousness between these two extremes. To validate the proposed technique, we present a clinical study which explores the advantages of the WAV(CNS) in comparison with the BIS monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, MA), currently a reference in consciousness monitoring. Results show that the WAV(CNS) and BIS are well correlated (r = 0.969) during periods of steady-state despite fundamental algorithmic differences. However, in terms of dynamic behavior, the WAV(CNS) offers faster tracking of transitory changes at induction and emergence, with an average lead of 15-30 s. Furthermore, and conversely to the BIS, the WAV(CNS) regains its preinduction baseline value when patients are responding to verbal command after emergence from anesthesia. We conclude that the proposed analysis technique is an attractive alternative to BIS monitoring. In addition, we show that the WAV(CNS) dynamics can be modeled as a linear time invariant transfer function. This index is, therefore, well suited for use as a feedback sensor in advisory systems, closed-loop control schemes, and for the identification of the pharmacodynamic models of anesthetic drugs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16602568/

The Entropy Module produces two values, State Entropy (SE) and Response Entropy (RE), and in adults, it has been shown to measure reliably the hypnotic effects of various drugs. In children, Spectral Entropy has been only preliminary studied. The authors' aim was to study Spectral Entropy as a marker of hypnotic state during general anesthesia in infants and children.
Twenty infants (aged 1 month-1 yr) and 40 children (aged 1-15 yr) were anesthetized for surgery using standardized sevoflurane-nitrous oxide-based anesthesia. The relationships between SE, RE, or Bispectral Index (BIS) and (1) a modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale, (2) non-steady state end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane, (3) steady state end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane, and (4) hemodynamic values were calculated using prediction probability, nonlinear regression, and correlation coefficients, as appropriate. The performances of SE, RE, and BIS were compared.
The prediction probability values (+/- SEM) of SE, RE, and BIS versus the modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale in the induction phase were 0.83 +/- 0.06, 0.88 +/- 0.06, and 0.87 +/- 0.08 for children and 0.76 +/- 0.08,0.79 +/- 0.08, and 0.73 +/- 0.10 for infants; values in the emergence phase were 0.68 +/- 0.05, 0.74 +/- 0.04, and 0.64 +/- 0.05 for children and 0.64 +/- 0.07, 0.69 +/- 0.06, and 0.72 +/- 0.06 for infants, respectively. SE, RE, and BIS values were inversely proportionally related to the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane for children, but for infants, the correlation was much less clear. No significant correlations were found between SE, RE, or BIS values and the hemodynamic values.
Spectral Entropy may be a useful tool for measuring the level of hypnosis in anesthetized children and seems to perform as well as BIS. In infants, the clinical usefulness of both these electroencephalogram-derived methods must be evaluated in further controlled studies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16571966/

We conducted an observational study comparing performance characteristics of bispectral index (BIS) and entropy monitoring systems in these patients.
Thirty-one patients of the World Federation of Neurosurgeons grades 1 and 2, undergoing embolization of cerebral artery aneurysms following acute subarachnoid haemorrhage, were recruited to have both BIS and entropy monitoring during general anaesthesia. BIS and entropy indices were matched to clinical indicators of anaesthetic depth. Anaesthetists were blinded to the anaesthetic depth monitoring indices. Analysis of data from monitoring devices allowed calculation of prediction probability (P(K)) constants, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to be performed.
BIS and entropy [response entropy (RE), state entropy (SE)] performed well in their ability to show concordance with clinically observed anaesthetic depth. P(K) values were generally high (BIS 0.966-0.784, RE 0.934-0.663, SE 0.857-0.701) for both forms of monitoring. ROC curve analysis shows a high sensitivity and specificity for all monitoring indices when used to detect the presence or absence of eyelash reflex. Area under curve for BIS, RE and SE to detect the absence or presence of eyelash reflex was 0.932, 0.888 and 0.887, respectively. RE provides earlier warning of return of eyelash reflex than BIS.

The Bispectral Index System (BIS) is an EEG monitor that measures the anesthesia level. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of monitoring the BIS to not monitoring the BIS on time from discontinuation of GA to extubation and to discharge.
Twenty-nine children were enrolled. BIS was monitored from admission until discharge. Each child received 0.7 mg/kg of oral Versed. In the operating room, GA with sevoflurane (IH), rocuronium 1 mg/kg (IV), fentanyl 1 microg/kg (IV), and ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg (IV) was administered. Randomly, in half the patients, the anesthesiologist maintained the level of anesthesia and BIS by adjusting sevoflurane. In the rest, the anesthesiologist did not know BIS. The time from turning off sevoflurane to discharge was compared.

However, there are no data available on the accuracy of the Entropy Module in estimating nociception during sevoflurane anaesthesia.
Forty female patients were enrolled in the present study. Each patient was allocated randomly to one of four end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (ET(sev)) groups (1.3, 1.7, 2.1 or 2.5%). A BIS Sensor (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) and an Entropy Sensor (Datex-Ohmeda) were applied side-by-side to the forehead. The bispectral index (A-2000 BIS Monitor, version 3.4, Aspect Medical Systems), response entropy, state entropy and patient movement were observed after electrical stimulation (20, 40, 60 and 80 mA, 100 Hz, 5 s) and after skin incision during sevoflurane anaesthesia (1.3, 1.7, 2.1 or 2.5%). Accuracy of the EEG variables in differentiating the intensity of electrical stimulation was estimated by the prediction probability (P(K)) values.
Response entropy and state entropy [median, (range)] before skin incision were significantly lower in patients who did not move [29 (15-41) and 24 (14-41)] than in those that did [38 (24-53) and 37 (24-52)], but there was no significant difference in BIS. All EEG variables increased significantly (P<0.0001 for all) with increases in the intensity of electrical stimulation. The difference between response entropy and state entropy increased with increases in the electrical stimulation (P<0.0001). However, no EEG variables could differentiate the intensity of the electrical stimulations accurately because of low P(K)-values (P(K)<0.8).
Noxious stimulation increased the difference between response entropy and state entropy. However, an increase in the difference does not always indicate inadequate analgesia and should be interpreted carefully during anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16531443/

The aim of this study was to quantify the BIS values at 1 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) for desflurane and halothane, and explore the relationship with age for these anaesthetic agents in children.
ECG, EEG and BIS were recorded continuously in 90 children aged 6-170 months requiring anaesthesia for elective surgery. Fifty children were anaesthetized with desflurane, and 40 children with halothane. Recordings were performed through to a steady state of 2 MAC, and thereafter at 1 and 0.5 MAC, respectively. The bispectrum of the EEG was estimated using MATLAB(c) software. A multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was used.
At a steady state of 1 MAC, BIS values were significantly higher with halothane 62 (43-80) than desflurane 34 (18-64). BIS values were significantly correlated with age in both groups: DES (r(2)=0.57; P<0.01) and HALO (r(2)=0.48; P<0.01). Changes in position in the structured model of the MCA (dependent on the pattern of the EEG bispectrum) were different for the two volatile anaesthetic agents.
In children, BIS values are linked to age irrespective of the volatile anaesthetic agent used. The difference in BIS values for different agents at the same MAC can be explained by the specific effect on the EEG bispectrum induced by each anaesthetic agent, bringing into question the ability of the EEG bispectrum to accurately determine the depth of anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16500950/

Baseline self-reported BAS sensitivity predicted depression diagnosis (MDD or dysthymia) at follow-up, number of MDD symptoms at follow-up, average weekly level of depression, and time to recovery. These effects persisted after controlling for baseline clinical variables associated with a worse course. Baseline resting EEG alpha asymmetry did not significantly predict the course of depression.

We analysed the effect of a remifentanil bolus on the bispectral index of the electroencephalogram (bispectral index) under total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil.
ASA I-III patients were included in this study. All patients received a 2 microg k g-1 remifentanil bolus in a period free from stimuli. Bispectral index and haemodynamic data were collected from an A-2000XP bispectral index monitor (every second) and an AS/3 Datex monitor (every 5 s). Bispectral index data were analysed using the area under the curve. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were averaged at each 30-s period and analysed using analysis of variance.
A total of 240 bispectral index values were obtained per patient. The area under the curve between 90 and 120 s after the bolus was significantly lower than the basal area under the curve (average of all areas before the bolus, P < 0.05). Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly reduced from 96.4 +/- 19.9 mmHg at the time of the bolus to 74.2 +/- 16.6 mmHg 120 s after, and from 70 +/- 16.4 bpm at the time of the bolus to 61 +/- 13.6 bpm after (P < 0.001), respectively.
There was a significant reduction in the areas under the curve between 90-120 s following the bolus. Heart rate and blood pressure also showed significant reductions.

Unconsciousness and amnesia are not reliably observable end-points, but correlate with parameters derived from the electroencephalogram. We investigated the association of subjective assessment and electroencephalographic measures of anaesthetic depth in a group of experienced (>4 yr of experience) and a group of inexperienced (<2 yr of experience) anaesthesiologists.
One hundred ASA I or II patients were assigned to either group. Anaesthesiologists assessed 'anaesthetic depth' using an 11-point numeric and a 5-point verbal scale. Bispectral index and spectral entropy were recorded as electroencephalogram parameters. The association between the subjective assessment and the electroencephalogram parameters was calculated using the prediction probability, PK.
Association between subjective assessment and electroencephalographic parameters showed a tendency to a better prediction probability in the experienced group. The difference was significant (P < 0.05) for the bispectral index (PK 0.76 +/- 0.01 for experienced and 0.71 +/- 0.01 for inexperienced anaesthesiologists). In both groups, a large percentage of the data points recorded during surgery showed bispectral index values above the recommended value of 60 (13.2% in the experienced and 34.3% in the inexperienced group) despite a subjective assessment of 'deep' or 'very deep' anaesthetic depth.
The study demonstrates that the association between subjectively assigned values of anaesthetic depth and electroencephalographic parameters of anaesthetic depth is better for anaesthesiologists with more clinical experience. However, in the 'inexperienced' as well as 'experienced' group a high percentage of bispectral index and entropy values above 60 occurred despite a subjective assessment of adequate anaesthetic depth.

Its widespread use makes it the most-studied and the best-known among same intended devices. Its algorithm processes low-frequency EEG oscillations in order to provide the Bispectral index. A BIS index ranging from 40 to 60 has been established as the proper for surgical performance. The BIS monitor permits a closer approach to the hypnotic component of anaesthesia beyond clinical signs and may reduce the probability of intraoperative awareness; therefore, it has become a recommended monitoring tool in routine practice. The SNAP monitor (Nicolet Biomedical, Madison WI, USA) is also intended for monitoring the hypnotic effect of anaesthetics, which is in turn displayed as an index ranging from 100 to 0, with 100 meaning a fully awake state and 0 meaning no brain activity. The algorithm of the SNAP monitor is featured by its additional processing of ultra-high EEG frequencies, which seem to be involved in the formation of consciousness. The use of these frequencies would theoretically improve responsiveness during increased brain activity. We studied its behaviour patterns and capability to monitor the hypnotic effect induced by sevoflurane-nitrous oxide by comparison with the BIS index. Seventy patients ASA I-III were induced with propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium, and maintained with sevoflurane-N(2)O. BIS and SNAP indices were simultaneously recorded before induction, after intubation, after incision, at the following 10, 30 and 50 minutes, awakening and extubation time points, together with heart rate and blood pressure. The Pearson correlation was R(2) = 0.68 (p < .05). The Bland and Altman test showed a bias of 14.3 for SNAP index values with respect to BIS index values. We concluded that the SNAP index correlates with variations in the hypnotic effect induced by sevoflurane-nitrous oxide anaesthesia when compared with the BIS index. In this context, a SNAP index ranging from 58 to 70 would be equivalent to the BIS index range 40 to 60 and, therefore, the accurate for surgical performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16437288/

Maintenance anaesthesia (sevoflurane (20/38), desflurane (10/38) or propofol (8/38)) titrated by BIS XP (Aspect Medical, Natwick, MA, USA) and BIS and CSI (cerebral State Monitor, Danmeter; Odense, Denmark) index values were recorded every minute. No patient received muscle relaxation. Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation rating scale was used to assess level of sedation.
Pair-wise recordings (914) of CSI and BIS were collected. The indices showed similar pattern and decreased with increasing level of sedation, however with large ranges for each level of sedation.

During anaesthesia with volatile anaesthetics, it has been shown that the suppression of the spinal H-reflex correlates with surgical immobility. To evaluate whether the H-reflex could also be a possible candidate for monitoring immobility during propofol anaesthesia, this study assessed the concentration-dependent suppression of the H-reflex by propofol. To discriminate different effect sites, the individual concentration response-curves and the t(1/2ke0) of the H-reflex have been compared with those of two EEG parameters.
In 18 patients, anaesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol infused using a target-controlled infusion pump at stepwise increasing and decreasing plasma concentrations between 0.5 and 4.5 mg/l. The H-reflex of the soleus muscle was recorded at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. Calculated propofol concentrations and H-reflex amplitude were analysed in terms of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model with a sigmoid concentration-response function.
For slowly increasing propofol concentrations, computer fits of the PKPD model for H-reflex suppression by propofol yielded the following median parameters: EC50 1.1 (0.8-1.7) mg/l, slope parameter 2.4 (2.0-3.7), and a t(1/2ke0) of 6.7 (2.8-7.5, 25-75% quantiles) min. For the bispectral index, the t(1/2ke0) was 2.2 (1.8-3.1) min and for the spectral edge frequency at the 95th percentile of the power spectrum 2.8 (1.9-3.2) min.
Propofol, unlike sevoflurane, suppresses the spinal H-reflex at concentrations far lower than the C50 skin incision. The differences in t(1/2ke0)-values indicate the presence of different effect compartments for effects on the H-reflex and the EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16430541/

Plasma triazolam concentrations (mean +/- SD, 5.1 +/- 1.1 ng/mL) and drug effects (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score, 2 +/- 1; and the bispectral index score, 62 +/- 16) were greatest in all subjects at the end of the 3-hour evaluation period. Eight of the subjects had Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scores consistent with the definition of deep sedation or general anesthesia (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score, <3) at some of the later time points in the 180 minutes of data collection. In comparison, 4 of the subjects had bispectral index scores less than 60 during these later time points of data collection. Given the considerable intersubject variability in triazolam concentrations and effects, additional research is needed to assess this multidosing strategy before it can be endorsed as a useful and safe sedation technique for managing fearful and anxious patients in dental practice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16415697/

We evaluated the variation of pulse plethysmography amplitude induced by an electrical tetanic stimulus (PPG variation) as a potential measure for analgesia and predictor of haemodynamic responsiveness during general anaesthesia.
Ninety-five patients, ASA I or II, were randomly assigned to five groups [Group 1: bispectral index (BIS) (range) 40-50, effect site remifentanil concentration 1 ng ml(-1);Group 2: BIS 40-50, remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1); Group 3: BIS 40-50, remifentanil 4 ng ml(-1); Group 4: BIS 25-35, remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1); Group 5: BIS 55-65, remifentanil 2 ng ml(-1)]. A 60 mA tetanic stimulus was applied for 5 s on the ulnar nerve. From the digitized pulse oximeter wave recorded on a laptop computer, linear and non-linear parameters of PPG variation during the 60 s period after stimulation were computed. The haemodynamic response to subsequent orotracheal intubation was recorded. The PPG variation was compared between groups and between responders and non-responders to intubation (anova). Variables independently predicting the response were determined by logistic regression.
The probability of a response to tracheal intubation was 0.77, 0.47, 0.05, 0.18 and 0.52 in Groups 1-5, respectively (P<0.03). The PPG variability was significantly higher in responders than in non-responders but it did not improve the prediction of the response to tracheal intubation based on BIS level and effect site remifentanil concentration.
Tetanic stimulation induced PPG variation does not reflect the analgesic state in a wide clinical range of surgical anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16415316/

We performed an observational prospective study in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital of 19 patients hospitalized nonconsecutively in the ICU with serious neurologic pathology and evolution toward BD. A BIS monitor, XP model, and the sensor ""BIS Quatro"" were used to continuously record values: suppression ratio (SR), quality of the signal index, and electromyographic (EMG) activity.
The BD diagnosis was made through neurological clinical exploration and electroencephalogram (EEG) in all the cases. Additionally, transcranial Doppler was used in 13 patients. Coincident with clinical worsening, it was observed that there was a gradual decrease of the BIS value, together with a rise in the SR. In all the patients in which the BD diagnosis was confirmed, the BIS showed values of 0 and suppression rates of 100. Only one patient showed interferences, due to EMG activity, the same problem was detected when a conventional EEG was performing. After using a neuromuscular blocker, the values of BIS and SR were 0 and 100, respectively.
The BIS is a noninvasive, simple, and easy to interpret method. All the patients with BD diagnosis except for one had a BIS value of 0 and TS of 100, showing a perfect correlation with the other diagnostic methods. The BIS cannot be used on its own for the confirmation of the BD, but it is a useful tool to detect the beginning of brain herniation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16386497/

The aim of the present study was an empirical investigation on the relation between cortical trait activity, BIS and BAS. Data of 59 subjects on four occasions were analyzed. On each occasion, cortical activity was evaluated with resting EEG, and the BIS and BAS strength was assessed with questionnaires.

However, whether changes in binding lead to clinically significant changes in the drug effect remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in the drug effect of propofol in response to altered plasma binding using quantitative EEG measurements.
Thirty patients undergoing cardiac surgery were assigned randomly to receive propofol infusions at 4 (Group P-4) or 6 (Group P-6) mg kg(-1) h(-1) during surgery. The concentration of propofol in blood samples, collected from the radial artery at predetermined intervals, was determined by HPLC. The unbound fraction of drug in plasma was estimated using equilibrium dialysis. Bispectral index (BIS) and burst suppression ratio (BSR) were measured at the time blood samples were collected.
The total concentration of propofol in blood was unchanged during CPB relative to the pre-CPB value in both groups. However, the fraction of unbound propofol in blood increased by 2-fold during CPB. While BIS values were unchanged during CPB in Group P-4, there was a slight, but significant, decrease in Group P-6. In both groups, BSR significantly increased during CPB. BIS values showed a weak correlation with the concentration of unbound propofol (r(2)=0.19, P<0.001). BSR showed a moderate correlation with the concentration of unbound propofol (r(2)=0.56, P<0.001).
The anaesthetic effect of propofol significantly increased during CPB without any alteration in the total drug concentration. The enhanced efficacy may be caused by a reduction in plasma binding of the drug.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16339790/

Twelve patients with BPD and 12 healthy controls were additionally rated with the Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS-10). Participants performed a Go/Nogo task while a 64 channel EEG was recorded. Three ERP components were of special interest: error-related negativity (ERN)/error negativity (Ne), early error positivity (early Pe) reflecting automatic error processing, and the late Pe component which is thought to mirror the awareness of erroneous responses. We found smaller amplitudes of the ERN/Ne in patients with BPD compared to controls. Moreover, significant correlations with the BIS-10 non-planning sub-score could be demonstrated for both the entire group and the patient group. No between-group differences were observed for the early and late Pe components.

Underdosing the drug may fail to control the intracranial pressure, whereas overdosing may lead to untoward effects such as hypotension and cardiac compromise.

Starting 2 min after the beginning of propofol administration (1.26 mg kg(-1)), the EEG recordings showed burst and suppression pattern for the next 12 min. The EEG during this period was characterized by gradual prolongation of suppression periods until the appearance of the isoelectric line. After that, burst activity returned and eventually the burst suppression pattern disappeared. We excluded the possibility of ischemic brain damage, and the evidence increasingly points toward a greater sensitivity to propofol.

Forty unpremedicated patients received anesthesia with remifentanil and either sevoflurane or propofol. With remifentanil infusion (0.2 microg . kg . min), patients were asked every 30 s to squeeze the investigator's hand. Sevoflurane or propofol was given until loss of consciousness. After intubation, propofol or sevoflurane was stopped until patients followed the command (return of consciousness). Thereafter, propofol or sevoflurane was started again (loss of consciousness), and surgery was performed. Return of consciousness was observed after surgery. The electroencephalogram and AEP from immediately before and after the transitions were selected. Logistic regression was calculated to identify models for the separation between consciousness and unconsciousness. For the top 10 models, 1,000-fold cross-validation was performed. Backward variable selection was applied to identify a minimal model. Prediction probability was calculated. The digitized electroencephalogram was replayed, and the Bispectral Index was measured and accordingly analyzed.
The best full model (prediction probability 0.89) contained 15 AEP and 4 electroencephalographic parameters. The best minimal model (prediction probability 0.87) contained 2 AEP and 2 electroencephalographic parameters (median frequency of the amplitude spectrum from 8-30 Hz and approximate entropy). The prediction probability of the Bispectral Index was 0.737.
A combination of electroencephalographic and AEP parameters can be used to differentiate between consciousness and unconsciousness even in a very challenging data set. The minimal model contains a combination of AEP and electroencephalographic parameters and has a higher prediction probability than Bispectral Index for the separation between consciousness and unconsciousness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16249666/

In all three cases there was severe neurological injury incompatible with survival and end of life decisions were made. Although the utility of quantitative EEG technology, like the Bispectral index (BIS) or Patient State Analyzer (PSA), is becoming better defined in the operating room, the role in the ICU is less clear.

16199415,Concentration-dependent suppression of F-waves by sevoflurane does not predict immobility to painful stimuli in humans.,British journal of anaesthesia,2005,"Baars JH, Kalisch D, Herold KF, Hadzidiakos DA, Rehberg B","Decreased spinal excitability contributes to the immobilizing effects of halogenated ethers during general anaesthesia. Recurrent spinal responses such as F-waves reflect spinal excitability and are suppressed by volatile anaesthetics. To evaluate whether F-waves are suitable for monitoring immobility, the concentration-dependent effects of sevoflurane on F-waves were compared with effects on the Bispectral Index (BIS). The predictive power of all parameters for movement responses to noxious stimuli was tested. In addition, the effect of the noxious stimulus itself on F-waves was investigated.
In 28 patients, F-waves were recorded during sevoflurane anaesthesia at a frequency of 0.2 Hz at the lower limb. To insert a laryngeal mask, the sevoflurane concentration was initially increased to approximately 4%, which caused a complete extinction of F-waves. The sevoflurane concentration was then reduced until the F-waves recovered. BIS and spectral edge frequency (SEF(95)) were recorded continuously. The t(1/2ke0) and EC(50) values of the F-wave persistence and amplitude were calculated using a standard pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. During decreasing sevoflurane concentration motor responses to tetanic electrical stimulation (50 Hz, 60 mA, 5 s, volar forearm) were tested in seven patients and MAC(tetanus) was calculated using logistic regression.
Sevoflurane reduces the F-wave amplitude with an EC(50) of 0.79 vol% at a far lower concentration than the calculated MAC(tetanus) (1.5 vol%), whereas the F-wave persistence yields an EC(50) of 1.4 vol%. Spinal and EEG parameters predicted the motor responses to movement better than chance alone, but did not differ significantly from each other.
F-waves, especially the F-wave amplitude, cannot be used to predict movement to noxious stimuli during sevoflurane anaesthesia because they are almost completely suppressed at subclinical sevoflurane concentrations. Either the particular motoneurone pool (the largest motoneurones) assessed by F-waves is not involved in generating movement to painful stimuli or direct effects on motoneurone excitability are not involved in the suppression of movement to painful stimuli by sevoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16199415/
16192535,Can electroencephalographic analysis be used to determine sedation levels in critically ill patients?,Anesthesia and analgesia,2005,"Roustan JP, Valette S, Aubas P, Rondouin G, Capdevila X","Prolonged use of sedative drugs frequently leads to oversedation of intensive care patients. Clinical assessment scales are not reliable in deeply sedated patients. Parameters obtained from spectral and bispectral analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) records have been combined to create an index (BIS) to monitor anesthesia depth. The role of such parameters in monitoring the depth of the sedation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients has yet to be determined. We designed the present prospective study to redefine and calculate available spectral and bispectral parameters from raw EEG records and estimate their clinical relevance for the diagnosis of under- or oversedation levels in ICU patients. Forty adult patients receiving continuous midazolam and morphine sedation were included. We obtained 167 clinical evaluations of sedation level using Ramsay and COMFORT scales along with an EEG record of 300 s. Six spectral parameters-relative power of 4 frequency bands (beta, alpha, Theta, and delta), 95th percentile of the power spectrum (SEF95), and 50th percentile of the power spectrum (SEF50) and four bispectral parameters, real triple product, bispectrum (Bispectrum), bicoherence, and ratio 10-were calculated. The relevance of each of these parameters and combinations in predicting too light (Ramsay 1 and 2) or deep (Ramsay 5 and 6) sedation levels was assessed. These calculations were performed before and after exclusion of the agitated patients, whose COMFORT 4 score was above 2. The most relevant parameters for predicting levels of deep sedation (Ramsay 5 and 6) were ratio 10 (area under the curve = 0.763; 95% confidence interval, 0.679-0.833) and SEF95 (area under the curve = 0.687; 95% confidence interval, 0.597-0.767). The most relevant parameters for predicting light levels of sedation (Ramsay 1 and 2) were also ratio 10 (area under the curve = 0.829; 95% confidence interval, 0.695-0.917) and SEF95 (area under the curve = 0.798; 95% confidence interval, 0.650-0.898). There is a modest improvement in relevance of their linear combination in predicting sedation level. Results were similar after exclusion of agitated patients. We conclude that various calculated EEG descriptive parameters exhibited large interindividual variability. There was a strong correlation between EEG spectral and bispectral parameters. Bispectral analysis slightly improves the predictive power of simple spectral analysis in distinguishing too light or deep sedation levels in ICU patients.
Spectral edge frequency 95 and Ratio 10 are the most relevant electroencephalogram (EEG) indexes for monitoring the level of sedation in intensive care unit patients but calculated EEG values exhibited large interindividual variability.

The EEG changes with brain maturation, but there are limited published data describing the characteristics of entropy in children, and some data suggest that BIS is less reliable in young children. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of entropy as a measure of anaesthetic effect in different age groups. The performance of entropy was compared with BIS.
Fifty-four children receiving a standard sevoflurane anaesthetic for cardiac catheter studies were enrolled. The entropy and BIS were recorded pre-awakening and at 1.5%, 2% and 2.5% steady-state end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations. For analysis children were divided into four age groups: 0-1 yr, 1-2 yr, 2-4 yr and 4-12 yr.
The pre-awakening values were obtained in 46 children. The median pre-awakening values for entropy and BIS varied significantly across ages with the values being lowest in the 0-1 yr age group (response entropy: 45 vs 84, 87 and 89, P=0.003; state entropy: 36 vs 78, 74 and 77, P=0.009; BIS: 56 vs 78, 76.5 and 72, P=0.02). Values were recorded at all three sevoflurane concentrations in 48 children. Compared with older groups, the 0-1 yr age group had the least significant difference in BIS and entropy when compared among different sevoflurane concentrations. The calculated sevoflurane concentrations to achieve mid-scale values of entropy and BIS were highest in the 1-2 yr age group, lower in the 0-1 yr age group and progressively lower in the 2-4 and 4-12 yr age groups.
For both entropy and BIS the measure of anaesthetic effect was significantly different for children aged <1 yr compared with older children. There was no difference in performance of entropy and BIS. Both should be used cautiously in small children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16183678/

Meanwhile, a number of studies indicate that with total IV anesthesia, BIS and Narcotrend have comparable effects on drug consumption and recovery times whereas comparative clinical data for volatile anesthetics are still missing. Therefore, we designed the present prospective, randomized, and double-blinded study to compare the effects of BIS and Narcotrend monitoring during desflurane-remifentanil anesthesia and versus a standard anesthetic practice protocol. One-hundred-twenty adult patients scheduled for minor orthopedic surgery were randomized to receive a desflurane-remifentanil anesthetic controlled either by Narcotrend or by BIS or solely by clinical variables. Anesthesia was induced with 0.4 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) remifentanil and 2 mg/kg propofol. After tracheal intubation, remifentanil was infused at a constant rate of 0.2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) whereas desflurane in 1.5 L/min O(2)/air was adjusted according to clinical variables or the following target values: during maintenance of anesthesia to a value of ""D(0)"" (Narcotrend) or ""50"" (BIS), 15 min before the end of surgery to ""C(1)"" (Narcotrend) or ""60"" (BIS), whereas in the standard protocol group, desflurane was controlled according to clinical variables, e.g., heart rate, arterial blood pressure, movements. Recovery times and desflurane consumption were recorded by a blinded investigator. The desflurane vaporizer was weighed before and after anesthesia and consumption per minute was calculated. Data are mean +/- sd. The groups were comparable for demographic data, duration of anesthesia, and mean remifentanil dosages. Compared with standard practice, patients with Narcotrend or BIS monitoring needed significantly less desflurane (standard practice 443 +/- 71 mg/min, Narcotrend 374 +/- 124 mg/min, BIS monitoring 416 +/- 99 mg/min desflurane [both P < 0.05]). However, recovery times were not significantly different between the groups, e.g., opening of eyes 4.7 +/- 2.2 versus 3.7 +/- 2.0 versus 4.2 +/- 2.1 min. During desflurane-remifentanil anesthesia, Narcotrend and BIS monitoring seem to be equally effective compared with standard anesthetic practice: BIS and Narcotrend allow for a small reduction of desflurane consumption whereas recovery times are only slightly reduced.
Monitoring the electroencephalogram with Narcotrend or Bispectral Index during desflurane-remifentanil anesthesia only slightly reduces recovery times when compared with a standard practice protocol.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16037157/

Ten healthy volunteers (aged 21-37 yr) participated on two occasions and in random order received placebo or propofol infusions. Standard monitoring and radial artery blood pressure were combined with measurement of forearm blood flow (plethysmography) and derivation of forearm vascular resistance, recording of peroneal nerve sympathetic activity, and blood sampling for norepinephrine concentrations. A computer-controlled infusion pump delivered placebo or two concentrations of propofol, adjusted to achieve moderate and deep sedation based on the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score (responsiveness component) of 4 and 3. Level of sedation was quantitated using bispectral analysis of the electroencephalogram. Baroreflexes were assessed with a hypotensive challenge via administration of sodium nitroprusside.
Baseline neurocirculatory and respiratory parameters did not differ between sessions. Progressive infusions to achieve moderate and deep sedation resulted in average Bispectral Index values of 70 and 54, respectively. Propofol significantly reduced sympathetic nerve activity at both levels of sedation and decreased norepinephrine and forearm vascular resistance at deep sedation. These effects resulted in significant decreases in mean blood pressure of 9% and 18% at moderate and deep sedation, respectively. Propofol also reduced reflex increases in sympathetic nerve activity.
These data from healthy subjects indicate that sedation doses of propofol, which did not compromise respiratory function, had substantial inhibitory effects on sympathetic nerve activity and reflex responses to hypotension resulting in vasodilation and significant decreases in mean blood pressure.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15983452/

We surmised that the BIS values would reflect these functional changes. Eight epileptic patients were enrolled. A full array of 21 EEG electrodes and 2 BIS XP (Quatro) strips over each frontal region of the scalp were applied. The EEG was continuously recorded. BIS values from each hemisphere were recorded every minute. Angiography was performed by advancing a catheter into each internal carotid artery. Amobarbital or methohexital was injected until the patient developed a hemiparesis. The EEG confirmed a significant lateralized cortical effect of the barbiturate. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyze the differences between the BIS values from monitor electrode strips placed on the left (left BIS) and the right (right BIS) sides of the head as well as the differences in the left and right BIS values before and after each injection of the barbiturate. Injection of barbiturate into either the left or right internal carotid artery produced a significant change on the 21-electrode EEG. However, there was no difference between left BIS to right BIS values (P = 0.84). With repeated injections of barbiturates, some patients became sedated.

15891425,Novel monitoring techniques for use with procedural sedation.,Current opinion in pediatrics,2005,"Levine DA, Platt SL","A variety of pharmacologic agents used for procedural sedation in children to reduce pain and anxiety may produce respiratory depression and hypotension. Although standard monitoring guidelines include oxygen saturation, this measurement is limited as a guide to respiratory function. This review discusses two new monitoring techniques recently introduced to the pediatric emergency department that facilitate procedural sedation and reduce potential adverse effects of the medications administered.
Capnography via an end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor measures carbon dioxide concentrations during ventilation. This measurement is independent of oxygen saturation and thereby aids the clinician in identifying hypoventilation and apnea in the sedated patient at an earlier stage than conventional monitoring. The bispectral index monitor objectively measures the depth of sedation by analyzing electroencephalogram signals from a cutaneous probe. This tool enables the physician to titrate sedative medications to a desired effect and thereby reduce the risks associated with oversedation.
Studies have illustrated the use of both devices as adjuncts to current standard monitoring of children in the outpatient setting. These modalities will facilitate the efficacy of procedural sedation in children and improve safety by enabling early recognition of hypoventilation and by reducing the risk of oversedation in children undergoing procedural sedation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15891425/
15875125,The bispectral index predicts responsiveness to verbal commands in patients emerging from nitrous oxide anesthesia supplemented with a subhypnotic concentration of isoflurane.,Journal of anesthesia,2005,"Goto T, Ishiguro Y, Nakata Y, Morita S","Nitrous oxide (N2O) administered alone has minimal effects on the bispectral index (BIS), an electroencephalogram-derived parameter of hypnosis. However, because this gas is commonly supplemented with a volatile anesthetic, we sought to determine how it would affect the BIS when coadministered with a low concentration of isoflurane.
Twelve patients were anesthetized with 70% N2O + 0.2% isoflurane (all concentrations are end-tidal). Following the end of surgery, the concentration of N2O was decreased in decrements of 10% while isoflurane was continued at 0.2%, and each new concentration of N2O was maintained for 15 min. This procedure was repeated until the patients first opened their eyes or squeezed the investigator's hand on command.
N2O 70% + isoflurane 0.2% reduced the BIS to 68 +/- 9 (mean +/- SD). When the concentration of N2O was decreased toward awakening (which occurred at the N2O concentration of 36% +/- 8%), the BIS progressively increased until it reached 93 +/- 5 on awakening.
The BIS reflects the level of hypnosis during N2O anesthesia supplemented with a low concentration of isoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15875125/

In some instances, painful stimulation in the presence of inadequate anesthesia results in a suppression of the electroencephalogram. This phenomenon has been referred to as a ""paradoxical arousal."" In our daily practice, we have noted a marked decrease in the bispectral index (BIS) with large delta waves during abdominal surgery when the abdominal cavity was irrigated with normal saline. In the present study, we sought to evaluate changes in BIS during intraabdominal irrigation. Eighteen ASA physical status I-II patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were enrolled in the study and allocated randomly to the control group (group C) or the fentanyl group (group F). Anesthesia was induced with 3 mg/kg of thiopental and was maintained with sevoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide. BIS, 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95), and burst-suppression ratio were recorded using a BIS monitor. Near the end of the procedure, but before irrigation of the abdominal cavity, 1.5 microg/kg fentanyl was given IV to group F. There was no significant change in BIS or SEF95 in group F patients during subsequent irrigation of the abdominal cavity. In contrast, BIS and SEF95 decreased significantly after start of irrigation in group C patients. These data show that the stimulation occurring during intraabdominal irrigation might cause a paradoxical arousal response, as evidenced by a decrease in processed electroencephalographic parameters. Pretreatment with fentanyl suppressed these changes. Anesthesiologists should be aware of this paradoxical arousal response to avoid an inappropriate decrease in the anesthetic concentration in such situations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15845688/

BIS and raw EEG were recorded at a steady state of 1 MAC in 100 children, and during a decrease from 2 to 0.5 MAC in a sub-group of 29 children. The bispectrum of the EEG was estimated using MATLAB software. For analysis, the bispectrum was divided into 36 frequencies of coupling (P(i))--the MatBis. A multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was used to establish an underlying structure of the pattern of each individual's MatBis at 1 MAC. Clustering of children into homogeneous groups was conducted by a hierarchical ascending classification (HAC). The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05.
At 1 MAC, the BIS values for all children ranged from 20 to 74 (median 40). Projection of both age and BIS value recorded at 1 MAC onto the structured model of the MCA showed them to be distributed along the same axis, demonstrating that the different values of BIS obtained in younger or older children are mainly dependent on their MatBis. At 1 MAC, six homogeneous groups of children were obtained through the HAC. Groups 5 (30 months; range 23-49) and 6 (18 months; range 6-180) were the younger children and Group 1 (97 months; range 46-162) the older. Groups 5 and 6 had the highest median values of BIS (54; range 50-59) (55; range 26-74) and Group 1 the lowest values (29; range 22-37).
The EEG bispectrum, as well as the BIS appeared to be strongly related to the age of children at 1 MAC sevoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15833781/

Clinical experience indicates that Narcotrend monitoring (MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany, version 4.0) excludes more EEG epochs because of artefacts than bispectral index monitoring (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA, version XP). Whether this increased exclusion of epochs is justified has not been investigated yet.
Eighteen adult patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were investigated. Induction of anaesthesia was performed with a fentanyl bolus and a propofol infusion. Additionally, following intubation patients received 15 ml bupivacaine 0.5% epidurally. After a waiting period of 45 min depth of anaesthesia was varied two times by increasing and decreasing propofol concentrations. Narcotrend index, BIS values and calculated propofol effect site concentrations were automatically recorded at intervals of 5 s. We tested the hypothesis whether exclusion of artefacts detected by the Narcotrend monitor would possibly improve the prediction probability of the BIS monitor, justifying the necessity of artefact suppression.
Simulated propofol effect site concentrations ranged from 2 microg/ml to 6 microg/ml. The Narcotrend monitor excluded a significantly higher percentage of epochs because of artefact detection (12.6 + 1.0%) than the BIS monitor (0.4 +/- 0.1%). The performance of BIS as an indicator of predicted propofol effect site concentrations did not differ when including (P(K) = 0.86 +/- 0.05) or excluding (P(K) = 0.85 +/- 0.04) the data pairs where Narcotrend monitor but not BIS monitor indicated an artefact. Artefacts were evenly distributed over the investigated range ofpropofol effect site concentrations.
Exclusion of data pairs that were detected as artefacts by Narcotrend but not by BIS did not change the performance of bispectral index as an indicator of propofol effect site concentration.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15779840/

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is believed to be one of the useful forms of monitoring cerebrovascular insufficiency during CEA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring, a processed EEG parameter, for the reliable detection of intraoperative cerebral ischaemia during awake CEA.
We monitored 52 patients continuously with the BIS monitor together with assessment of neurological function (contralateral upper and lower limb strength and the verbal component of the Glasgow Coma Scale for speech) in patients undergoing awake CEA.
Overall mean BIS value in all patients was 96 (SD 2.9). In five patients who showed clinical evidence of cortical ischaemia during carotid cross-clamping, there was no change in the original range of BIS values throughout the procedure (96.7 [3.2]). In one patient BIS values decreased to 38 about 5 min after the incision and recovered within the next 10 min. The mean BIS value in the remaining 46 patients who did not develop clinical signs of ischaemia was 95.4 (2.6). Three cases are presented which demonstrate the inability of the BIS monitor to detect cerebral ischaemia.
Lack of correlation of BIS with the signs of cerebral ischaemia during CEA makes it unreliable for detection of cerebrovascular insufficiency. We conclude that awake neurological testing is the preferred method of monitoring in these patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15778269/

Prospective, cohort, observational, unblinded study.
Surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital.
Forty-six patients undergoing major abdominal surgery scheduled for postoperative mechanical ventilation and continuous sedation.
Patients were continuously sedated using propofol and sufentanil.
Electrodes for determination of BIS were placed at the forehead of the patients according to the manufacturer's specifications immediately after arrival to the intensive care unit. The level of consciousness was assessed every 2 hrs by a clinical sedation scale (Ramsay sedation scale, levels 1-6). BIS, electromyographic activity, and signal quality index were recorded simultaneously at the same time as the Ramsay scale for 24 hrs or until patients were ready for extubation. BIS (version 2.10) and BIS XP (version 3.12) were determined at 2-hr intervals. BIS and BIS XP showed a high correlation of readings (rs = .79, p < .01). However, the methods did not yield identical results. Both variables were significantly influenced by electromyographic activity, especially at high values, whereas there was only a weak correlation with body temperature. Some of the deeply sedated patients (Ramsay 5 or 6) had BIS readings >80 (BIS, 16%; BIS XP, 13%; p = not significant).
The newer algorithm BIS XP did not perform better than the previous version BIS in patients after major surgery who were mechanically ventilated and sedated on an intensive care unit.

Magnesium is an attractive anti-shivering agent because it is used for treatment of postoperative shivering and provides protection against ischaemic injury in animal models. We tested the hypothesis that magnesium reduces the threshold (triggering core temperature) and gain of shivering without substantial sedation or muscle weakness.
We studied nine healthy male volunteers (18-40 yr) on two randomly assigned treatment days: (1) control and (2) magnesium (80 mg kg(-1) followed by infusion at 2 g h(-1)). Lactated Ringer's solution (4 degrees C) was infused via a central venous catheter over a period of approximately 2 h to decrease tympanic membrane temperature by approximately 1.5 degrees C h(-1). A significant and persistent increase in oxygen consumption identified the threshold. The gain of shivering was determined by the slope of oxygen consumption vs core temperature regression. Sedation was evaluated using a verbal rating score (VRS) from 0 to 10 and bispectral index (BIS) of the EEG. Peripheral muscle strength was evaluated using dynamometry and spirometry. Data were analysed using repeated measures anova; P<0.05 was statistically significant.
Magnesium reduced the shivering threshold (36.3 [SD 0.4] degrees C vs 36.6 [0.3] degrees C, P = 0.040). It did not affect the gain of shivering (control, 437 [289] ml min(-1) degrees C(-1); magnesium, 573 [370] ml min(-1) degrees C(-1); P=0.344). The magnesium bolus did not produce significant sedation or appreciably reduce muscle strength.
Magnesium significantly reduced the shivering threshold. However, in view of the modest absolute reduction, this finding is considered to be clinically unimportant for induction of therapeutic hypothermia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15749735/

The present study assessed electroencephalographic activity at rest and during photic stimulation in two groups: (1) an impulsive group (n=10) scoring high on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and reporting no indication of impulsive aggressive behavior; and (2) a non-aggressive control group (n=14) scoring within the normal range on the BIS-11. All subjects completed a brief battery of personality measures related to impulsivity and aggression. Resting EEG was recorded at 9 electrode sites. Photic stimulation was administered at three frequency levels. The primary findings were consistently lower frontal delta and theta activity in the impulsive group as well as a different topographical pattern of beta activity between the groups. These differences appeared to be independent of photic stimulation. Personality analyses indicated significantly greater hostility and lifetime history of aggression in the impulsive group. Taken together, the personality and EEG results suggest some similarity between the present impulsive group and research on groups regularly exhibiting premeditated aggression. These results provide unique insight into the construct of impulsivity and its role in the expression of specific subtypes of aggressive behavior.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15694239/

However, this approach is prone to error. Inadequate monitoring of sedation and analgesia may contribute to adverse outcomes and complications. With this in mind, data obtained continuously using nonstimulating methods such as bispectral index (BIS) may have benefits in comparison with clinical monitoring of sedation. The aim of this prospective observational trial was to evaluate the use of electroencephalographic (EEG) BIS for monitoring sedation in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients.
Forty paediatric patients (<18 years) were sedated for mechanical ventilation in a cardiac surgical and general PICU. In each paediatric patient BIS and COMFORT score were obtained. The study protocol did not influence ongoing PICU therapy. BIS and corresponding COMFORT score were collected three times for each patient. Measurements with the best starting EEG impedances were analyzed further. Deep sedation was defined as a COMFORT score between 8 and 16, and light sedation as a score between 17 and 26. Biometric and physiological data, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality III scores were also recorded.
There was a good correlation (Spearman's rho 0.651; P = 0.001) between BIS and COMFORT score in the presence of deep sedation and low starting impedance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed best discrimination between deep and light sedation at a BIS level of 83.

The Entropy algorithm quantifies the degree of disorder in the EEG. During anaesthesia the disorder of the EEG, or entropy, falls. Entropy is independent of absolute frequency or amplitude of the EEG. This may make it suitable for paediatric anaesthesia. In this prospective observational blinded study we recorded the Entropy and Bispectral Index in 23 children undergoing general anaesthesia with isoflurane and nitrous oxide, supplemented with peripheral nerve blockade. We recorded Entropy at several times during anaesthesia, pre-awakening and 1-minute post-awakening. Entropy pre-awakening and 1 minute after awakening was compared to a value during anaesthesia in three age groups; less than one-year-old (infants), one to five years (toddlers) and five to twelve years (children). The correlation between BIS and Entropy was also calculated. Entropy post-awakening was higher than during anaesthesia for all age groups. Entropy pre-awakening was higher than during anaesthesia for the children and toddlers. This was not as apparent in infants. There was a strong correlation between BIS and Entropy for children and toddlers. The correlation was less for infants. This study demonstrates that, in children, Entropy is lower during anaesthesia when compared to awake values.

Depth of sedation was subjectively assessed with the Ramsay Sedation Score. The aepEX was recorded using an auditory evoked potentials system. The bispectral index and SEF95% were measured using an Aspect A-1000 monitor.
The aepEX, bispectral index, and SEF95% correlated with the Ramsay Sedation Score, the Pk value being greatest for the aepEX, followed by the bispectral index. All three variables could predict opening of the eyes in response to verbal commands or a glabellar tap, the aepEX being a better predictor than the bispectral index or SEF95%. All three EEG variables had Pk values >0.5 in predicting coughing or movement in response to tracheal suction, but they were unable to predict increases in heart rate or systolic blood pressure.
The aepEX was the best predictor, followed by bispectral index.

Results showed that in HA subjects, the lowest level of arousal (eyes closed) was associated with stronger right-sided parieto-temporal theta-1 (4-6 Hz) and beta-1 (12-18 Hz) activity, whereas increased non-emotional arousal (eyes open, viewing neutral movie clip) was marked by persisting favored right hemisphere beta-1 activity. In turn, viewing aversive movie clip by the HA group led to significant lateralized decrease of the right parieto-temporal beta-1 power, which was initially higher in the emotionally neutral conditions.

Ketamine is known to increase BIS in anaesthetized patients and may confound that index as a guide to steer administration of hypnotics. We compared the effects of ketamine on BIS, response entropy (RE) and state entropy (SE) during surgery under sevoflurane anaesthesia.
Twenty-two women undergoing gynaecological surgery were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized study. Anaesthesia was induced i.v. and maintained with sevoflurane. Under stable surgical and anaesthetic conditions, patients were assigned to receive either a bolus of ketamine 0.5 mg kg(-1) or the same volume of saline. Blood pressure, heart rate, BIS, RE and SE were measured every 2.5 min from 10 min before (baseline) until 15 min after ketamine or saline administration. The maximum relative increase in BIS, RE and SE compared with baseline was calculated for each patient. Values are mean (sd).
Baseline values were BIS 33 (4), RE 31 (5), SE 30 (5) for the ketamine patients and BIS 35 (3), RE 33 (5) and SE 32 (6) for the patients receiving saline. BIS, RE and SE increased significantly from 5 min (BIS) and 2.5 min (RE and SE) after ketamine administration, peaking at 46 (8) (BIS), 52 (12) (RE) and 50 (12) (SE) respectively. The maximum relative increase in RE [42.2 (10.4%)] and SE [41.6 (10.9)%] was higher than that of BIS [29.4 (10.4%)]. Blood pressure, heart rate and RE-SE gradient did not change in either group.

Arousal (due to audiovisual stimulation) may prevent isoflurane-induced blunting of AHVR. The purpose of this study was to assess whether this was also the case for halothane. The authors also assessed the effects of pain on the interaction of halothane and AHVR.
Step decreases in end-tidal partial pressure of oxygen using dynamic end-tidal forcing were performed from normoxia to hypoxia (50 mmHg) in 10 healthy volunteers, with end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide held 1-2 mmHg above normal, in six protocols: (1) control conditions (darkened, quiet room, eyes closed) without halothane and (2) with 0.1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) halothane; (3) audiovisual stimulation (bright room, loud television) without halothane and (4) with 0.1 MAC halothane; (5) pain (electrical stimulation of skin over the tibia to produce a visual analog pain score of 5-6 out of 10) without halothane and (6) with 0.1 MAC halothane. The Bispectral Index of the electroencephalogram was also monitored.
Halothane did not affect normoxic minute ventilation in any arousal state but significantly reduced the magnitude of AHVR by 50% regardless of the background arousal state (P < 0.001). Bispectral Index values were reduced by halothane only in the absence of arousal (P < 0.003). Both pain and audiovisual stimulation modestly increased normoxic minute ventilation (P < 0.002) and AHVR (P < 0.003).
Audiovisual stimulation does not prevent the blunting of AHVR by low-dose halothane. This result with halothane differs from previous results with isoflurane. Therefore, different anesthetics interact in different ways with arousal states. This finding raises the possibility that different anesthetics might differentially affect the hypoxic chemoreflex loop or that they might act in the brain at sites separate from the chemoreflex loop, differently to influence the wakefulness drive to ventilation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15564949/

The authors investigated 20 female patients during minor gynecologic surgery. SE, RE, BIS, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and sedation level were recorded every 20 s during stepwise increase (target-controlled infusion, 0.5 microg/ml) of propofol until the patients lost response. Five minutes after loss of response, remifentanil infusion (0.4 microg . kg(-1) . min(-1)) was started. Spearman correlation coefficient and prediction probability were calculated for sedation levels with SE, RE, BIS, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate. The ability of the investigated parameters to distinguish between the anesthesia steps awake versus loss of response, awake versus anesthesia, anesthesia versus first reaction, and anesthesia versus extubation was analyzed with the prediction probability.
SE correlates best with sedation levels, but no significant differences of the prediction probability values among SE, RE, and BIS were found. The prediction probability for all investigated steps of anesthesia did not show significant differences among SE, RE, and BIS.

Two illustrative cases were selected from a pool of 15,000 pediatric and adult patients (ages 8-85 years) who were undergoing corrective spine surgery in operating rooms of university and community hospitals. Anesthesia was maintained with a continuous intravenous infusion of propofol (125-225 microg/kg/min) along with intermittent boluses of narcotic and midazolam (1.0-2.0 mg) as needed. Characteristic metamorphosis of the bilateral posterior tibial nerve cortical somatosensory evoked potential, highlighted by the emergence of an additional middle-latency component labeled the S-wave, served as a neurophysiological marker of ""light"" propofol anesthesia prompting elevation of propofol infusion rate or bolus injection.
The S-wave was routinely abolished with increased propofol infusion rate or bolus injection. In all instances increased propofol concentration levels produced a characteristic morphologic change in the posterior tibial nerve cortical somatosensory evoked potential consistent with a return to adequate anesthetic depth. Selected cases presented herein compare the S-wave technique to BIS and illustrate the usefulness of the S-wave in identifying inadequate depth of propofol anesthesia.
The bilateral posterior tibial nerve cortical somatosensory evoked potential changes its morphology in predictable fashion with decreased depth of propofol anesthesia, allowing for anticipation of imminent anesthetic ""lightening."" It serves as a useful cross-check to Bispectral Index (BIS) or other ""level of consciousness"" EEG-based algorithms for monitoring depth of propofol anesthesia during prolonged corrective spine surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15562986/

After premedication with midazolam and metoclopramide 1 h before surgery, epidural catheter placement, induction of anesthesia with fentanyl and propofol, and tracheal intubation facilitated with succinylcholine, anesthesia was maintained with age-adjusted 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) desflurane or sevoflurane. Fentanyl IV, morphine or local anesthetics epidurally, and vasoactive drugs as needed were used to maintain arterial blood pressure at +/-20% of baseline value and to keep bispectral index of the electroencephalogram values between 40 to 60 U. Although patients were anesthetized with desflurane for a longer time (261 +/- 50 min versus 234 +/- 37 min, mean +/- sd; P < 0.05, desflurane versus sevoflurane, respectively) and for more MAC-hours (4.2 +/- 0.9 h versus 3.7 +/- 0.8 h; P < 0.05), significantly earlier recovery of response to command and tracheal extubation occurred in patients given desflurane than in patients given sevoflurane. The modified Aldrete score was greater in desflurane-anesthetized patients on admission to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) (P = 0.01) but not at discharge (P = 0.47). On admission to PACU, patients given desflurane had higher oxygen saturations (97.0% +/- 2.4%) than patients given sevoflurane (94.8% +/- 4.4%, P = 0.035). Overall, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and the use of antiemetics did not differ between the two anesthetic groups. We conclude that morbidly obese adult patients who underwent major abdominal surgery in a prospective, randomized study awoke significantly faster after desflurane than after sevoflurane anesthesia and the patients anesthetized with desflurane had higher oxygen saturation on entry to the PACU.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15562085/

One hundred patients undergoing sedo-analgesia (midazolam and fentanyl) for interventional gastrointestinal procedures were divided into two groups. In group A (n=30) sedation was guided by the RSS with the operator blinded to the BIS recording. In group B (n=70) the operator titrated intravenous sedation to maintain an optimal BIS, predetermined from the results in group A. Recovery time, procedure duration, physiological parameters and unplanned events were recorded in both groups.
There was a significant correlation between the BIS and RSS (p<0.001). BIS values of 87.2 and 80.9 corresponded to an RSS of 3 and 4, respectively. The optimal BIS level was defined as 80-85. Fifty-seven point five percent of readings were within this range in group B compared with 26.5% in group A (p<0.001). Sedation approaching general anaesthesia (BIS<60) occurred in 5.5% of patients in group A but not in group B. Mean recovery time, duration of procedure, midazolam and fentanyl doses were significantly reduced in group B. Unplanned events were reduced from 27 to 17%, but this was not statistically significant (p=0.29).
BIS monitoring enables more effective titration of sedatives to maintain a suitable level of consciousness, whilst reducing procedure time. The BIS offers an objective, safe and reliable measure of sedation, without disturbing either patient or operator. BIS monitoring raises the standard of patient care, and in our view, should be used to augment standard assessment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15556593/

Resulting differences in anesthetic depth might affect the stress response to surgery involving neural circuitry not reflected in the electroencephalogram.
Forty patients scheduled to undergo elective coronary artery bypass grafting receiving a background infusion of remifentanil (0.3 microg . kg . min) were anesthetized with intravenous propofol delivered by target-controlled infusion according to the Marsh pharmacokinetic model under BIS monitoring. In a randomized, prospective design, 20 patients received propofol at a target concentration of 3 microg/ml, whereas in 20 patients propofol was titrated to maintain a BIS value of 40-50. Plasma concentrations of propofol (by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), epinephrine, norepinephrine (by means of high-pressure liquid chromatography), cortisol (by means of radioimmunoassay), and interleukins 6 and 10 (by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were measured repeatedly throughout surgery.
BIS monitoring allowed a 30% reduction of propofol infusion rates and a similar decrease in plasma propofol concentrations in the BIS group without affecting the stress response to surgery for the group mean. None of the patients reported awareness during a standardized interview. Interestingly, propofol-remifentanil anesthesia blunted the release of epinephrine and cortisol to bypass surgery completely even when the propofol infusion rate was reduced according to BIS values.
Total intravenous anesthesia using propofol-remifentanil effectively attenuates the neurohumoral stress response to coronary bypass surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass. Titration of propofol using BIS allows for significant reduction of propofol consumption, with only minor effects on stress response under these conditions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15505444/

This study compared the respiratory effect of dexmedetomidine to that of remifentanil. The authors measured and compared respiratory responses of six healthy male volunteers during (1) a stepwise target-controlled infusion of remifentanil, (2) a stepwise target-controlled infusion of dexmedetomidine, and (3) a pseudonatural sleep session.
Compared with baseline, remifentanil infusions resulted in respiratory depression as evidenced by a decrease in respiratory rate and minute ventilation, respiratory acidosis, and apnea episodes resulting in desaturations. Remifentanil disturbed the natural pattern of breathing and flattened the distribution of ventilatory timing (inspiratory time/ventilatory cycle time). The respiratory effects of dexmedetomidine markedly contrasted with those of remifentanil. When compared with baseline, during dexmedetomidine infusions, the respiratory rate significantly increased, and the overall apnea/hypopnea index significantly decreased. The distribution of inspiratory time/ventilatory cycle time showed an increased peak. In addition, dexmedetomidine seemed to mimic some aspect of natural sleep. While the subjects were breathing a 5% CO2 mixture, hypercapnic arousal phenomena (documented by the Bispectral Index, the electroencephalogram, and sudden increase in the minute ventilation) were observed during dexmedetomidine infusions. Similar phenomena during natural sleep have been reported in the literature.

In this study, we investigated whether guided imagery of relatively short duration would decrease S-Anxiety and electroencephalogram Bispectral Index and improve working memory. 42 participants (age: M=39, SD=11, 14 men, 28 women, university students and VA Medical Center employees, recruited by their professor or by fellow employees) underwent relaxation by 16-min. guided imagery or no treatment (control). Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the WAIS-III Letter-Number Sequencing Test were administered before and after relaxation. S-Anxiety and BIS Index decreased and the Letter-Number test score increased by 30% after relaxation but not in the control group. This score was higher for participants with low anxiety and BIS Index. There was no significant difference between the groups before treatment.

The authors compared the performance of the Narcotrend index (software version 4.0) to the Bispectral Index (BIS, version XP; Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA) as electroencephalographic measures of isoflurane drug effect during general anesthesia.
The authors observed 15 adult patients scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy with a combined epidural-isoflurane general anesthesia technique. At least 45 min after induction of general anesthesia, during a phase of constant surgical stimulation, end-tidal isoflurane concentrations were varied between 0.5 and 2.0 multiples of minimum alveolar concentration, and the BIS and the Narcotrend index were recorded. The prediction probability (PK) was calculated for the BIS and the Narcotrend index to predict isoflurane effect compartment concentration for each measure. The correlation analysis of the BIS and the Narcotrend index with the isoflurane effect compartment concentration was obtained by pharmacodynamic modeling based on two sigmoidal curves to account for the discontinuity in both indices with the onset of burst suppression.
The prediction probabilities were indistinguishable (BIS PK = 0.72 +/- 0.07 (mean +/- SD); range, 0.61-0.84; Narcotrend index PK = 0.72 +/- 0.10; range, 0.51-0.87), as were the correlations between the electroencephalographic measures and isoflurane effect compartment concentrations (BIS R = 0.82 +/- 0.12; Narcotrend index R = 0.85 +/- 0.09). The pharmacodynamic models for the BIS and the Narcotrend index yielded nearly identical results.

The study verified the 2 previously published BIS/N2O investigations showing no correlation between N2O dosage up to 70% and BIS. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation scores (OAA/S), however, correlated well with increasing doses of N2O from approximately 35 to 70%. A near linear dose-response relationship was established between OAA/S and end tidal (ET) sevoflurane concentrations of 0.4-0.7%. Only at the highest level of end tidal sevoflurane recorded, 0.7%, was statistically significant BIS depression seen. Subjects evaluated the acceptability of the sedative effect of the 2 gases, showing a slight preference for N2O. Comparable partial anterograde amnesia and sedation (OAA/S) were produced by both agents in administered concentrations of 40-70% N2O and 0.6-0.8% sevoflurane. Female subjects exhibited better memory and significantly less amnesia than males. No statistically significant changes occurred in any of the monitored vital signs. EMG readings demonstrated a statistically significant difference from control values only at the highest, 0.7%, ET concentration of sevoflurane.

Quantifying the blink reflex may reflect the depression of reflex arches induced by anaesthetics and thus being informative on the anaesthetic state.
The relation between the electrically evoked blink reflexes and the depth of sedation and anaesthesia induced with intravenous propofol was investigated. Twenty patients received propofol by target-controlled infusion to create a stepwise deepening of sedation and anaesthesia. Depth of anaesthesia was assessed using the observer's assessment of anaesthesia and sedation (OAAS) scale, and by bispectral EEG analysis (BIS). Probit analysis was used to estimate the predicted propofol effect site concentrations producing unconsciousness, no response to noxious stimulation, and loss of blink reflex components.
Latency of the first (R1) and second (R2) blink component increased, whereas duration and area decreased with increasing depth of sedation and anaesthesia. A reasonably strong correlation between OAAS and the areas of R1 and R2 components was found (Spearman's rho = 0.92 and 0.89). The areas of R1 and R2 and the OAAS also correlated with BIS (Spearman's rho = 0.91, 0.88 and 0.90). EC(50) and EC(95) for loss of R1 were 2.8 (95% CI: 2.5-3.2) micro g/ml and 4.6 (95% CI: 4.1-5.5) micro g/ml, respectively.
Our results suggest that the differential sensitivity of the components of the blink reflex could be useful in monitoring depth of sedation and light levels of anaesthesia during the administration of propofol.

Three groups of 20 patients received an effect-site controlled propofol infusion (Ce(PROP)) starting at 1 microg ml(-1) and increased in steps of 0.5 microg ml(-1) at 4 min intervals. In addition, a remifentanil infusion was maintained at a group-dependent, fixed effect-site target concentration (Ce(REMI)) (0, 2 or 4 ng ml(-1)). The ability of BIS, SE or RE to predict LOR(verbal) and LOR(noxious) were compared with the changes in BIS, SE and RE using logistic regression, prediction probability (P(K)), and sensitivity/specificity.
In all groups, BIS, SE and RE decreased with increasing Ce(PROP). However, BIS decreased more smoothly than SE and RE at deeper levels of sedation. At LOR(verbal), BIS(50), SE(50) and RE(50) increased with increasing Ce(REMI). BIS, SE and RE all detected LOR(verbal) accurately but BIS performed better at 100% sensitivity. Sensitivity/specificity for detection of LOR(verbal) decreased for all methods with increasing Ce(REMI). LOR(noxious) was poorly described by all measures.
LOR(verbal) was detected accurately by BIS, SE and RE except for 100% sensitivity, where BIS performed better.

The purpose of this study was to compare the changes of the A-line ARX index and the bispectral index during sevoflurane - nitrous oxide anesthesia.
One hundred females aged 30-60 years, and scheduled for partial mastectomy, were divided into two groups. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane 5% and nitrous oxide in oxygen for 3 min. A laryngeal mask airway was inserted, and anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 1-2% and nitrous oxide in oxygen.

Transferring guidelines for titrating the Bispectral Index (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems, USA, version XP) to the NCT index depends on their comparability. We compared the relationship between BIS and NCT values during propofol anaesthesia.
Eighteen adult patients about to have radical prostatectomy were investigated. An epidural catheter was placed in the lumbar space and electrodes for BIS and NCT were applied as recommended by the manufacturers. After i.v. fentanyl 0.1 mg, anaesthesia was induced with a propofol infusion. After intubation, patients received bupivacaine 0.5% 15 ml via the epidural catheter. Forty-five minutes after induction, the propofol concentration was increased to substantial burst suppression pattern and then decreased. This was done twice in each patient, and BIS and Narcotrend values were recorded at intervals of 5 s. The efficacy of NCT and BIS in predicting consciousness vs unconsciousness was evaluated using the prediction probability (P(K)).
We collected 38 629 artefact-free data pairs of BIS and NCT values from the respective 5-s epochs. Because of artefacts, another 5008 epochs had been excluded from data analysis (3855 epochs for the NCT index alone, 245 epochs for the BIS alone and 908 epochs for both indices). Mean (sd) values in awake patients were 94 (6) for Narcotrend and 91 (8) for BIS. With loss of the eyelash reflex, both values were significantly reduced, to 72 (9) for NCT (P<0.001) and to 77 (11) for the BIS index (P<0.001). The PK value for loss of eyelash reflex was similar for BIS (0.95) and NCT (0.93). Decreasing BIS values coincided with decreasing NCT values. A sigmoid model [NCT index=52.8+26.8/(1+exp(-(BIS-78.3)/4.8))(0.4); r=0.52] described the correlation between BIS and NCT index in a BIS range between 100 and 50. For BIS values lower than 50, a second sigmoid model with a correlation of r=0.83 was applied [NCT index=6.6+45.3/(1+exp(-(BIS-29.8)/2.4)) (0.6) r=0.83]. The relationship between burst suppression ratio (BSR) and NCT index was best described by the following sigmoid model: NCT index=265/(1+exp((-BSR+108)/-49); r=0.73.
We found a sufficient correlation between BIS and NCT index, but deviations from the line of identity in some ranges require attention. Therefore, a simple 1:1 transfer from BIS to NCT values is not adequate.

The Bispectral Index System (BIS) is an EEG monitor that measures the level of sedation. The authors compared discharge times of patients who had BIS monitoring to those who did not to determine if the use of BIS speeded discharge.
After IRB approval, 20 children were enrolled. BIS was monitored continuously from admission until discharge. Each child received ketamine, midazolam, and glycopyrrolate i.m. Once sedated, the patient was transferred to the operating room, monitored, and i.v. access was established. GA proceeded with sevoflurane, rocuronium, and fentanyl. Randomly, in half the patients, the anesthesiologist knew and maintained the BIS at GA level of sedation by adjusting sevoflurane. In the rest, the anesthesiologist did not know BIS. Time from turning of sevoflurane to discharge was noted and compared.
Patients where the BIS was known and used were discharged 60+/-13 minutes after the end of GA. Patients where BIS was unknown were discharged 90+/-11 minutes after the end of GA (P<.001).

Twenty healthy volunteers received either propofol or remifentanil alone and then concurrently with a fixed concentration of remifentanil or propofol, respectively, via a target-controlled infusion. Responses to shaking and shouting and to laryngoscopy were assessed multiple times after allowing for plasma effect site equilibration. The raw electroencephalogram and BIS were recorded throughout the study, and AE was calculated off-line. Response surfaces were fit to the clinical response data using logistic regression or hierarchical response models. Response surfaces were also estimated for BIS and AE. Surfaces were visualized using three-dimensional rotations. Model parameters were estimated with NONMEM.
Remifentanil alone had no appreciable effect on response to shaking and shouting or response to laryngoscopy. Propofol could ablate both responses. Modest remifentanil concentrations dramatically reduced the concentrations of propofol required to ablate both responses. The hierarchical response surface described the data better than empirical logistic regression. BIS and AE are more sensitive to propofol than to remifentanil.
Remifentanil alone is ineffective at ablating response to stimuli but demonstrates potent synergy with propofol. BIS and AE values corresponding to 95% probability of ablating response are influenced by the combination of propofol and remifentanil to achieve this endpoint, with higher propofol concentrations producing lower values for BIS and AE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15166553/

Fifty-one TLE patients were submitted to successful anterior-mesial temporal lobectomy. Univariate (UVA) and multivariate (MVA) analysis were performed upon clinical data, distribution of interictal spikes, and ictal chronology of seizures. From MVA, a final predictive model (FPM) was determined to better predict TPP and APP. Forty patients showed TPP (78.5%) and 11 patients APP (21.5%). Accuracy of ictal SPECT was higher in the unilateral (UIS) than in the bilateral (BIS) interictal spikes group (P = 0.05). FPM showed that patients exhibiting BIS, with shorter proportion of the electrographic seizure occurring after completion of tracer injection, and longer clinical than EEG seizure duration had more APP (P = 0.003). Generalized tonic-clonic seizures did not result in more APP.

We present a case of an 8-mo-old infant with Hunter's syndrome who was maintained on very large doses of fentanyl and midazolam and who could not be weaned from these drugs by conventional taper. We used dexmedetomidine, an alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, to facilitate opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal. A processed electroencephalogram (Bispectral Index) was used to guide the titration of dexmedetomidine in this neurologically impaired infant.

This study compared BIS levels to well-validated clinical measures of arousal and the presence or absence of delirium.
A prospective, blinded, observational cohort study.
124 mechanically ventilated, adult, medical ICU patients.
Using BIS 3.4 and BIS-XP 4.0 algorithms, BIS values were calculated immediately prior to clinical assessments. The clinical assessments included the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and presence or absence of delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. A total of 484 assessments were collected among 124 patients. BIS-XP values demonstrated greater correlation with RASS than BIS 3.4 ( R(2)=0.36 vs. 0.20), although considerable overlap of BIS-XP scores remained across RASS levels. Median BIS-XP values for delirious and nondelirious observations were 74 and 96, respectively, while BIS 3.4 values were 91 and 96, respectively. However, neither BIS 3.4 nor BIS-XP were significantly associated with delirium after controlling for RASS value.
In comparison with clinical measures of arousal in mechanically ventilated patients, BIS-XP algorithm demonstrated stronger correlation with RASS levels than did BIS 3.4, yet marked overlap across different levels of arousal persist using both algorithms. After controlling for level of arousal, neither BIS-XP nor BIS 3.4 algorithms distinguished between the presence and absence of delirium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15127189/

Ninety females scheduled for mastectomy were divided into three groups. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl to insert a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and was maintained by adding nitrous oxide. EEG was monitored by either BIS, spectral edge frequency by pEEG, or A-AEP index by A-AEP. We recorded the number of patients with impedance low enough to extract good EEG signals at the first electrodes application (success rate), the number with an index outside of the range considered appropriate for general anesthesia (inappropriateness rate), changes of the index by LMA insertion or surgical incision (responsiveness), and time to return to good EEG signals after signal disturbance by electric cautery (recovery time). The success rate was larger in BIS > or = A-AEP > pEEG. The inappropriateness rate was smaller in A-AEP < or = BIS , or = pEEG. The A-AEP group showed the largest responsiveness. The recovery time was shorter in pEEG < A-AEP < BIS. In summary, the BIS had the largest success rate, the A-AEP had the least inappropriateness rate and the largest responsiveness, and the pEEG had the fastest recovery time.

However, the exact algorithm used to synthesize the parameters to BIS values is not known. The relationship between BIS and EEG parameters was evaluated during nitrous oxide/isoflurane anesthesia. Twenty patients scheduled for elective ophthalmic surgery were enrolled in the study. After EEG recording with a BIS monitor (A-1050) was begun, general anesthesia was induced and maintained with 0.5%-2% isoflurane and 66% nitrous oxide. Using software we developed, we continuously recorded BIS, spectral edge frequency 95% (SEF95), and EEG parameters such as relative beta ratio (BetaRatio), relative synchrony of fast and slow wave (SynchFastSlow), and burst suppression ratio. BetaRatio was linearly correlated with BIS (r = 0.90; P < 0.01; n = 253) at BIS more than 60. At a BIS range of 30 to 80, SynchFastSlow (r = 0.60; P < 0.01; n = 3314) and SEF95 (r = 0.75; P < 0.01; n = 3339) were linearly correlated with BIS. The correlation between BIS and SEF95 was significantly better than the correlation between BIS and SynchFastSlow (P < 0.01). At BIS less than 30, the burst suppression ratio was inversely linearly correlated with BIS (r = 0.76; P < 0.01; n = 65). At BIS less than 80, burst-compensated SEF95 was linearly correlated with BIS (r = 0.78; P < 0.01; n = 3404). In the range of BIS from 60 to 100, BIS can be calculated from BetaRatio. At surgical levels of anesthesia, BIS and SynchFastSlow (a parameter derived from bispectral analysis) or burst-compensated SEF95 (derived from power spectral analysis) are well correlated. However, our results show that SynchFastSlow has no advantage over SEF95 in calculation of BIS.

The precise concentration-dependence of H-reflex suppression by anaesthetics, however, is not known. Here we investigated this concentration-response relationship and the equilibration between the alveolar and the effect compartment for sevoflurane.
In 26 patients, the H-reflex was recorded at a frequency of 0.1 Hz while anaesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane at increasing and decreasing concentrations. Population pharmacodynamic modelling was performed using the NONMEM software package, yielding population mean parameters as well as indicators of interindividual variability.
Suppression of H-reflex amplitude occurred at lower concentrations (mean EC(50) 1.04 +/- 0.10 vol%, SE of NONMEM estimate) than the effect on either BIS or SEF(95) of the EEG (mean EC(50) 1.55 +/- 0.08 and 1.72 +/- 0.18 vol%, respectively), and exhibited a higher interindividual variability. The concentration-response function for the H-reflex was also steeper (mean ë 2.83 +/- 0.25). In addition, the equilibration between alveolar and effect compartment was slower for the H-reflex (mean k(e0) 0.15 +/- 0.01 min(-1)) than for BIS or SEF(95) (mean k(e0) 0.22 +/- 0.02 and 0.41 +/- 0.05 min(-1)).
The differences in EC(50) and slope of the concentration-response relationships for H-reflex suppression and the EEG parameters point to different underlying mechanisms. In addition, the differences in time constant for equilibration between alveolar and effect compartment confirm the notion that immobility is caused at a different anatomic site than suppression of the EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15101850/

We examined the relationship between bispectral index (BIS) score and seizure duration in ECT performed under thiopental anesthesia in patients receiving their usual regimen of antidepressant medication for its potential as a predictor of seizure inducibility. One-hundred ECT treatments were evaluated in 16 adult patients diagnosed with depression. BIS scores were recorded at the preanesthetic and preictal periods and at recovery from ECT. Seizure duration was defined as the duration of the electroencephalogram seizure pattern. The relationships between preanesthetic and preictal BIS scores and seizure duration were evaluated. Effective seizure threshold was determined by receiver operator characteristic analysis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for seizure durations of more than 10 s, more than 20 s, and more than 30 s. The relationship between seizure duration and thiopental estimated effect-site and plasma concentrations was analyzed as well. Preictal BIS scores for seizures lasting longer than 30 s were significantly higher than those for seizures lasting <30 s. A preictal BIS score of 55 or more represents a strongly determinant condition for achieving seizures that last longer than 30 s (AUC, 0.937; receiver operator characteristic), as well as for briefer seizures that last more than 20 or 10 s (AUC: 0.938 and 0.959, respectively). There was no significant correlation between seizure duration and the estimated thiopental effect-site or plasma concentration. We conclude that during thiopental anesthesia, the minimum threshold for inducing seizures of any duration correlates with a preictal BIS score of 55. This threshold was independent of antidepressant regimen and thiopental dosage. We suggest that the preictal BIS score is useful in predicting the ictogenic threshold in ECT.
We found that the bispectral index (BIS) score serves as an indicator of seizure inducibility in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) under thiopental anesthesia and that the relationship between BIS score and seizure duration was not linear, suggesting that the pharmacological mechanisms by which thiopental and propofol suppress ECT seizure activity are different.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15041593/

Two Entropy parameters are described: Response entropy (RE) is calculated from EEG and FEMG; and State Entropy (SE) is calculated mainly from EEG. This study was performed to validate their performance during transition from consciousness to unconsciousness under different anesthetic agents.
Response entropy, SE [S/5 Entropy Module, M-ENTROPY (later in text: Entropy), Datex-Ohmeda Division, Instrumentarium Corp., Helsinki, Finland] and BIS (BIS XP, A-2000, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA) data were collected from 70 patients; 30 anesthetized with propofol 2 mg kg-1, 20 with sevoflurane inhalation, and 20 with thiopental 5 mg kg-1. Loss and regaining of consciousness (LOC, ROC) was tested every 10 s, and sensitivity, specificity, and prediction probability (Pk) were calculated. Behavior of the indices was studied.
Sensitivity, specificity, and Pk values for consciousness were high and similar for all indices. During regaining of consciousness after propofol bolus, RE, SE, and BIS values recovered by 81 +/- 22%, 75 +/- 26%, and 59 +/- 18% (mean +/- SD), respectively, from the minimum relative to their baseline. After thiopental bolus, RE, SE, and BIS values recovered by 86+/-21%, 88 +/- 13%, and 63 +/- 14%, respectively. The relative rise was higher in RE and SE compared with BIS (P < 0.01). During deep levels of hypnosis, RE and SE decreased monotonously as a function of burst suppression ratio, while BIS showed biphasic behavior. On average, RE indicated emergence from anesthesia 11 s earlier than SE, and 12.4 s earlier than BIS.
All indices, RE, SE, and BIS, distinguished excellently between conscious and unconscious states during propofol, sevoflurane, and thiopental anesthesia. During burst suppression, Entropy parameters RE and SE, but not BIS, behave monotonously.

We report a case where a patient with presumed ischemic brain injury and an extremely low BIS had an unexplained increase in BIS that could be attributed to electrocardiogram artifact. Care should be taken when interpreting BIS in the setting of anoxic-ischemic brain injury or brain death.

Its newest software version 4.0 includes a dimensionless index that, similar to the bispectral index (BIS), ranges from 100 (awake) to 0. We compared the performance of Narcotrend index and BIS as EEG measures of anesthetic drug effect during propofol anesthesia. Eighteen adult patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy were investigated. An epidural catheter was placed in the lumbar space and electrodes for BIS (version XP; Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA) and Narcotrend were positioned as recommended by the manufacturers. Narcotrend index, BIS values, and propofol plasma and effect site concentrations as parallelly simulated by Rugloop software (Department of Anesthesia, Ghent University, Belgium) were automatically recorded in intervals of 5 s. Induction of anesthesia consisted of a fentanyl bolus and a propofol infusion. After endotracheal intubation, patients received 15 mL bupivacaine 0.5% epidurally, and 45 min later propofol dosages were subsequently increased and decreased twice. Simulated propofol effect site concentrations ranged from 2.0 +/- 0.4 microg/mL (smallest) to 6.3 +/- 1.3 microg/mL (largest) during these subsequent increases and decreases of propofol. In terms of prediction probability (P(K)) the performance of the Narcotrend index (P(K) = 0.88 +/- 0.03) to predict propofol effect site concentrations was comparable to the BIS (P(K) = 0.85 +/- 0.04). Using the respective EEG index as a measure of drug effect the mean k(e0) was calculated as 0.20 +/- 0.05 min(-1) for Narcotrend index and 0.16 +/- 0.07 min(-1) for BIS. In the observed propofol concentration range Narcotrend index detected differences in EEG dynamics as well as BIS.
This study in 18 adult patients undergoing radical prostatectomy describes the relationship between Narcotrend index and bispectral index versus predicted propofol effect compartment concentrations.

Children were allocated randomly to receive rectal midazolam 0.4 mg kg(-1) (n=20) or oral clonidine 4 microg kg(-1) (n=20) as premedication. Rapid induction of anaesthesia was achieved with inhalation of sevoflurane 8% in nitrous oxide 50%-oxygen 50%. After tracheal intubation, the children's lungs were mechanically ventilated and the inspired sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to achieve an end-tidal fraction of 2.5%. The EEG and BIS were recorded during induction until 10 min after tracheal intubation. The EEG was analysed using spectral analysis at five points: baseline, loss of eyelash reflex, 15 s before the nadir of the BIS (BIS(nadir)), when both pupils returned to the central position (immediately before intubation), and 10 min after intubation.
Agitation was observed in 12 midazolam-treated and five clonidine-treated patients (P=0.05). At baseline, EEG rhythms were slower in the clonidine group. Induction of anaesthesia was associated with similar EEG changes in the two groups, with an increase in total spectral power and a shift towards low frequencies; these changes were maximal around the end of the second minute of induction (BIS(nadir)). When the pupils had returned to the central position, fast EEG rhythms increased and BIS was higher than BIS(nadir) (P<0.05). In both groups, agitation was associated with an increase in slow EEG rhythms at BIS(nadir).
Compared with midazolam, clonidine premedication reduced agitation during sevoflurane induction. During induction with sevoflurane 8% (oxygen 50%-nitrous oxide 50%), the nadir of the BIS occurred at the end of the second minute of inhalation. Agitation was associated with a more pronounced slowing of the EEG rhythms at BIS(nadir) compared with inductions in which no agitation was observed.

The present study evaluated whether there is concordance between the bispectral and the patient state indices with regard to end-points measured simultaneously in patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia.
Fifty-seven patients scheduled for elective abdominal, orthopaedic (Groups 1 and 2) or cardiac surgery (Group 3) under general anaesthesia were enrolled in the study. Anaesthesia was performed using remifentanil/ sevoflurane (Group 1, 19 patients), remifentanil/propofol (Group 2, 19 patients) or sufentanil/propofol/isoflurane (Group 3, 19 patients). The bispectral and the patient state indices were simultaneously recorded. Pearson's correlation between these two indices was calculated for the complete data and each group. The percentage of bispectral index values in the recommended range for general anaesthesia (45-60) that were confirmed by levels of patient state index (25-50) was calculated and vice versa.
Overall correlation between the bispectral and the patient state indices was 0.667, 0.671 in Group 1, 0.650 in Group 2 and 0.675 in Group 3 (P < 0.01). For values of the bispectral index between 45 and 60, only 40% of corresponding patient state index values were between 25 and 50.

14747816,Bispectral index monitoring quantifies depth of sedation during emergency department procedural sedation and analgesia in children.,Annals of emergency medicine,2004,"Agrawal D, Feldman HA, Krauss B, Waltzman ML","The bispectral index monitor uses processed electroencephalogram signals to measure sedation depth on a unitless scale from 0 to 100 (0, coma; 40 to 60, general anesthesia; 60 to 90, sedated; 100, awake). It has been validated in the operating room as an objective measure of sedation depth with nondissociative general anesthesia; however, its usefulness in the pediatric emergency department (ED) for procedural sedation and analgesia has not been established. We determine the ability of the bispectral index to monitor depth of nondissociative procedural sedation and analgesia in children.
This was an observational study conducted in a children's hospital ED. Procedural sedation and analgesia was performed in the standard manner, with the addition of bispectral index monitoring and simultaneous clinical sedation scoring (modified Ramsay Sedation Scale [range 1 to 8; 1=alert, 8=unresponsive]). Paired bispectral index and Ramsay Sedation Scale scores were assigned every 5 minutes during the sedation. Ramsay Sedation Scale scores were assigned by a single study investigator blinded to the bispectral index score. An emergency physician independently administered all medications for procedural sedation and analgesia. The correlation between the paired bispectral index/Ramsay Sedation Scale scores was determined by using a repeated-measures regression analysis. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the ability of the bispectral index to discriminate various thresholds of sedation depth.
A convenience sample of 20 patients was enrolled, providing 217 paired bispectral index/Ramsay Sedation Scale measurements. Median age was 4.6 years (range 0.4 to 16.7 years). Fourteen patients received midazolam with fentanyl; the remainder received pentobarbital. Bispectral index scores ranged from 40 to 98 (mean 81.6+/-16.1). Ramsay Sedation Scale scores ranged from 1 to 8 (median 3; interquartile range 2 to 4). The simple Pearson correlation between paired bispectral index and Ramsay Sedation Scale scores was -0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.83 to -0.72; P<.001). After adjustment for the nonindependence of intrapatient data with bivariate repeated-measures analysis, the correlation was -0.67 (95% CI -0.90 to -0.43; P<.001). The linear regression coefficient between bispectral index and Ramsay Sedation Scale scores was estimated to be between -5.7 and -12.7. ROC curve analysis demonstrated moderate to high discriminatory power of bispectral index scores in predicting level of sedation throughout the sedation continuum, with areas under the curve at least 0.87 for all Ramsay Sedation Scale score thresholds. Bispectral index scores between 60 and 90 predicted with moderate accuracy traditional clinical levels of sedation typically encountered during procedural sedation and analgesia in the pediatric ED.
Bispectral index monitoring correlated with clinical sedation scores and may serve as a useful, objective adjunct in quantifying depth of nondissociative procedural sedation and analgesia in children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14747816/

The BIS was created after concurrent collection of EEG and clinical data from a large number of patients anesthetized with various drugs over a prolonged period and then performing a Fourier analysis followed by a bispectral calculation. The clinical stages of anesthetic depth are very well demonstrated in etherized patients. In this study, we studied the BIS changes during various stages of ether anesthesia and quantified the hypnotic depth during the surgical stage of ether anesthesia. The values for BIS under various stages and planes of ether anesthesia were recorded in 21 patients listed for short surgical procedures. During diethyl ether anesthesia, BIS initially increased and subsequently decreased. During surgical anesthesia, a BIS value of 30 was observed.
For the first time, bispectral index (BIS) has been studied in patients being anesthetized solely with ether. Ether both causes an increase and decrease in BIS during induction and emergence. The index observed during the surgical stage of ether anesthesia is probably the correct value for the depth of hypnosis because no other volatile anesthetic can produce the true anesthetic state when used alone. This value could be taken as the value to be attained when balanced anesthesia is being practiced.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14693605/

Halothane is still used in paediatric anaesthesia. Compared with other volatile anaesthetics, halothane has a different receptor affinity and differing effects on the EEG. There are limited data evaluating the BIS with halothane. We set out to compare the BIS using halothane and isoflurane at a clinically relevant equipotent concentration (1 MAC) and at a reproducible measure of anaesthetic effect (awakening).
Forty children aged between 2 and 15 yr were enrolled in a masked randomized trial-20 in each group. Anaesthesia was induced with sevoflurane or propofol. Either halothane or isoflurane were given to obtain an end-tidal concentration of 1 MAC for 15 min. The BIS was then recorded. The BIS was also recorded at awakening. Values (mean (SD)) were compared with a t test.
At 1 MAC the BIS for halothane was significantly greater than isoflurane (56.5 (8.1) vs 35.9 (8.5), P<0.0001). At awakening there was no significant difference (BIS halothane; 81.1 (11.9), BIS isoflurane; 82.5 (16.4)). The difference in means at awakening was 1.4 (95% CI -8.2 to 11.1).
At equipotent concentrations of halothane and isoflurane BIS valves were significantly greater with halothane. At awakening the BIS values were equivalent for each agent. This finding is consistent with the BIS being more affected by the agent used at higher concentrations of anaesthetic. The BIS must be interpreted with caution when using halothane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14665547/

Because the changes in bispectrum are affected by signal amplitude, we also calculated a third parameter (SFSbicoh) from the bicoherence, which is an amplitude-independent statistic.
The SynchFastSlow and PowerFastSlow were correlated (r=0.84) and neither was superior in predicting the awake or anaesthetized state (area under receiver operating characteristic curves = 0.85 vs 0.93). There was no change in the SFSbicoh over the induction period, and it did not correlate with SynchFastSlow (r=0.07).
We could not show that bispectral analysis gave more information than power spectral-based analysis. Most of the changes in the bispectral values result from decreases in the relative high frequency content of the EEG caused by anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14665546/
14650640,Does the EEG during isoflurane/alfentanil anesthesia differ from linear random data?,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2002,"Schwilden H, Jeleazcov C","Bispectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used to monitor depth of anesthesia. In the majority of publications this has been done using the so called Bispectral (BIS) Index. The exact relation of this index to bispectral quantities like the bispectrum and its normalized version the bicoherence has not yet been published. In case the EEG is a linear random process the bicoherence is trivial. It is a mere constant independent of the EEG frequency. If the signal is a linear Gaussian random process this constant is zero. In this case both the bispectrum and bicoherence are zero. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of EEG epochs with non-trivial bicoherence during anesthesia with isoflurane/nitrous oxide.
We reanalyzed 26.4 hr of EEG signal recorded in 8 patients during anesthesia for general abdominal surgery which were stored in digitized form on CD-Rom. The test developed by Hinich for Gaussianity and linearity was applied to these data. The test was validated with various kinds of surrogate data; especially the phase randomized (pr) EEG, synthetic Gaussian random data and the z-component of the Lorenz attractor and its pr version.
The proportion of epochs for which a non-trivial bicoherence was detected by the test was as follows: Lorenz data 95%, pr Lorenz data 5%, synthetic Gaussian data 13.8%, pr EEG 5.4%, original EEG 6.2%.
As expected the test procedure correctly identified for the Lorenz data for 95% of all epochs a non-trivial bicoherence. For the original EEG data we could not find a significant greater percentage of epochs with non-trivial bicoherence than for the pr data and the synthetic Gaussian data. We conclude that the EEG during anesthesia with isoflurane/alfentanil appears to be largely a linear random process.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14650640/

However, there is controversy regarding the impact of the alleged anesthetic-sparing effects of cerebral monitoring on the recovery process and patient outcome. We designed this prospective double-blinded, sham-controlled study to evaluate the impact of intraoperative monitoring with the electroencephalogram bispectral index (BIS) or auditory evoked potential (AEP) device on the usage of desflurane and the time to discharge from the recovery room, as well as on patient satisfaction with their anesthetic experience and recovery. Ninety healthy patients undergoing laparoscopic general surgery procedures using a standardized anesthetic technique were randomly assigned to one of three monitoring groups: standard clinical practice (control), BIS-guided, or AEP-guided. Both the BIS and AEP monitors were connected to all patients before induction of general anesthesia. In the control group, the anesthesiologists were not permitted to observe the BIS or AEP index values during the intraoperative period. In the BIS-guided group, the volatile anesthetic was titrated to maintain a BIS value in the range of 45-55. In the AEP-guided group, the targeted AEP index range was 15-20. The BIS and AEP indices, as well as end-tidal desflurane concentration, were recorded at 3-5 min intervals. Recovery times to awakening, tracheal extubation, fast-track score >or=12, and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge criteria were recorded at 1-10 min intervals. In addition, patient satisfaction with anesthesia and quality of recovery were evaluated on 100- and 18-point scales, respectively, at 24 h after surgery. The AEP- and BIS-guided groups were administered significantly smaller average end-tidal desflurane concentrations than the control group (3.8 +/- 0.9 and 3.9 +/- 0.6 versus 4.7 +/- 1.7, respectively) (P < 0.01). Although the emergence times to eye opening, tracheal extubation, and obeying commands were consistently shorter in the AEP and BIS groups (6 +/- 4 and 6 +/- 5 versus 8 +/- 8 min; 6 +/- 5 and 6 +/- 4 versus 11 +/- 10 min; and 8 +/- 4 and 7 +/- 4 versus 12 +/- 9 min, respectively), only the extubation times were significantly different from the control group (P < 0.05). More importantly, the length of the PACU stay was significantly shorter in both the AEP- and BIS-guided groups (79 +/- 43 and 80 +/- 47 versus 108 +/- 58 min, respectively) (P < 0.05). The patients' quality of recovery was also significantly higher in the two monitored groups (15 +/- 2 versus 13 +/- 3 in the control group, P < 0.05). We concluded that cerebral monitoring with either the BIS or AEP devices reduced the maintenance anesthetic (desflurane) requirement, resulting in a shorter length of stay in the PACU and improved quality of recovery after laparoscopic surgery. However, there were no significant outcome differences between the two cerebral monitored groups.
Compared with standard monitoring practices, use of an auditory evoked potential or bispectral index monitor to titrate the volatile anesthetic led to a significant reduction in the anesthetic requirement. The anesthetic-sparing effect of cerebral monitoring resulted in a shorter postanesthesia care unit stay and improved quality of recovery from the patient's perspective.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14633540/
14633533,The effect of intraoperative use of esmolol and nicardipine on recovery after ambulatory surgery.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2003,"White PF, Wang B, Tang J, Wender RH, Naruse R, Sloninsky A","There is controversy regarding the optimal technique for maintaining hemodynamic stability during anesthesia. We designed this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to test the hypothesis that the technique used for maintaining hemodynamic stability during general anesthesia can influence recovery after ambulatory surgery. Forty-five healthy consenting women undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy procedures were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: Group 1 (control, n = 15) received normal saline 5 mL and 1 mL, followed by a saline infusion at a rate of 0.005 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1); Group 2 (n = 15) received esmolol 50 mg and saline 1 mL, followed by an esmolol infusion 5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1); and Group 3 (n = 15) received esmolol 50 mg and nicardipine 1 mg, followed by an esmolol infusion 5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). The study drugs were administered after the induction of anesthesia with fentanyl 1.5 microg/kg, and propofol 2 mg/kg I.V. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium 0.12 mg/kg I.V. Anesthesia was initially maintained with desflurane 2% end-tidal and N(2)O 67% in oxygen in all 3 groups. During surgery, the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained within +/-15% of the baseline value by varying the study drug infusion rate and the inspired concentration of desflurane. In addition to MAP and heart rate values, electroencephalogram bispectral index values were recorded throughout the perioperative period. Recovery times and postoperative side effects were assessed. Compared with the control group, adjunctive use of esmolol and nicardipine attenuated the increase in heart rate (in Group 2) and MAP (in Group 3) after tracheal intubation. Furthermore, the use of an esmolol infusion as an adjunct to desflurane to control the acute autonomic responses during the maintenance period significantly decreased emergence times (4 +/- 2 versus 7 +/- 4 min), decreased the need for postoperative opioid analgesics (43% versus 80%), and reduced the time to discharge (209 +/- 89 versus 269 +/- 100 min). We conclude that the adjunctive use of esmolol alone or in combination with nicardipine during the induction of anesthesia reduced the hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation. Furthermore, use of an esmolol infusion as an adjuvant to desflurane-N(2)O anesthesia for controlling the acute hemodynamic responses during the maintenance period improved the recovery profile after outpatient laparoscopic surgery.
The adjunctive use of the beta-adrenergic blocker esmolol to control the acute sympathetic responses during desflurane-based anesthesia provided a more rapid awakening from anesthesia, reduced the postoperative opioid analgesic requirement, and decreased the time to discharge home after ambulatory laparoscopic surgery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14633533/

The re-inflation and rapid blood transfusion improved haemodyanamics and BIS and SR. At second marked BIS reduction with SR elevation, a heavy cervical swelling due to a massive subcutaneous haematoma around the previously mis-punctured right carotid artery extending throughout the whole neck was observed without hypotension.

Narcotrend value; BIS; relative power (percent) in delta, theta, alpha, and beta; median frequency; spectral edge frequency; and hemodynamic parameters were recorded simultaneously. The ability of the classic and processed electroencephalographic and hemodynamic parameters to predict the clinically relevant anesthetic states of awake, steady state anesthesia, first reaction, and extubation was tested using prediction probability.
Only the Narcotrend was able to differentiate between awake versus steady state anesthesia and steady state anesthesia versus first reaction/extubation with a prediction probability value of more than 0.90.
Modern electroencephalographic parameters, especially Narcotrend, are more reliable indicators for the clinical assessment of anesthetic states than classic parameters.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14576542/

We determined the BIS and suppression ratio (SR) values during traditional burst monitoring of the raw EEG during pentobarbital infusions.
Prospective, observational cohort study.
A 42-bed multidisciplinary ICU in a tertiary care medical center.
Twelve consecutive patients with elevated intracranial pressure treated with pentobarbital infusions.
All patients were monitored continuously with the Aspect Medical Systems A-1050 bedside EEG monitor using a bilateral referential montage. Pentobarbital doses were titrated based on the raw EEG to attain a burst-suppression pattern with a goal of 3-5 bursts/minute. Drug dosage, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure values, EEG bursts/minute, BIS version 3.2, and SR were recorded daily.
The 12 patients were monitored for 62 patient-days. Mean +/- SD age was 32 +/- 15 years, seven (58%) patients were male, mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Heath Evaluation II score was 17.0 +/- 5.0, and hospital mortality was 42%. The mean pentobarbital infusion rate was 124 +/- 49 mg/hour or 2.3 +/- 1.3 mg/kg/hour, and mean pentobarbital serum concentration was 29.7 +/- 13 microg/ml. The mean BIS value was 18 +/- 14, mean SR 56% +/- 36%; BIS correlated well with SR (r=-0.99, p<0.001). For patient-days with a burst-suppression pattern, BIS 3.2 (r=0.90, p<0.001) and SR (r=-0.89, p<0.001) strongly correlated with the number of bursts/minute. The mean BIS value corresponding to 3-5 bursts/minute was 15 (95% confidence interval [CI] 10-20); SR value was 71 (95% CI 61-80).
The Aspect A-1050 applied to patients and monitored by nurses and physicians works well as a bedside EEG monitor, providing a raw EEG signal to titrate barbiturate therapy. The continuous data trend and real-time digital output for the BIS and SR quantify the degree of EEG suppression well and may prove helpful in facilitating titration of barbiturate infusions.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14524640/

Adult patients having panendoscopy, microlaryngoscopy, or tonsillectomy were randomly assigned to receive either propofol-pronounced (propofol 100 microg x kg(-1) min(-1); remifentanil 0.15 microg x kg(-1) min(-1)) or remifentanil-pronounced (propofol 50 microg x kg(-1) min(-1); remifentanil 0.45 microg x kg(-1) min(-1)) anaesthesia. In both groups, the procedure was started with remifentanil 0.4 microg x kg(-1), propofol 2 mg x kg(-1), and mivacurium 0.2 mg x kg(-1). Cardiovascular measurements and EEG bispectral index (BIS) were recorded. To maintain comparable anaesthetic depth, additional propofol (0.5 mg x kg(-1)) was given if BIS values were greater than 55 and remifentanil (0.4 microg x kg(-1)) if heart rate or arterial pressure was greater than 110% of pre-anaesthetic values.
Patient and surgical characteristics, cardiovascular measurements, and BIS values were similar in both groups. There were no differences in recovery times between the groups (time to extubation: 12.7 (4.5) vs 12.0 (3.6) min, readiness for transfer to the recovery ward: 14.4 (4.4) vs. 13.7 (3.6) min, mean (SD)).
In patients having short painful surgery, less propofol does not give faster recovery as long as the same anaesthetic level (as indicated by BIS and clinical signs) is maintained by more remifentanil. However, recovery times were less variable following remifentanil-pronounced anaesthesia suggesting a more predictable recovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14504162/

Currently the EEG bispectral index (BIS) is used as a monitor of depth of anesthesia and it has showed decreasing trend during cerebral ischemia. We conducted this study to document the changes of the BIS variable during CEA under anesthesia.
Ten patients who underwent CEA under general anesthesia were studied. The EEG BIS was measured during the perioperative period where five phases were identified: (A) before induction of anesthesia, (B) before clamping of ICA, (C) during clamping of ICA, (D) after declamping of ICA and (E) during the recovery from anesthesia.

The authors hypothesized that there is no difference in the depth of sedation and the rate of respiratory depression (RD) between propofol and methohexital in PS during the reduction of fractures and dislocations in the ED.
This was a randomized prospective study of nonintoxicated adult patients undergoing PS for fracture or dislocation reduction in the ED between July 2001 and March 2002. Patients were randomized to receive either propofol or methohexital, 1 mg/kg intravenously, followed by repeat boluses of 0.5 mg/kg every 2 minutes until adequate sedation was achieved. Doses, vital signs, end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)) by nasal cannulae, pulse oximetry, and bispectral electroencephalogram analysis (BIS) scores were recorded. RD was defined as an ETCO(2) greater than 50 torr, an oxygen saturation less than 90% at any time, or an absent ETCO(2) waveform. After returning to baseline mental status, patients completed three 100-mm visual analog scales (VASs) regarding pain associated with the procedure, recall of the procedure, and satisfaction. RD rates and VAS outcomes were compared with chi-square tests.
There were 109 patients enrolled; six were excluded for study protocol violations. Of the remaining 103 patients, 52 received methohexital (reduction successful in 94%) and 51 received propofol (98% successful). No cardiac rhythm abnormalities or significant decline in systolic blood pressure (>20%) was detected. Six patients required bag-valve-mask-assisted ventilations during the procedure, all for less than 1 minute; four of these patients received methohexital, and two received propofol. By the authors' definition, RD was seen in 25 of 52 (48%) patients receiving methohexital and 25 of 51 (49%) patients receiving propofol (p = 0.88). The mean minimum recorded BIS score was 66.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 62 to 70) for methohexital and 66 (95% CI = 60 to 71) for propofol. VAS results showed similar rates of reported pain, recall, and satisfaction for the two agents.

This study compares bispectral index-guided anaesthesia with remifentanil and either propofol or isoflurane.
Eighty consenting patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Following induction with propofol and remifentanil, anaesthesia was maintained with remifentanil/propofol or remifentanil/isoflurane. Remifentanil infusion rates were guided by haemodynamic responses--maintaining mean arterial pressure and heart rate within 20% of baseline. Propofol and isoflurane administration was guided using the bispectral index (45-60). Thirty minutes before the end of surgery, morphine was administered (0.15 mg kg(-1) intravenously). Fifteen minutes before end of surgery, propofol and isoflurane were reduced (bispectral index 60-75). At the end of surgery, the anaesthetic agents were discontinued. Groups were compared for recovery, remifentanil doses and signs of inadequate anaesthesia using the chi2-test and ANOVA (P < 0.05).
The duration of surgery was longer in the propofol/remifentanil group (121 +/- 53 versus 94 +/- 40 min). Recovery data were not different between groups. The remifentanil infusion rate was significantly lower with additional isoflurane (0.18 +/- 0.06 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) than with additional propofol (0.31 +/- 0.20 microg kg(-1) min(-1)).

A tourniquet was placed on a lower limb to record purposeful movements and myoclonia. Tracheal intubation was facilitated using rocuronium 0.6 mg kg(-1) when the BIS value was 50. The times to disappearance of the eyelash reflex, to a decrease in the BIS to 50, and to tracheal intubation were compared. The BIS values 30 s following tracheal intubation, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) at all time points were also recorded.
The BIS value decreased to 50 for tracheal intubation with no purposeful movement in all but one patient in the 0.2 mg kg(-1) group.

We measured the ability of PSI and BIS to distinguish consciousness from unconsciousness during induction and emergence from anaesthesia and a period of awareness in surgical patients.
Forty unpremedicated patients were randomized to receive: (1) sevoflurane/remifentanil (< or =0.1 microg kg(-1) min(-1)), (2) sevoflurane/remifentanil (> or = 0.2 microg kg(-1) min(-1)), (3) propofol/remifentanil (< or =0.1 microg kg(-1) min(-1)), (4) propofol/remifentanil (> or = 0.2 microg kg(-1) min(-1)). Every 30 s after the start of the remifentanil, patients were asked to squeeze the investigator's hand. Sevoflurane or propofol were given until loss of consciousness (LOC1). Tunstall's isolated forearm technique was used during neuromuscular block with succinylcholine. After tracheal intubation, propofol or sevoflurane were stopped until return of consciousness (ROC1). Propofol or sevoflurane were re-started to induce LOC2. After surgery, drugs were discontinued and recovery (ROC2) was observed. PSI and BIS at LOC (LOC1 and LOC2) were compared with those at ROC (ROC1 and ROC2) (t-test). Prediction probability (P(k)) was calculated from values at the last command before and at LOC and ROC. Values are mean (SD).
At non-responsiveness, BIS (66 (17)) and PSI (55 (23)) were significantly less than at responsiveness (BIS, 79 (14); PSI, 77 (18); P<0.05).

Therefore, we used prediction probability (PK) to evaluate the performance of the bispectral index (BIS) of the EEG and automated responsiveness test (ART) to predict sedation depth and loss of subject's responsiveness during propofol sedation, with and without N2O.
Twenty volunteers were studied during propofol administration with (N2O) and without (Air) N2O. The protocol consisted of sequential 15-min cycles. After a control period, propofol was infused to a target effect-site concentration of 0.25 microg/ml (N2O) or 1.5 microg/ml (Air), which was subsequently increased by 0.25 or 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, until loss of responsiveness was detected by loss of response to command [observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score <or= 2].
Deeply sedated patients did not respond to ART indicating that the sensitivity was 1.0 with or without N2O. The specificity of ART was 0.24 with Air and 0.98 with N2O. The BIS was better than ART in predicting OAA/S score (PK = 0.84 vs. 0.77) and loss of responsiveness (PK = 0.87 vs. 0.69) during the Air trial. Nitrous oxide decreased the performance of BIS in predicting OAA/S score (PK = 0.76), but increased the performance of ART to predict loss of responsiveness (PK = 0.85).

The induction dose was administered over 2 minutes. Patients were manually ventilated with O2 via face mask. Five minutes after induction was complete, patients were clinically assessed using the Responsiveness portion of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale (OAAS). Haemodynamic data were recorded and arterial blood samples obtained at the time of OAAS observation. Patients were administered a neuromuscular blocking agent only after the OAAS assessment. BIS (3.4) was recorded from an A-2000 EEG monitor (Aspect Medical Systems) using disposable sensors (BIS Sensor, Aspect Medical Systems) applied per manufacturer's instructions. Data were recorded on a PC for off-line analysis.
At the time of OAAS observation, mean (95% CI) BIS in group F was 85 (77-92) compared to 67 (56-79) in group EF (p = 0.01). Similarly, mean (95% CI) EMG was 50 dB (45-56) in F and 41 dB (35-47) in EF (p = 0.01). Correlation between BIS and EMG was very high (r2 = 0.88). OAAS scores were significantly higher in group F (p = 0.03). Non significant correlation was observed between BIS and OAAS scores (r2 = 0.32, p = 0.1). Backward stepwise multiple regression analysis including EMG, pH, CO2, O2 and OASS scores showed EMG as strong predictor of BIS (p < 0.0001, r2 = 0.7). Regression of EMG against BIS yielded the equation: BIS = 3.7 + (1.6 x EMG).
During fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity BIS recordings reflect EMG variations. When assessing BIS in the absence of neuromuscular blockade, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of EMG on BIS before making conclusions about depth of sedation. Fentanyl-induced rigidity appears to be a dose-related phenomenon which the EMG variable of BIS 3.4 is able to quantify.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12885182/

The peripheral nervous system is vulnerable in the setting of neuro-muscular blockade (NMB), related drug-drug interactions, and drug-clinical state interactions. Optimal assessment of the nervous system is done by means of the clinical neurological examination. In this manner, orientation, arousal, and responsiveness to stimulation provide feedback on focal and global stability of the central nervous system. Where clinical evaluation is compromised, such as with deep sedation and NMB, risk of undetected seizure activity, and/or progression of neurological injury increases dramatically. A patient receiving NMB risks breakthrough awareness and pain. Long-term complications of NMB including prolonged weakness or paralysis as well as post-traumatic stress dramatically increase morbidity and length of stay. Technologies such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and bispectral index (BIS trade mark ) monitoring are effective for assessing cerebral function as well as level of sedation or arousal, respectively, in patients with a compromised neurological assessment. Neuromuscular transmission (NMT) monitoring by means of peripheral nerve stimulation and assessment of the evoked response may be utilized, within the context of clinical assessment, to determine level of chemical paralysis and minimize dosing of NMB agents. This article explores utilization and differentiates technologies such as EEG, BIS, and NMT monitoring.

We investigated 30 patients before spine surgery. AAI; bispectral index (BIS); relative (%) delta, theta, alpha, and beta; spectral edge frequency; median frequency; mean arterial blood pressure; heart rate; and oxygen saturation were obtained simultaneously during stepwise (1.0 micro g/mL) induction of target-controlled propofol concentration until 5.0 micro g/mL, followed by an infusion of 0.3 micro g. kg(-1). min(-1) of remifentanil.

12798985,Personality trait of behavioral inhibition is associated with oscillatory systems reciprocal relationships.,International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology,2003,"Knyazev GG, Slobodskaya HR","The main aim of this paper is to offer a speculative evolutionary based interpretation of brain oscillations. We suppose that delta, theta and alpha oscillations are informational channels of three hierarchical philogenetic systems. Delta oscillations are linked with the most ancient system, which was dominant in reptilian brain. Theta oscillations dominate in lower mammals. Alpha oscillations are manifestation of activity of the newest system, which dominate in adult humans. The three hierarchical phylogenetic systems fulfill parallel processing and their contribution to resulting behavior could differ in different individuals. Relative contribution of each system is regulated by means of descending inhibition (DI), higher systems inhibiting the lower. One of this theory's implications is that the personality trait of behavioral inhibition (behavioral inhibition system, BIS) should be associated with a stronger DI but particular mechanism could be different in children and adults. In order to test this hypothesis in 95 children (11-16 years) and 45 adults (18-37 years) resting EEG recordings were obtained along with BIS scores assessed by the Gray-Wilson Personality Questionnaire. Within subject strength of DI was measured by negative correlations between delta, theta and alpha powers estimated in individually adjusted EEG bands. In adults, BIS was associated with enhanced negative feedback from the alpha to the delta system, indicating a predominantly cortical origin of the adult humans' anxiety. In children, BIS was associated with enhanced negative relation between theta and delta systems, which is similar to the mechanism known in animals where limbic system plays the crucial role in mediating anxiety and fear. Although the presented empirical data partly supported the theory, it remains to be speculative and needs further empirical validation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12798985/

This was a prospective observational study conducted in an urban county hospital of adult patients undergoing PS using propofol, methohexital, etomidate, and the combination of fentanyl and midazolam. Consenting patients were monitored by vital signs, pulse oximetry, nasal-sample end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)), and BIS monitors during PS. Respiratory depression (RD) was defined as an oxygen saturation <90%, a change from baseline ETCO(2) of >10 mm Hg, or an absent ETCO(2) waveform at any time during the procedure. After the procedure, patients were asked to complete three 100-mm visual analog scales (VASs) concerning their perception of pain, recall of the procedure, and satisfaction with the procedure. Patients were divided into four groups based on the lowest BIS score recorded during the procedure, group 1, >85; group 2, 70-85; group 3, 60-69; group 4, <60. Rates of RD and VAS outcomes were compared between groups using chi-square statistics.
One hundred eight patients were enrolled in the study. No serious adverse events were noted. RD was seen in three of 14 (21.4%) of the patients in group 1, seven of 34 (20.6%) in group 2, 16 of 26 (61.5%) in group 3, and 18 of 34 (52.9%) in group 4. The rate of RD in patients in group 2 was not significantly different from that in group 1 (p = 0.46). The rate of RD in group 2 was significantly lower than that in groups 3 (p = 0.0003) and 4 (p = 0.006). For the VAS data, when group 1 was compared with the combined groups 2, 3, and 4, it had significantly higher rates of pain (p = 0.003) and recall (p = 0.001), and a dissatisfaction rate (p = 0.085) that approached significance. When groups 2, 3, and 4 were compared with chi-square test, there was not a significant difference in pain (p = 0.151), recall (p = 0.27), or satisfaction (p = 0.25).

There was excellent correlation of the bispectral index monitor to the suppression ratio. The burst rate also correlated well to the bispectral index number and to the suppression ratio.

12760987,Can the bispectral index be used to predict seizure time and awakening after electroconvulsive therapy?,Anesthesia and analgesia,2003,"White PF, Rawal S, Recart A, Thornton L, Litle M, Stool L","The electroencephalogram (EEG) bispectral index (BIS) measures the hypnotic component of the anesthetic state and correlates with emergence from general anesthesia. Therefore, we hypothesized that the BIS would be useful in predicting electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-induced seizure times and awakening from methohexital anesthesia. Twenty-five consenting patients with major depressive disorders underwent 100 maintenance ECT treatments. All patients were premedicated with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV, and anesthesia was induced with methohexital 1 mg/kg IV. The BIS was monitored continuously, and the values were recorded at specific end-points, including before anesthesia (baseline), after the induction of anesthesia (pre-ECT), at the end of ECT (peak), after ECT (suppression), and on awakening (eye opening). The pre-ECT BIS value correlated with the duration of both the motor (r = 0.3) and EEG (r = 0.4) seizure activity (P < 0.05). The peak post-ECT BIS value correlated with the duration of the EEG seizure activity (r = 0.5) (P < 0.05). A positive correlation was also found between the EEG seizure duration and the time to eye opening (r = 0.4) (P < 0.05). However, the BIS values on awakening from methohexital anesthesia varied from 29 to 97 and were <60 in 75% of the cases. We conclude that the BIS value before the ECT stimulus is applied could be useful in predicting the seizure time. However, the BIS values on awakening were highly variable, suggesting that it reflects both the residual depressant effects of methohexital and post-ictal depression.
The bispectral index (BIS) value immediately before the electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) stimulus correlates with the duration of the motor and electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure activity during methohexital anesthesia. In addition, the increase in the BIS value during the ECT-induced seizure was proportional to the duration of EEG seizure activity. However, the BIS value on awakening from anesthesia varied widely, from 29 to 97.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12760987/

Prospective, open-label study.
Operating room of a university hospital.
28 patients, aging 20 to 50 years, scheduled for elective, 1- to 4-hour surgeries under general anesthesia.
BIS was continuously monitored from bifrontal montage (At1-Fpz and At2-Fpz) using an Aspect A-1,050 EEG system (Aspect, Natick, MA). Anesthesia was induced with bolus injections of fentanyl 2 microg/kg and propofol 2 mg/kg, and maintained with intermittent injections of fentanyl and constant infusion of propofol. Propofol infusion was stopped at the end of surgery.
Consciousness and orientation were assessed as clinical endpoints once every 2 minutes following the end of the surgery. Blood samples were extracted for plasma propofol and fentanyl concentrations (PCp and FCp, respectively), and BIS values were recorded when patients regained consciousness and orientation. Patients were allocated to one of three groups depending on FCp on awakening: Group 1, FCp > 1 microg/L (n = 8); Group 2, FCp < 1 microg/L and >0.45 microg/L (n = 9); and Group 3, FCp < 0.45 microg/L (n = 11). PCp, BIS, recovery time, and other data were compared between the three groups.
Demographic values, duration of surgery, and consumption of propofol and fentanyl were not different between the three groups. Group 3 patients regained consciousness with significantly higher propofol concentration (mean PCp = 3.2 mg/L) compared with those in Groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.05). However, the BIS values at both recovery endpoints were not different among the three groups.
The plasma levels of fentanyl affect the concentrations of propofol required for patients to regain consciousness. The BIS values for wakefulness are unaltered at the different combinations of propofol and fentanyl concentrations. Thus, the BIS appears to be a useful and consistent indicator for level of consciousness during emergence from propofol/fentanyl intravenous anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12719048/

Patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia may show an increase in slow wave and a decrease in fast wave activity of the electroencephalogram (EEG). BIS is presumed to decrease with EEG slowing. We hypothesized that the baseline ""awake"" BIS is lower in dementia than in normal elderly patients. We studied 36 patients with Alzheimer's disease or multiinfarct dementia and 36 control patients aged >75 yr. Both groups were assessed with a Mini-Mental State Test. BIS (version 3.4) was recorded from a frontal derivation using an Aspect A-2000 EEG monitor. Off-line data analysis was also performed with the newer version 4.0 of the BIS algorithm. Fourteen of 36 (38%) dementia patients and 4 of 36 (11%) controls had mean baseline BIS 3.4 <93 (P = 0.006). Eighteen of 36 (50%) dementia patients and 8 of 36 (22%) controls had mean BIS 4.0 <93 (P = 0.026). Mean (95% confidence interval) BIS 3.4 was 92.9 (91-95) in the dementia and 96.1 (95-97) in the control group (P = 0.02). Values with BIS 4.0 were, respectively, 89.1 (86-92) and 94.7 (93-96) (P = 0.002). No significant difference was found in age, sex, activity from the electromyogram, and signal quality index. As expected, the difference in Mini-Mental State Test scores was significant (P < 0.0001). A significant proportion of patients with dementia shows a low baseline BIS. The utility of the BIS monitor in detecting dementia warrants further investigation.

Depth of anesthesia may influence the neuro-hormonal release, including catecholamines. Opioids depress general sympathetic activation in a dose-dependent manner. We investigated the hypothesis that remifentanil would depress the catecholamine response to pneumoperitoneum and laparoscopic surgery differently with a high dose (HD) compared with a low dose (LD).
In a randomized, prospective study we investigated 18 ASA I-II patients undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication with an intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mmHg. The patients were randomized to receive either a LD (0.13 microg kg-1x min-1) or HD (0.39 microg kg-1 x min-1) of remifentanil with a target-controlled infusion (TCI) technique. Bispectral index of EEG (BIS) was maintained at 40-55 by propofol delivered by a TCI system. Arterial catecholamines were analyzed at different times during the procedure.
Norepinephrine increased equally in both groups during pneumoperitoneum and surgical intervention. Epinephrine stayed low in the HD-group, while increasing during surgery in the LD-group.
High dose of remifentanil depressed the epinephrine response to pneumoperitoneum and surgery, indicating no general activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Neither a LD nor HD of remifentanil depressed the norepinephrine response during pneumoperitoneum.

However, the usefulness of a parameter derived from the electroencephalogram for clinical anesthesia largely depends on its ability to predict the response to stimuli of different intensity or painfulness under a combination of a hypnotic and an (opioid) analgesic. This study was designed to evaluate the predictive performance of spectral edge frequency 95 (SEF95), BIS, and approximate entropy for the response to increasingly intense stimuli under different concentrations of both propofol and remifentanil in the therapeutic range.
Ten healthy male and ten healthy female volunteers were studied during coadministration of propofol and remifentanil. After having maintained a specific target concentration for 10 min, the depth of sedation-anesthesia was assessed using the responsiveness component of the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) rating scale, which was modified by adding insertion of a laryngeal mask and laryngoscopy. The electroencephalogram derived parameters approximate entropy, bispectral index, and SEF95 were recorded just before sedation level was assessed.
The prediction probability values for approximate entropy were slightly, but not significantly, better than those for bispectral index, SEF95, and the combination of drug concentrations. A much lower prediction ability was observed for tolerance of airway manipulation than for hypnotic endpoints.

We examined the correlation between 1) the clinically assessed state of consciousness, 2) implicit and explicit memory (by use of word pairs), and 3) various measures of EEG and AEP-bispectral index (BIS), A-Line ARX AEP index, spectral entropy, and entropy of the singular value decomposition (SVDEN; a measure of the complexity of the EEG). We studied 21 women during a two-stage awakening (sevoflurane washout followed by remifentanil washout) after anesthesia for gynecological surgery. All were amnesic, and 19 were unresponsive to verbal command with remifentanil alone. In six patients, BIS decreased paradoxically as the remifentanil concentration decreased; this was caused by a low-amplitude EEG, which was misinterpreted by the Aspect algorithm as burst suppression. Most of the EEG/AEP variables were sensitive to the decrease in sevoflurane and the recovery of consciousness, but not to the effects of decreasing remifentanil concentrations. SVDEN was the only variable that demonstrated significant increases for both the sevoflurane and remifentanil washout phases. With the prediction probability statistic during remifentanil washout, SVDEN = 0.79, spectral entropy = 0.81, A-Line ARX AEP index = 0.63, and BIS = 0.58. Entropy measures appear to be worthy of further clinical evaluation in a larger series of patients. SVDEN may be a useful variable for assessing anesthetic and analgesic effects on the central nervous system.
During the recovery phase from a remifentanil-based anesthetic, the bispectral index is not reliably predictive of the depth of consciousness, because of suppression ratio artifacts.

The exact algorithm used to synthetize the information to the BIS value is unpublished and still unknown. This study provides insight into the integration of the suppression ratio into the BIS algorithm.
EEG data of 10 healthy volunteers during propofol infusion were analyzed. Propofol concentrations were ramped up to 4 predetermined concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, or 12 microg/ml) using a computer controlled infusion pump (STANPUMP). EEG recordings were performed with an Aspect A-1000 EEG monitor (Version 3.22). The relationship of the processed EEG variables bispectral index and suppression ratio, calculated by the Aspect A-1000 monitor, was analyzed.
Up to 40% suppression ratio the average BIS values remained constant regardless of suppression ratios (r = 0.13). Beyond a suppression ratio of 40%, BIS and suppression ratio were invariably linearly correlated (r = -1). At a suppression ratio > or = 40% the BIS value could be calculated as BIS = 50 - suppression ratio/2.

Twenty patients, diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), were involved in the study. For an optimal adaptation to respiratory prothesis, they were sedated (with Propofol by continuous infusion at an initial dose of 2 mg/kg/h, which could be modulated with steps of 0.5 mg/kg/h), in order to maintain a Ramsay score of 4-5. BIS value was continuously recorded, and manually calculated on a mean average of a minute during the measuring of Ramsay score (T0) and every 30' for 24 hours on par with Ramsay score. EEG, SpO2, non invasive arterial pressure, ventilatory module, ETCO2, FIO2 were also recorded. For the statistic analysis, Friedman test and Spearman coefficient were utilized. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.
980 observations were carried out. The variation range of Ramsay Score was between 2 and 6. BIS range varied from 34 to 98.

This study measured the brain uptake of propofol in humans and the simultaneous effects on electroencephalography, cerebral blood flow velocity (V(mca)), and cerebral oxygen extraction.
Seven subjects had arterial and jugular bulb catheters placed before induction. Electroencephalography and V(mca) were recorded during induction with propofol while blood samples were taken from both catheters for later propofol analysis. Brain uptake of propofol was calculated using mass balance principles, with effect compartment modeling used to quantitate the rate of uptake.
Bispectral index (electroencephalogram) values decreased to a minimum value of approximately 4 at around 7 min from the onset of propofol administration and then slowly recovered. This was accompanied by decreases in V(mca), reaching a minimum value of approximately 40% of baseline. Cerebral oxygen extraction did not change, suggesting parallel changes in cerebral metabolism. There was slow equilibrium of propofol between the blood and the brain (t(1/2keo) of 6.5 min), with a close relation between brain concentrations and bispectral index, although with considerable interpatient variability. The majority of the decreases in V(mca), and presumably cerebral metabolism, corresponded with bispectral index values reaching 40-50 and the onset of burst suppression.
Description of brain distribution of propofol will allow development of physiologic pharmacokinetic models for propofol and evaluation of dose regimens that target the brain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12459660/

We studied the effect of esmolol on the bispectral index scale (BIS), which is a processed EEG recently introduced to monitor depth of anaesthesia.
We gave esmolol 80 mg to 30 healthy male patients after induction of anaesthesia using propofol, with either fentanyl (group 1) or placebo (group 2). Patients were ventilated mechanically through a laryngeal mask airway and anaesthesia was maintained using propofol to keep the BIS value between 55 and 60.
Esmolol did not affect the BIS index value in either group. In group 1, the areas (mean (SD)) under the BIS vs time curve 3 min before and 3 min after esmolol administration were 145 (9) and 146 (8) respectively (P = 0.116). In group 2 values were 147 (8) and 146 (7) respectively (P = 0.344). In contrast, in group 1 the area under the systolic arterial pressure (SAP) curve was 299 (31) before and 270 (29) after esmolol (P < 0.001), and 156 (17) and 141 (17) respectively for heart rate (P < 0.001).

Fifty patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy received combined epidural and general anesthesia or general anesthesia alone with isoflurane and alfentanil. Isoflurane was administered by computer-controlled closed-loop feedback to maintain an EEG 95% spectral edge frequency of 17.5 Hz, a target chosen on the basis of a pilot study. In epidural patients, end-tidal isoflurane concentration (FE'(ISO)) was 0.19% smaller (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.32% to -0.06%; P < 0.01), mean arterial blood pressure was 17 mm Hg lower (95% CI, -24 to -9 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), and body temperature was 0.4 degrees C lower (95% CI, -0.7 to 0 degrees C; P < 0.05) than in controls. EEG bispectral index (BIS) was 4 points higher (95% CI, 1 to 7; P < 0.05). EEG median frequency and heart rate were similar in both groups. Epidural patients were 76% more likely (95% CI, 58% to 94%; P < 0.001) to require metaraminol for hypotension and were 28% more likely (95% CI, 3% to 53%; P < 0.05) to require glycopyrrolate for bradycardia. After surgery, the time to eye opening in epidural patients was 2.3 min shorter (95% CI, -4.2 to -0.5 min; P < 0.05). Time to eye opening correlated better with FE'(ISO) in the last 30 s of anesthesia (FE'(ISO) = 0.07 x time to eye opening + 0.31; r(2) = 0.59; P < 0.0001) than with BIS from the same period (BIS = 64 - 1.25 x time to eye opening; r(2) = 0.22; P < 0.001) (P < 0.0001). To maintain similar intraoperative spectral edge frequency, patients receiving combined epidural and general anesthesia require 21% less isoflurane than those receiving general anesthesia alone. This smaller isoflurane dose is associated with faster emergence from anesthesia.
The dose of general anesthetic required to maintain similar intraoperative suppression of brain electrical activity is 21% less in patients with nerve blockade than in those without. This dose reduction results in faster waking times in patients with nerve blockade, which may reflect lighter intraoperative anesthesia.

Twenty-five patients were included in the study after the end of elective spine surgery without any surgical stimulation. Baseline values were defined with remifentanil 0.3 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) and target-controlled infusion of propofol 3.0 microg/mL. EEG changes were evaluated 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 min after the stop of remifentanil infusion, followed by a step-by-step reduction (0.2 microg/mL) every 3 min of target-controlled infusion propofol. Narcotrend (NT; classifying EEG stages from awake to deep anesthesia), bispectral index (BIS), EEG spectral frequency bands (%), 50% (Median) and 95% percentiles (spectral edge frequency), mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were detected at every time point. The end of remifentanil application resulted in significant increases in %alpha, spectral edge frequency, mean arterial blood pressure, and %theta and decreases in %delta (P < 0.05). NT, BIS, Median, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were unchanged. Decreases in propofol concentration were associated with statistically significant increases in NT and BIS (P < 0.05). Thus, the sedative-hypnotic component of propofol could be estimated by modern EEG variables (NT and BIS), whereas the analgesic component provided by remifentanil was not indicated. However, during conditions without surgical stimulation, neither NT nor BIS provided an adequate assessment of the depth of anesthesia when a remifentanil infusion was used.
We investigated modern and classical electroencephalographic (EEG) variables during emergence from propofol/remifentanil anesthesia.

In this study, we sought to determine the optimal concentrations of propofol and sufentanil, given by target-controlled infusions, to ensure hemodynamic stability, adequate hypnosis (assessed by electroencephalogram bispectral index), and fast recovery for a moderately painful operation. Forty-five patients, ASA physical status I or II, undergoing thyroidectomy, were randomly assigned to a sufentanil target concentration (STC) that was maintained throughout surgery (0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 ng/mL). The propofol target concentration was adjusted to keep mean arterial blood pressure within 30% of a reference value, and bispectral index between 40 and 60. Adequate anesthesia was obtained in all groups. Hypertension and clinically dangerous movements were more frequent with the small STC, and hypotension requiring treatment was more frequent with the large STC. Propofol target concentration during surgery decreased significantly with increasing STC (median at thyroid removal 5.0, 4.0, and 2.5 microg/mL, respectively) as well as the propofol consumption (740, 668, 474 mg/h). The 0.3 ng/mL STC significantly delayed the return of spontaneous breathing.
Given as a target-controlled infusion for thyroid surgery, sufentanil 0.3 ng/mL for intubation and 0.2 ng/mL during surgery, combined with propofol 4 microg/mL (corresponding to a maintenance infusion rate of approximately 7-10 mg. kg(-1). h(-1)), is recommended to ensure both optimal intraoperative stability and fast recovery.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12198044/

A third expression of memory (unconscious-controlled memory) was recently observed after moderate to light sedation (BIS, 70-80). The present study investigated memory function during deep sedation (BIS, 60-70). As memory effects are small, the authors studied potential predictors of individual differences in memory performance.
Memory function and speed of information processing were assessed in 56 outpatients before surgery. During propofol anesthesia supplemented with alfentanil, patients heard a series of words while anesthesia was titrated to BIS, 60-70. In between words, response to command was assessed using the Isolated Forearm Technique. The authors tested memory with a word stem completion task and process dissociation procedure to distinguish explicit from implicit effects.
Mean (+/- SD) BIS during word presentation was 64.0 +/- 3. Patients with conscious recall of verbal commands (n = 9) did not recall or recognize presented words. Even so, the process dissociation procedure revealed evidence of memory by a significantly higher hit rate in the inclusion condition (0.26) than in the exclusion condition (0.12). Patients without conscious recall showed no evidence of memory for presented words. Hit scores correlated significantly with scores in the preoperative memory test (r = 0.35).
The authors found evidence of weak explicit memory function during anesthesia titrated to BIS, 60-70. The observations strongly suggest that postoperative memory relates to awareness during anesthesia, but the nature of this relation remains unclear. Memory seems more likely in patients with good preoperative memory performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12151928/

In this study, the authors investigated if ictal SPECT is a reliable diagnostic test for both UIS and BIS patients.
Video-EEG recording was used as the gold standard to examine the accuracy of ictal SPECT and its relationship with interictal and ictal EEG. Ninety-three consecutive patients with MTLE associated with hippocampal sclerosis were included in the analysis. Ictal SPECT was considered accurate if two blinded observers independently lateralized the scan correctly.
Ictal SPECT correctly lateralized 75 (80.6%) of 93 scans. The rate of correct seizure lateralization was 87.6% for the UIS group and only 55.0% for the BIS group (p = 0.0027). In the EEG epochs, 66.7% of BIS patients vs 43.4% of UIS patients had nonlateralized ictal EEG (p < 0.001).

This could contribute to the antiemetic potential of subhypnotic doses of propofol. On the contrary, subhypnotic doses of propofol used for sedation could decrease GE and thus favor regurgitation and pulmonary inhalation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of low-dose propofol infusion on GE.
On three separate occasions, 10 volunteers received either a propofol infusion at a rate set to achieve a target plasma concentration of 0.5 microg/ml or equivalent volumes of 10% Intralipid(R) or 0.9% saline. GE for solids was measured by using the octanoic acid breath test. An acetaminophen absorption technique measured the GE rate for liquids. Blood samples were assayed for acetaminophen and propofol. Breath samples were analyzed for (13)CO(2) concentration by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Carbon dioxide production (VCO(2)) was measured instead of calculated by indirect calorimetry. Sedation was evaluated by the Bispectral Index of the electroencephalogram.
Propofol blood concentrations were 0.32 +/- 0.20 and 0.45 +/- 0.18 microg/ml at 60 and 165 min, respectively. These concentrations were not sedative. Propofol or its solvent did not modify GE for solids or liquids. In all groups, differences in GE were obtained if measured VCO(2) was integrated in the formula instead of calculated VCO(2) (P < 0.002).
Subhypnotic doses of propofol known to be antiemetic do not inhibit GE. These results suggest that the antiemetic properties of propofol are not peripheral and that propofol cannot be considered as a prokinetic agent. V(13)CO(2) must be measured instead of calculated to accurately determine GE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12131109/

Although such events can be life threatening, no system currently exists to detect and prevent sleep onset. Because sleep shares electroencephalographic similarities with the anesthetized state, we hypothesized that the BIS monitor, a currently available EEG-based monitor of anesthetic depth, would detect the onset of physiologic sleep. To test our hypothesis, we monitored volunteers during the transition from waking to sleep.
Non-medicated volunteers were asked to lie down in a dark room for 30-minutes and fall asleep while attached to a BIS monitor located outside the room. A laptop computer was used to generate an audio tone inside the room. Speaker volume was adjusted to the lowest level detectable by the awake subject. Testing was begun by activating a computer to play a tone at random intervals. The subject was instructed to click a mouse connected to the computer upon hearing the tone to verify wakefulness. The session was terminated upon loss of response to three consecutive tones or after 30 minutes. Subjects were questioned afterwards regarding their perceptions of sleep during testing.
11 out of 28 self-described good sleepers could not sleep under testing conditions. BIS values for the remaining 17 fell from 96.4 +/- 2.1 to 86.5 +/- 0.79 (p < 0.01) upon sleep onset. All subjects responded to audio stimuli at BIS values >90, and were asleep either by subjective or objective report at BIS values <80. Three subjects retained the mouse-click response despite low BIS scores and subjective descriptions of sleep.
Although variability in the BIS value marking sleep onset was noted, the BIS monitor detected all episodes of sleep onset in our testing regimen. We conclude that a threshold BIS value can be defined to allow the BIS monitor to detect sleep onset.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12102248/

During a TCI of propofol (n = 30) or thiopental (n = 30), clinical endpoints for loss of verbal responsiveness (LOV), loss-of-eyelash reflex (LOE), occurrence of yawning, and apnea were assessed at 15-second intervals. In addition, BIS and C(E) values were recorded at each of the endpoints.
In both anesthetic groups, the sequence of occurrence of the clinical endpoints was similar, namely LOV, LOE, yawning, and, lastly, apnea. Compared with LOV and LOE, yawning was associated with lower BIS and higher C(E) values with both anesthetics. The frequency of yawning was higher with thiopental than propofol (83% vs. 63%, respectively). However, the frequency of apnea was higher with propofol than thiopental (77% vs. 53%, respectively).
The correlation of the clinical endpoints with BIS and C(E) values was highest for LOV. Yawning was as unreliable as LOE for determining the onset of unconsciousness during induction of anesthesia.

The present study investigates the use of a neural network technique to obtain a non-proprietary index of the depth of anaesthesia from the processed EEG data.
Two hundred patients, who underwent general abdominal surgery, were recruited for our trial. For anaesthesia we used a total i.v. technique, tracheal intubation, and artificial ventilation. Fourteen EEG variables, including the BIS, were extracted from the EEG, monitored with an EEG computerized monitor, and then stored on a computer. Data from 150 patients were used to train the neural network. All the variables, excluding the BIS, were used as input data in the neural network. The output targets of the network were provided by anaesthesia scores ranging from 10 to 100 assigned by the anaesthesiologist according to the observer's assessment of alertness and sedation (OAA/S) and other clinical means of assessing depth of anaesthesia. Data from the other 50 patients were used to test the model and for statistical analysis.
The artificial neural network was successfully trained to predict an anaesthesia depth index, the NED (neural network evaluated depth), ranging from 0 to 100. The correlation coefficient between the NED and the BIS over the test set was 0.94 (P<0.0001).

Thirty-four healthy pediatric patients between three to six years of age were enrolled in this institutionally approved study. All children required dental restorations and were uncooperative. The children received a routine oral sedation regimen used in our clinic consisting of chloral hydrate, meperidine, and hydroxyzine that varied in dose for each child. Intraoperatively, nitrous oxide/oxygen was also administered. Physiological variables including oxygen saturation, blood pressure and heart rate were recorded in compliance with AAPD sedation guidelines. The behavior and levels of sedation consistent with AAPD guidelines were also recorded. The BIS monitor was used to obtain EEG information.
Useful data were recorded from 21 patients. The mean age and weight of the children were 46.1 +/- 10 months and 16.1 +/- 5 kgs, respectively. The results show a significant association between observed patient behavior and the AAPD levels of sedation (chi2 = 105.1, df = 6, P< 0.0001), between levels of sedation and behavior as a function of 12 time-oriented periods during treatment, (chi2=41.90, df=22, P<0.005 and chi2=48.0, df=33, P=0.04, respectively) and between BIS readings as a function of both level of sedation and behavior (chi2=105.1, df=6, P<0.001 and chi2=28.5, df = 18, P< 0.05, respectively).

We designed this study to examine the effect of remifentanil on BIS during combined regional/general propofol anesthesia under steady-state conditions. After Human Investigations Committee approval, 19 healthy ASA physical status I or II patients were enrolled in a prospective experimental design. Regional anesthesia was initiated and general anesthesia induced by using computer-assisted continuous infusion of propofol. Propofol was incrementally adjusted to a BIS of approximately 60. After 20 min at a stable propofol infusion rate, a remifentanil computer-assisted continuous infusion (effect-site target concentration of 0.5, 2.5, and then 10 ng/mL) was sequentially administered at stepped 15-min intervals.

BIS was recorded continuously during the hospitalization in the ICU. Where necessary, clinical brain death was confirmed by EEG or cerebral angiography.
Twelve patients were already clinically brain dead at the time of admission, and their individual BIS values were 0.

Furthermore, it is likely that such monitoring will become a standard of care, similar to other monitoring standards such as pulse oximetry and capnography. Accurate and reliable monitoring is essential, and on-going large prospective studies comparing the processed EEG or evoked potential with definable end points in both adult and pediatric populations will be necessary. The use of monitoring, such as the BIS, may improve cost efficiency by reducing the total amount of drug used to maintain anesthesia, as well as enhance recovery. A danger in this process, however, is the potential for public opinion, outside regulatory bodies, or medico-legal implications to drive change and enforce standards of care before appropriate data are available.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11892502/
11878652,Bispectral index monitoring during electroconvulsive therapy under propofol anaesthesia.,British journal of anaesthesia,2002,"Gunawardane PO, Murphy PA, Sleigh JW","The accuracy of the bispectral index (BIS) as a monitor of consciousness has not been well studied in patients who have abnormal electroencephalograms (EEG).
We studied the changes in BIS, its subparameters, and spectral entropy of the EEG during 18 electroconvulsive treatments under propofol and succinylcholine anaesthesia. A single bifrontal EEG, and second subocular channel (for eye movement estimation) was recorded.
The median (interquartile range) BIS value at re-awakening was only 57 (47-78)--thus more than a quarter of the patients woke at BIS values of less than 50. The changes in spectral entropy values were similar: 0.84 (0.68-0.99) at the start, 0.65 (0.42-0.88) at the point of loss-of-consciousness, 0.63 (0.47-0.79) during the seizures, and 0.58 (0.31-0.85) at awakening.
Post-ictal slow-wave activity in the EEG (acting via the SynchFastSlow subparameter) may cause low BIS values that do not correspond to the patient's clinical level of consciousness. This may be important in the interpretation of the BIS in other groups of patients who have increased delta-band power in their EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11878652/

However, the auditory stimuli required to generate an AEP may increase the level of consciousness, and cause an increase in the BIS. They may also alter the BIS by producing phase-locked harmonics in the surface electroencephalogram. The aim of this study was to determine if AEP stimuli have clinically significant effects on levels of consciousness and BIS values during sedation and general anaesthesia. Ten healthy adult patients were studied by measuring and recording the BIS for 6 epochs of 5 min each. The first 3 epochs took place during steady-state sedation, during which time the Observer's Assessment of Awareness/Sedation (OAA/S) score was also measured. The second 3 epochs took place during steady-state anaesthesia. During alternate epochs, patients were subjected to the auditory stimuli generated by an AEP system. The auditory stimuli were not associated with a change in BIS values (during sedation and anaesthesia) or OAA/S scores (sedation).",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11878532/
11873028,The influence of remifentanil on the dynamic relationship between sevoflurane and surrogate anesthetic effect measures derived from the EEG.,Anesthesiology,2002,"Olofsen E, Sleigh JW, Dahan A","The authors modeled the influence of remifentanil on the dynamics of sevoflurane using three parameters derived from the electroencephalogram: 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), canonical univariate parameter (CUP), and Bispectral Index (BIS).
Thirty-six patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I or II were recruited, of which 12 received a target remifentanil concentration of 0 ng/ml, eight 2 ng/ml, eight 4 ng/ml, and another eight 8 ng/ml. Next (before surgery), several step-wise changes in the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (F(ET,sevo)) were performed. A data acquisition system simultaneously recorded F(ET,sevo), the raw electroencephalogram, BIS, and SEF. The authors used a combination of an effect compartment and an inhibitory sigmoid E(MAX) model to describe the relation between F(ET,sevo) and BIS, SEF, and CUP. Model parameters (t(1/2)k(e0), E(MAX), E(MIN), C(50), gamma, CUP weight factors) were estimated using the population data analysis program NONMEM. Significant remifentanil model parameter dependencies (P < 0.01) were determined.
Determined from SEF, remifentanil had no effect on t(1/2)k(e0) (1.91 +/- 0.26 min [mean +/- standard error]) but caused an increase in C(50) (baseline = 1.48 +/- 0.12%; 80% increase at 8 ng/ml) and decrease in E(MIN) (baseline = 10.8 +/- 0.6 Hz; 80% reduction at 8 ng/ml). Determined from CUP, remifentanil caused a dose-dependent decrease in t(1/2)k(e0) (baseline = 4.31 +/- 1.00 min; 60% decrease at 8 ng/ml), with no effect on C(50) (baseline = 0.88 +/- 0.13%). Determined from BIS, remifentanil caused a dose-dependent decrease in t(1/2)k(e0) (baseline value = 3.11 +/- 0.32 min; 40% decrease at 8 ng/ml), without affecting C(50) (baseline = 1.12 +/- 0.05%). Median R(2) values of the pooled data set were 0.815 for SEF, 0.933 for CUP (P < 0.01 vs. SEF), and 0.952 for BIS (P < 0.01 vs. SEF and CUP). Addition of remifentanil increased the R(2) values for CUP only.
Remifentanil accelerates sevoflurane blood-brain equilibration without affecting its hypnotic potency as determined from BIS and CUP. In terms of R(2), the authors' pharmacodynamic model describes the anesthetic-BIS relation best.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11873028/
11867366,The correlation of the bispectral index monitor with clinical sedation scores during mechanical ventilation in the pediatric intensive care unit.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2002,"Berkenbosch JW, Fichter CR, Tobias JD","In patients who are mechanically ventilated in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), sedative and/or analgesic medications are routinely provided and titrated to effect based on clinical assessment of the patient. The bispectral index (BIS) monitor uses a modified electroencephalogram to quantify the effects of central nervous system-acting drugs on the level of consciousness. To evaluate the usefulness of the BIS monitor to predict clinical sedation levels in the PICU, we compared BIS values with simultaneously obtained clinical sedation scores in 24 mechanically ventilated pediatric patients aged 5.7 plus minus 6.1 yr. For each sedation scale used, the BIS value correlated with increasing depth of sedation (P < 0.0001) and was independent of the drug(s) used for sedation. To differentiate adequate from inadequate sedation, a BIS value <70 had a sensitivity of 0.87--0.89 and a positive predictive value of 0.68--0.84. To differentiate adequate from excessive sedation, a BIS value <50 had a sensitivity of 0.67--0.75 and a positive predictive value of 0.07--0.52. We conclude that the BIS monitor may be a useful adjunct for the assessment of sedation in PICU patients.
We demonstrate the usefulness of the bispectral index monitor for assessing sedation in pediatric intensive care unit patients. The bispectral index monitor correlated with clinically assessed sedation levels and was useful for differentiating adequate from inadequate sedation, which would be of value when the clinical examination is unavailable.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11867366/

A comparison with bispectral index monitoring during propofol-remifentanil-anaesthesia.,Der Anaesthesist,2001,"Kreuer S, Biedler A, Larsen R, Schoth S, Altmann S, Wilhelm W","The Narcotrend is a new EEG monitor designed to measure the depth of anaesthesia based on a 6-letter classification from A (awake) to F (general anaesthesia with increasing burst suppression) and divided into 14 substages (A, B0-2, C0-2, D0-2, E0,1, F0,1). This study was designed to investigate the assessment of the depth of anaesthesia as measured by the Narcotrend in comparison with bispectral index monitoring (BIS).
Both BIS and Narcotrend EEG electrodes were positioned on the patient's forehead as recommended by the manufacturers. All patients were premedicated with diazepam 0.15 mg/kg orally in the evening and on the morning before surgery. Induction of anaesthesia was started with a remifentanil infusion at 0.4 microgram/kg/min; 5 min later propofol was given for hypnosis using a target-controlled infusion initially started at 3.5 micrograms/ml. After loss of consciousness patients received 1.2 mg/kg of suxamethonium. Immediately after intubation, remifentanil was reduced to 0.2 microgram/kg/min, and the depth of anaesthesia was adjusted according to clinical needs by regulating the propofol target-controlled-infusion. BIS values and Narcotrend stages were recorded as data pairs in intervals of 1 min during anaesthetic induction and emergence, and in intervals of 5 min during maintenance of anaesthesia.
Fifty patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery were studied and 2031 data pairs were obtained. An increasing depth of anaesthesia as indicated by the Narcotrend was associated with significantly lower mean BIS values. With BIS values between 100 and 85 (representing awake patients), 95.5% of all data pairs indicated a Narcotrend stage A or B. In case the BIS was found to be 65-40 (representing general anaesthesia) the corresponding Narcotrend stages were measured as D (52.4%) or E (41.1%). No patient complained of intraoperative recall when interviewed on the 1st and 3rd postoperative day.
We could demonstrate that an increase of the hypnotic component of anaesthesia as indicated by BIS is accompanied by corresponding effects as displayed by the Narcotrend during propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia. The Narcotrend stages D or E are assumed equivalent to BIS values between 64 and 40 indicating general anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11824075/
11812701,Electrocardiographic electrodes provide the same results as expensive special sensors in the routine monitoring of anesthetic depth.,Anesthesia and analgesia,2002,"Hemmerling TM, Harvey P","The Bispectral Index (BIS) is a mathematically derived electroencephalographic (EEG) derivative that has been introduced to monitor depth of anesthesia (1,2). The A-2000 BIS monitoring system (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Newton, MA) is currently the only commercially available system to monitor depth of anesthesia. In several studies, its propensity to optimize the use of hypnotics to maintain and achieve a certain depth of anesthesia has been described (3,4). Some studies have even proposed that the routine use of the monitoring system can decrease awareness (1,5), an increasing factor in malpractice claims. The cost-benefit calculations for BIS monitoring suffer from the fact that like its predecessor, the 1000-A BIS monitor, the A-2000 BIS monitoring system demands the use of expensive, special electrodes (6). Although the application of the single-use BIS sensor is very comfortable and easy to use, its high price of approximately $10-20 US prevents many anesthesiologists from using it. Furthermore, whereas the former model of the monitor (1000-A BIS monitor; Aspect Medical Systems, Inc.) used standardized connectors, which allowed the use of other electrodes such as electrocardiogram (ECG), the new monitoring system makes this very difficult because of special connectors that match the equivalent connector at the proximal BIS sensor site. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare BIS values derived from the original BIS sensor with BIS values derived from commercially available ECG electrodes. This comparison was made possible by designing and manufacturing a connector allowing the use of ECG electrodes.
The Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor adequately monitors depth of anesthesia. The routine use of this monitor has been hampered by the benefit-cost equation because only special expensive electrodes can be used. We examined the agreement of BIS values obtained by original sensor electrodes and commercial electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes. These ECG electrodes can replace more expensive BIS sensors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11812701/

We tested whether these signals could predict physiologic sleep stages, by taking processed electroencephalogram measurements and recording full polysomnography through a night's sleep in 10 subjects being investigated for mild sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. Computerized polysomnograph signals were analyzed manually according to standard criteria, classifying each 30-s epoch as a specific sleep stage. The BIS and SEF values were taken at the end of each period of sleep when the same stage had lasted for at least 2 min. Before sleep, median values for BIS were 97 +/- 12.1 and for SEF 23 +/- 4.2 Hz. After sleep initiation, the median BIS values for arousal, light, slow wave, and rapid eye movement sleep were 67 +/- 20.2, 50 +/- 16.5, 42 +/- 11.2, and 48 +/- 7.1, respectively, and the median SEF values were 20 +/- 4.7, 15 +/- 3.6, 10 +/- 2.6, and 19 +/- 4.1 Hz, respectively. Although both BIS and SEF decreased with increasing sleep depth, the distribution of values at each sleep depth was considerable, with overlap between each sleep stage. Neither BIS nor SEF reliably indicated conventionally determined sleep stages. In addition, the response of the BIS was slow and patients could arouse with low BIS values, which then took some time to increase.
Although computer processing of the electroencephalogram can provide an adequate index of depth of anesthesia, the same processing cannot reliably convey depth of natural sleep. At each sleep stage, the output signal has a wide range of possible values.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11772814/

Studies comparing propofol TCI with manually controlled infusion (MCI) reported similar control of anaesthesia, but did not use an objective measure of anaesthetic depth. We therefore tested whether the Bispectral Index (BIS), an electroencephalographic (EEG) variable, is more stable during propofol TCI or MCI. Forty patients received midazolam and fentanyl before induction and were randomized to TCI or MCI. Target propofol concentrations in the TCI group were 3 to 8 microg/ml. The MCI group received propofol bolus (approximately 2 mg/kg) and infusion (3 to 10 mg/kg/h). Neuromuscular blockade was achieved with rocuronium. Following endotracheal intubation, nitrous oxide (66%) in oxygen was delivered and propofol infusion and fentanyl boluses were titrated against clinical signs. Blood pressure, heart rate and EEG were recorded, although the anaesthetist was blind to BIS values. The ideal BIS for general anaesthesia was defined as 50. Performance error, absolute performance error, wobble and divergence of BIS, and maximum changes in blood pressure and heart rate were compared using two-sample t-tests or rank-sum tests where appropriate. There was no difference in absolute performance errors during maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol TCI or MCI (23 +/- 11% vs 23 +/- 9%; P=0.97). The two groups did not differ significantly in performance error, wobble, divergence on haemodynamic changes. We conclude that TCI and MCI result in similar depth of anaesthesia and haemodynamic stability when titrated against traditional clinical signs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11771598/
11762264,Benzodiazepines in the intensive care unit.,Critical care clinics,2001,"Young CC, Prielipp RC","The effects of BZ drugs result from interaction at the GABAA receptor within the CNS, producing anxiolysis, hypnosis, and amnesia in a dose-dependent fashion. These sedative effects are best titrated to reproducible clinical endpoints, using scoring systems such as the Ramsay scale. All BZs exhibit similar pharmacologic effects, but the important differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics should be recognized to use these drugs safely and effectively within the ICU. Diazepam is the classic anxiolytic, amnestic, and sedative agent, but the presence of long-acting active metabolites that depend on the kidneys for elimination limits its use in many ICU patients. Lorazepam is the most potent BZ used in the ICU; it has stable pharmacokinetics and relatively low cost. This drug is best reserved for situations in which rapid onset is not essential and long-term sedation is anticipated. Midazolam has the shortest t1/2 of the commonly used BZs, generates few active metabolites, and is water soluble at physiologic pH. Thus, it is well suited for continuous infusion in the ICU, and the recent introduction of generic formulations of midazolam has decreased the drug-acquisition cost for many hospitals. Optimal sedation for ICU patients often requires BZ and concomitant therapy with drugs such as haloperidol, dexmedetomidine, opioids, and so forth, to reduce untoward side effects and, perhaps, overall drug costs. Flumazenil, a specific BZ antagonist, can be used for diagnostic or therapeutic reversal of BZ agonists when appropriate. Most experienced intensivists recommend an individualized approach to sedation and titration of anxiolysis to maximize efficacy, minimize side effects, and optimize cost effectiveness in the ICU. New CNS monitors of the EEG, such as the BIS or entropy EEG monitors, may refine titration algorithms further in the near future.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11762264/

A closed-loop anesthesia system was built using BIS as the control variable, a proportional-integral-differential control algorithm, and a propofol target-controlled infusion system as the control actuator. Closed-loop performance was assessed in 10 adult patients.
Ten adult patients scheduled to undergo elective hip or knee surgery were enrolled. An epidural cannula was inserted, and 0.5% bupivacaine was used to provide anesthesia to T8 before general anesthesia was induced using the propofol target-controlled infusion system under manual control. After the start of surgery, when anesthesia was clinically adequate, automatic control of anesthesia was commenced using the BIS as the control variable. Adequacy of anesthesia during closed-loop control was assessed clinically and by calculating the median performance error, the median absolute performance error, and the mean offset of the control variable.
The median performance error and the median absolute performance error were 2.2 and 8.0%, respectively. Mean offset of the BIS from the set point was 0.9. Cardiovascular parameters were stable during closed-loop control. Operating conditions were adequate in all patients but one, who began moving after 45 min of stable anesthesia. No patients reported awareness or recall of intraoperative events. In three patients, there was oscillation of the measured BIS around the set point.
The system was able to provide clinically adequate anesthesia in 9 of 10 patients.

After informed consent, 20 patients were randomly assigned into four groups on the basis of two target alfentanil concentrations (alfentanil 50 or 150 ng/mL) and of a saline or esmolol infusion. Bispectral index (BIS), burst suppression ratio (SR), and physiologic variables were continuously monitored. A 30-min blinded infusion of saline or esmolol was started after establishing a stable baseline and followed by a washout period. The electroencephalogram was significantly suppressed by esmolol (BIS, 37 +/- 6 to 22 +/- 6, 40% decrease [mean +/- SD]; SR, 5 +/- 7 to 67 +/- 23, 13.4-fold increase) compared with baseline in the small-dose alfentanil groups. Discontinuation of esmolol reversed the response. BIS and SR were unaffected by placebo infusion. Twelve-minute to 16-min hysteresis between esmolol administration and the onset of half-maximal cortical suppression was observed. Physiologic variables and serum propofol and alfentanil concentrations were not significantly altered by esmolol. Although the mechanism remains unclear, significant cortical depression and the onset of burst suppression during a stable, computer-controlled propofol/alfentanil anesthetic was associated with esmolol infusion.
This study demonstrated the suppression of cerebral cortical electrical activity after blinded esmolol infusion during propofol/alfentanil anesthesia. A significant lag was noted between infusion and half-maximal effect (12-16 min). Whether esmolol, a metabolite, or a secondary process was responsible for this cortical suppression remains unknown and requires further study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11726435/

After IRB approval, 70 ASA physical status I-III consenting elderly patients (> or =65 yr old) undergoing total knee or hip replacement procedures were randomly assigned to one of two general anesthetic groups. Propofol and fentanyl were administered for induction of anesthesia, followed by either desflurane 2%-4% or sevoflurane 1%-1.5% with nitrous oxide 65% in oxygen. The desflurane (2.5 +/- 0.6 MAC. h) and sevoflurane (2.7 +/- 0.5 MAC. h) concentrations were adjusted to maintain comparable depths of hypnosis using the electroencephalogram bispectral index monitor. The Mini-Mental State (MMS) test was used to assess cognitive function preoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, and 24-h intervals. The use of desflurane was associated with a more rapid emergence from anesthesia (6.3 +/- 2.4 min versus 8.0 +/- 2.8 min) and a shorter length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit (213 +/- 66 min versus 241 +/- 87 min). However, there were no significant differences between the Desflurane and the Sevoflurane groups when the MMS scores were compared preoperatively, and postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h. Compared with the preoperative (baseline) MMS scores, the values were significantly decreased at 1 h postoperatively (27.8 +/- 1.7 versus 29.5 +/- 0.5 in the Desflurane group, and 27.4 +/- 1.7 versus 29.2 +/- 1.0 in the Sevoflurane group, respectively). However, the MMS scores returned to preoperative baseline levels within 6 h after surgery. At 1 h and 3 h after surgery, 51% and 11% (versus 57% and 9%) of patients in the Desflurane (versus Sevoflurane) Group experienced cognitive impairment. In conclusion, desflurane is associated with a faster early recovery than sevoflurane after general anesthesia in elderly patients.

Prospective, observational study.
Medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university-affiliated teaching hospital.
Thirty-one awake, unsedated critically ill adults were assessed in 108 separate sessions.
In each session, severity of illness was assessed by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE III). The APACHE III Acute Physiology Score was used to quantify the degree of physiologic derangement. Neurologic function was assessed using the APACHE III Neurologic Score, the Glasgow Coma Scale, the Reaction Level Scale, and the Modified Ramsay Sedation Scale. All indices were plotted against various spectral parameters of the EEG, including BIS, an empirical index of EEG activity that is scaled from 0 to 100. BIS was significantly (p <.05) correlated with neurologic score regardless of scoring system used and was more strongly correlated than any other EEG spectral parameter. Better neurologic function was associated with higher values of BIS. In multivariate analysis, the combination of BIS and relative power in the theta band of the EEG accounted for 38% of the variability in the Glasgow Coma Scale.
BIS provides a reliable index of neurologic status in awake, unsedated, critically ill patients.

Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and sufentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane in air/oxygen adjusted to keep the bispectral index between 40 and 60. One and a half hours after the start of surgery, nitrous oxide was administered in a randomised sequence of concentrations (20, 40 and 60% end-expired). Under steady-state conditions, mean (SD) bispectral index and spectral edge frequency decreased as end-tidal concentration of nitrous oxide increased, from 47.7 (4.3) and 15.6 (1.3) at 0% nitrous oxide to 39.8 (6.3) and 14.3 (1.8) at 60% nitrous oxide. A negative correlation was found between nitrous oxide concentration and bispectral index (r = -0.48; p < 0.01) and spectral edge frequency (r = -0.39; p < 0.05).

We compared the ability of the bispectral index (BIS) to distinguish the awake and anaesthetized states during the induction of general anaesthesia with: (i) components of the BIS (BetaRatio, SynchFastSlow); (ii) a new EEG variable--the median frequency of the first time derivative of the EEG signal (SE50d); and (iii) the SE50d derived from an EEG signal that has had the frequencies above 30 Hz removed (SE50d(30Hz)). Two groups of subjects were studied: (i) nine volunteers undergoing a short propofol infusion until loss of response to verbal command, and (ii) 84 patients undergoing routine anaesthesia for a variety of surgical procedures. In the volunteer group, the changes in the BetaRatio and SE50d were comparable with changes in the BIS. The changes in the SE50d(30Hz) were less consistent. In the patient group, the BIS components were equivalent to the BIS in separating the awake from the surgically anaesthetized states (area under receiver operating curve: BIS 0.95, SE50d 0.95, BetaRatio 0.96). Using the submental electromyogram (EMG) signal to estimate the frontalis EMG (30-47 Hz) signal, the changes in EMG signal were, on average, about one-tenth the magnitude of the EEG. We conclude that: (i) there exist simpler derived EEG variables that are similar in accuracy to the BIS; (ii) it is important to avoid filtering out the EEG frequencies above 30 Hz; and (iii) in most patients the confounding effects of the frontalis EMG on the EEG are minimal.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11575410/
11575336,Clonidine decreases propofol requirements during anaesthesia: effect on bispectral index.,British journal of anaesthesia,2001,"Fehr SB, Zalunardo MP, Seifert B, Rentsch KM, Rohling RG, Pasch T, Spahn DR","Assessment of the effect of clonidine on depth of anaesthesia is difficult because clonidine combines analgesic, sedative and direct haemodynamic effects. We thus evaluated the influence of clonidine on the bispectral index (BIS) and its potential dose-sparing effect on propofol. After induction of anaesthesia with target-controlled infusion of propofol and obtaining an unchanged bispectral index (pre-BIS), clonidine 4 microg kg(-1) or placebo was administered randomly to 50 patients in a double-blind manner. Subsequently, if there was a decrease in BIS we reduced the target concentration of propofol until pre-BIS was reached. The pre-BIS was maintained and a remifentanil infusion was added during surgery. The courses of the BIS, heart rate and blood pressure were recorded and the total amounts of intra-operative propofol and remifentanil were determined. Assessment of implicit memory during anaesthesia was performed with an auditory implicit memory test consisting of item sequences. Administration of clonidine resulted in a decrease in the BIS from 45 (SD 4) to 40 (6) (P<0.001), which allowed a reduction of propofol target concentration from 3.3 (0.6) to 2.7 (0.7) microg ml(-1) (P<0.001) and measured propofol concentration from 2.9 (0.6) to 2.5 (0.7) kg ml(-1) (P=0.009) in order to maintain the pre-BIS value. During subsequent surgery, propofol requirements were reduced by 20% (P=0.002) in the clonidine group and a similar amount of remifentanil was used in each group. The increase in anaesthetic depth given by clonidine can therefore be measured with bispectral EEG analysis and allows reduction of the propofol dose to achieve a specific depth of anaesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11575336/

Fourteen patients underwent hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (32 degrees C, group H), and 14 normothermic CPB (group N). The level of sedation was measured with Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Score and with Ramsay Sedation Score. BIS was the only EEG measurement that paralleled the clinical course of the patients' sedation level. Values (median, 95% confidence intervals (CI)) changed significantly over time in both groups (P<0.0001). In group H, BIS decreased from 97 (95, 99) the day before surgery to 48 (44, 52) after tracheal intubation, to 46 (41, 52) before going off CPB, to 91 (85, 97) immediately before extubation. In group N, values were 93 (91, 97) the day before surgery, 53 (47, 59) after tracheal intubation, 48 (43, 53) before going off CPB, and 90 (84, 96) before extubation. During CPB, BIS values were significantly different between the two groups. Group H had a median of 41 (95% CI, 39, 42), and group N had a median of 49 (95% CI, 48, 51, P<0.0001). Peak values of all other processed EEG parameters during anaesthesia and surgery overlapped with values from the day before, when patients had no sedating medication, and these values did not correlate to the patients' course of sedation during the study. There was no explicit recall of the surgery in either group. During the phases of anaesthesia and surgery without CPB, the progression of BIS levels was comparable with previously published data for non-cardiac surgery. During normothermic CPB, the highest BIS values were close to values representing insufficient depth of sedation. It remains to be elucidated whether the much lower BIS values in the hypothermic group were solely a result of brain cooling or if increased serum propofol concentrations, because of slowed pharmacodynamics during hypothermia, also contributed.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11573582/

A biphasic effect, that is, an initial increase of the effect variable followed by a decrease at higher concentrations, during the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness was found in EEG amplitude (both frequency bands) and in SEF95 for all anaesthetics except midazolam. There was a concentration-related decrease in BIS for all anaesthetics. There was no consistent relationship between the time of occurrence of the peak EEG effect, or the value of the EEG variable and the moment of loss of consciousness.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the management of drugs and to measure immediate recovery after anaesthesia with or without BIS monitoring.
We studied 90 patients undergoing abdominal surgery randomly allocated to one of two groups of 45 each with or without BIS monitoring. Standard monitoring (EKG, arterial oxygen saturation and non-invasive blood pressure) was applied. All groups were monitored with BIS, using electrodes (Zipprep, Aspect Medical Systems) applied to the forehead. In the group 2 the BIS value was blinded to the anaesthesiologist. The BIS value was displayed using Spacelabs Medical BIS Ultraview Monitor. After obtaining baseline values for the BIS index (group 1) and haemodynamic data (all groups) anaesthesia was induced with a bolus dose of remifentanil and TPS, and vecuronium. The anaesthesia was maintained with Remifentanil and Sevoflurane. At standard times BIS, haemodynamic and respiratory parameters were recorded. Recovery times were measured by a study coordinator. Drug consumption was calculated.
In group 1 the consumption of Sevoflurane decreased by 40 % while the consumption of remifentanil decreased by 10 % as compared to group 2. The use of vecuronium did not change in the 2 groups. In group 1 the time elapsed from cessation of anaesthetics to orientation decreased significantly. The difference was 5 min, from 11 to 6 min.

Hypnosis is assessed by means of the bispectral index (BIS), a processed parameter derived from the electroencephalogram. Isoflurane is administered through a closed-circuit respiratory system. The model for control was identified on a population of 20 healthy volunteers. It consists of three parts: a model for the respiratory system, a pharmacokinetic model and a pharmacodynamic model to predict BIS at the effect compartment. A cascaded internal model controller is employed. The master controller compares the actual BIS and the reference value set by the anesthesiologist and provides expired isoflurane concentration references to the slave controller. The slave controller maneuvers the fresh gas anesthetic concentration entering the respiratory system. The controller is designed to adapt to different respiratory conditions. Anti-windup measures protect against performance degradation in the event of saturation of the input signal. Fault detection schemes in the controller cope with BIS and expired concentration measurement artifacts.

In this prospective, blinded study of children (n = 24) and infants (n = 25) undergoing elective circumcision, we evaluated BIS and consciousness level during emergence from anesthesia. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, and a penile nerve block was performed in each patient before surgical stimulation. At the completion of surgery, the sevoflurane was decreased stepwise from 0.9% in increments of 0.2%, and arousal was tested with a uniform auditory stimulus given after a steady state of end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was achieved at each step. The BIS increased significantly as the sevoflurane concentrations decreased in children (0.9%, 62.5 +/- 8.1; 0.7%, 70.8 +/- 7.4; and 0.5%, 74.1 +/- 7.1; P < 0.001 for 0.7% and 0.5% compared with 0.9%), but a similar relationship was not demonstrated in infants. The BIS values at 0.7% and 0.5% sevoflurane were significantly higher in children than infants (P < 0.02 and P < 0.002, respectively). In both children and infants, the BIS increased significantly from pre- to postarousal (children, 73.5 +/- 7 to 83.1 +/- 12, P = 0.01; infants, 67.8 +/- 10 to 85.6 +/- 13.6, P < 0.001).

11432160,The use of bispectral analysis to monitor outpatient sedation.,Anesthesia progress,2000,Sandler NA,"The bispectral (BIS) index has been used to interpret partial EEG recordings to predict the level of sedation and loss of consciousness in patients undergoing general anesthesia. The author has evaluated BIS technology in determining the level of sedation in patients undergoing outpatient deep sedation. These experiences are outlined in this review article. Initially, the correlation of the BIS index with traditional subjective patient evaluation using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) scale was performed in 25 subjects. In a second study, the recovery profile of 39 patients where the BIS was used to monitor sedation was compared with a control group where the monitor was not used. A strong positive relationship between the BIS and OAA/S readings was found in the initial subjects. From the recovery study, it appears that use of the BIS monitor may help titrate the level of sedation so that less drugs are used to maintain the desired level of sedation. A trend to earlier return of motor function in BIS-monitored patients was also demonstrated. BIS technology offers an objective, ordinal means of assessing the depth of sedation. This can be invaluable in comparing studies of techniques. The BIS index provides additional information to standard monitoring techniques that helps guide the administration of sedative-hypnotic agents. The trend to earlier return of motor function in BIS-monitored patients warrants further investigation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11432160/
11407290,Effects on the bispectral index during elective caesarean section: a comparison of propofol and isoflurane.,Acta anaesthesiologica Sinica,2001,"Tsai PS, Huang CJ, Hung YC, Cheng CR","Awareness during general anesthesia has been a particular problem during caesarean section. About 7 percent of patients undergoing elective caesarean section have reported dreaming or recall of voices during the procedure. The bispectral index (BIS), a value derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG), has been shown to be useful in monitoring the depth of anesthesia. Supplementation of propofol or isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia has been shown to effectively reduce the incidence of awareness. However, the effects of propofol or isoflurane on the BIS index have not been fully investigated. We therefore designed this study to compare the effects of isoflurane or propofol supplementation on the BIS index in 24 healthy parturients undergoing elective caesarean section.
All patients had induction of anesthesia and orotracheal intubation in rapid sequence made possible by 1 MAC isoflurane with 50% N2O-50% O2 as conveyer and atracurium. After delivery, patients were randomly assigned to either of two groups (isoflurane or propofol). Patients in the Isoflurane group (n = 12) received 0.5 MAC isoflurane in 67% N2O-33% O2 and fentanyl + droperidol. Patients in the propofol group (n = 12) received propofol (8 mg/kg/h) infusion combined with 67% N2O-33% O2 and fentanyl + droperidol.
There was no difference between the two groups in total operation time, maternal blood loss, fetal Apgar scores. No differences between the two groups in heart rate, blood pressure or BIS index values were found throughout the surgery. No patient from either group reported recall of the operative procedure. However, 25% of patients (3 of 12) in the isoflurane group had poor uterine contraction, suggestive of doubtful appropriateness of the use of isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia in delivery.
We therefore concluded that supplementation of isoflurane or propofol for maintenance of anesthesia can satisfactorily decrease the BIS index and minimize the incidence of awareness in patients undergoing caesarean section under general anesthesia. The BIS index is a reliable monitor of the hypnotic component of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11407290/

In this study we evaluated the BIS changes in induction of anesthesia with ketamine in comparison with that of thiamylal.
Forty ASA class I and II adult female patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgeries were enrolled into this randomized, prospective study. No premedication was given to the patient. In each patient EEG was recorded continuously from the frontal electrodes using Aspect A-1050 monitor after his arrival at the operating room. Blood pressure and heart rate were also recorded throughout the surgery. After steady baseline recordings of all necessary parameters having been accomplished Group K patients (n = 20) were given an induction dose of ketamine 1.5 mg/kg i.v., whereas Group T patients (n = 20) received thiamylal 5 mg/kg i.v. When loss of consciousness was ascertained, intubation was performed after administration of succinylcholine 1 mg/kg i.v. and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane-nitrous oxide-oxygen. Demographics, BIS values, HR, BP were analyzed and compared.
The demographics were comparable between the two groups. Both groups showed a mean value of BIS of 96 with comparable BP and HR before induction. After study drug the post-induction BIS for ketamine was 94 as against 51 for thiamylal (P < 0.05), 91 against 43 post-succinylcholine (P < 0.05), 92 against 53 post-intubation (P < 0.05) and 45 against 37 five min after isoflurane. BIS remained below 60 throughout the entire course of anesthesia and returned to above 95 on emergence in both groups. None of the patients reported awareness, recall, delirium or hallucination during anesthesia.
Ketamine-induced dissociative anesthesia produces persistently elevated BIS index which is different from thiamylal and those reported with other conventional anesthetic agents. The established range of BIS index appears not to be applicable in patients under ketamine anesthesia. Monitoring the depth of ketamine anesthesia remains to be a challenging problem.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11407289/

Transformed electroencephalogram monitors, such as the Bispectral Index monitor, have been advocated as tools to prevent unexpected recall.
The authors conducted a power analysis to estimate how many patients would be needed in an appropriately powered study to demonstrate the Bispectral Index monitor reduces awareness, as well as a cost analysis to assess the cost of using the monitor for this purpose alone.
If unexpected recall is rare (1 in 20,000), it will require a large study to demonstrate that the monitor reduces awareness (200,000-800,000 patients), and the cost of using it for this purpose alone would be high ($400,000 per case prevented). If awareness is common (1 in 100), then the number of patients needed in a study to demonstrate that the monitor works becomes tractable (1,000-4,000 patients), and the cost of using the monitor for this purpose alone becomes lower ($2,000 per case prevented). Because there are reported cases of awareness despite Bispectral Index monitoring, the authors are certain that the effectiveness of the monitor is less than 100%. As the performance of the monitor decreases from 100%, the size of the study needed to demonstrate that it works increases, as does the cost of using it to prevent awareness.
The contention that Bispectral Index monitoring reduces the risk of awareness is unproven, and the cost of using it for this indication is currently unknown.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11374615/

Electroencephalographic monitoring is one method of determining indirectly anesthetic effect on the brain. The present study investigated the effect of surgical stimuli on the concentration-response relation of desflurane-induced electroencephalographic changes.
The electroencephalographic activity was recorded from 24 female patients who received only desflurane after a single induction dose of propofol. Twelve patients served as a control group before surgical stimulation. The other 12 patients, all undergoing lower abdominal surgery, were investigated between opening and closure of the peritoneum. Desflurane vaporizer settings were randomly increased and decreased between 0.5 and 1.6 minimum alveolar concentration as long as anesthesia was considered adequate. Spectral edge frequency 95, median power frequency, and Bispectral Index were calculated. Desflurane effect-site concentrations and the concentration-effect curves for spectral edge frequency 95, median power frequency, and Bispectral Index were determined by simultaneous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling.
Surgical stimulation shifted the desflurane concentration-electroencephalographic effect curves for spectral edge frequency 95, median power frequency, and Bispectral Index toward higher desflurane concentrations. In the unstimulated group, 2.2 +/- 0.74 vol% desflurane were necessary to achieve a Bispectral Index of 50, whereas during surgery, 6.8 +/- 0.98 vol% (mean +/- SE) were required.

Electroencephalogram bispectral index (BIS) enables monitoring of the hypnotic state and titration of anesthesia to an adequate level (BIS 40 to 60). At this level, preserved memory function has been observed in trauma patients. We investigated memory formation in elective surgical outpatients during target-controlled propofol anesthesia supplemented with alfentanil. While BIS remained between 40 and 60, patients listened to a tape with either familiar instances (exemplars) from two categories (Experimental [E] group, n = 41) or bird sounds (Control [C] group, n = 41). After recovery, memory was tested directly and indirectly. BIS during audio presentation was on average (+/- SD) 44 +/- 5 and 46 +/- 5 for Groups E and C, respectively. No patient consciously recalled the intraoperative period, nor were presented words recognized reliably (Group E, 0.9 +/- 0.8 hits; Group C, 0.8 +/- 0.8 hits) (P = 0.7). When asked to generate category exemplars, Group E named 2.10 +/- 1.0 hits versus 1.98 +/- 1.0 in Group C (P = 0.9). We found no explicit or implicit memory effect of familiar words presented during adequate propofol anesthesia at BIS levels between 40 and 60 in elective surgical patients.

Anesthesia was initially maintained with desflurane 2.5% (subsequently titrated to maintain an electroencephalogram-bispectral index value of 60) and nitrous oxide 65% in oxygen. Before skin incision, an infusion of either esmolol (5 microg. kg(-1). min(-1)) or remifentanil (0.05 microg. kg(-1). min(-1)) was started and titrated to maintain the heart rate within 25% of the baseline value. Mivacurium, 0.04 mg/kg IV, bolus doses were administered to maintain a stable peak inspiratory pressure. Esmolol (12.8 +/- 13.1 microg. kg(-1). min(-1)) and remifentanil (0.04 +/- 0.02 microg. kg(-1). min(-1)) infusions were equally effective in maintaining a stable heart rate during these laparoscopic procedures. Although the mivacurium requirement was larger in the Esmolol group (7 +/- 5 vs 3 +/- 4 mg), the Esmolol group reported a smaller incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (4% vs 35%). Both drugs were associated with frequent ""postanesthesia care unit bypass"" rates (78-81%), short times to ""home readiness"" (119-120 min), excellent patient satisfaction (81-85%), and rapid resumption of normal activities (2.6-3.2 d). Fast-tracked patients were ready for discharge home significantly earlier (112 +/- 46 vs 151 +/- 50 min).

Therefore, we investigated how xenon affects the BIS. Nine and 11 patients were anaesthetized with 0.8 of the minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane (0.92%) and xenon (56%), respectively. After the end of operation, these concentrations were decreased in decrements of 0.1 MAC (isoflurane 0.12% or xenon 7%) and each new concentration was maintained for 15 min. This was repeated until the patient first opened her eyes or squeezed the investigator's hand on command. Isoflurane and xenon at 0.8 MAC reduced the BIS to a median of 40 (range 36-53) and 36 (30-61), respectively. With decreasing concentrations of isoflurane, the BIS increased progressively and it reached a median of 96 (90-98) when the patients awoke. In contrast, four patients receiving xenon responded to verbal command while the BIS was below 50 [median 45 (range 41-49)]. The remaining seven patients in the xenon group awoke when their BIS was greater than 80 [median 96 (range 82-98)], but in four of them the BIS was no greater than 50 when the xenon concentration was only 0.1 MAC (7%) higher than that associated with awakening.

In Experiment 1, propofol was infused in 11 subjects to obtain effect-site concentrations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 microg/mL. The ASSR and BIS index were recorded during baseline and at each concentration. The ASSR was evoked by monaural stimuli. Propofol caused a concentration-dependent decrease of the ASSR and BIS index values (r(2) = 0.76 and 0.93, respectively; P<0.0001). The prediction probability for loss of consciousness was 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 for ASSR, BIS, and arterial blood concentration of propofol, respectively. In Experiment 2, we compared the effects of binaural versus monaural stimulus delivery on the ASSR in six subjects during awake baseline and propofol-induced unconsciousness. During baseline, the ASSR amplitude with binaural stimulation (0.47+/-0.13 microV, mean +/- SD) was significantly (P<0.002) larger than with monaural stimulation (0.35+/-0.11 microV). During unconsciousness, the amplitude was 0.09+/-0.09 microV with monaural and 0.06+/-0.04 microV with binaural stimulation (NS). The prediction probability for loss of consciousness was 0.97 (0.04 SE) for monaural and 1.00 (0.00 SE) for binaural delivery. We conclude that the ASSR and BIS index are attenuated in a concentration-dependent manner by propofol and provide a useful measure of its sedative and hypnotic effect. BIS was easier to use and slightly more sensitive. The ASSR should be recorded with binaural stimulation. The ASSR and BIS index are both useful for assessing the level of consciousness during sedation and hypnosis with propofol. However, the BIS index was simpler to use and provided a more sensitive measure of sedation.
We have compared two methods for predicting whether the amount of propofol given to a human subject is sufficient to cause unconsciousness, defined as failure to respond to a simple verbal command. The two methods studied are the auditory steady-state response, which measures the electrical response of the brain to sound, and the bispectral index, which is a number derived from the electroencephalogram. The results showed that both methods are very good predictors of the level of consciousness; however, bispectral was easier to use.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11093988/

Open, observational trial with retrospective analysis of guideline performance. Data were analyzed from 1,552 adult patients receiving general anesthesia with surgical times of at least 1 hour and who were extubated by postanesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge. Staff were trained using a simple decision matrix, which integrated BIS titration goals with anesthetic management. Unmonitored patients were compared to either BIS-monitored patients or to performance subgroups based on BIS measurements recorded during anesthetic maintenance (""deep"", BIS < 50; ""target"", 50-65; ""light"", >65).
Large, urban academic/trauma center.
Demographic profiles of all groups and subgroups were similar. Anesthetic emergence, recovery times, and volatile drug use were significantly shortened or reduced only when BIS values were maintained between 50 and 65. Extubation time from end of surgery decreased by 2.1 minutes from 5.7+/-7 (37%); OR exit time decreased by 2.2 minutes from 9.3+/-6 (24%); eligibility for phase 1 PACU discharge decreased by 4 minutes from 22+/-42 (23%); and actual PACU discharge decreased by 15 minutes from 130+/-78 (7%). PACU extubation frequency decreased from 6.9% to 2.6%. Modest decreases in total intraoperative drug use were noted with an increase in PACU analgesic administration.
Routine application of BIS monitoring throughout an OR suite impacted clinical outcome only if guideline targets were met. BIS values within the last 30 minutes of surgery were not predictive of emergence or recovery. Hypnotic maintenance at BIS < 50 did not confer any clinical advantage over unmonitored cases.

However, it also increases the direct costs of anaesthesia due to the need for special EEG electrodes. In the present study we tested the feasibility of less expensive electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes for EEG-BIS monitoring.
In the first part of the study we compared skin-electrode impedances when EEG electrodes were used after alcohol swab pretreatment of skin to impedances when ECG electrodes were used after alcohol swab pretreatment with or without skin abrasion paste. In the second part of the study we evaluated the difference in parallel BIS values collected with two BIS monitors, using either ECG electrodes or EEG electrodes. In the third part of the study we compared parallel BIS values collected with two sets of EEG electrodes.
Skin pretreatment with abrasion paste led to lower impedances with ECG electrodes than did alcohol swab pretreatment of skin with EEG electrodes. When the skin was pretreated with alcohol swab, higher impedances were measured with ECG electrodes than with EEG electrodes. In most patients, BIS values collected with ECG electrodes were also higher than those collected with adhesive EEG electrodes. The difference between parallel BIS values collected with two sets of adhesive EEG electrodes was smaller than the difference between BIS values collected with ECG and EEG electrode sets.
Low skin-electrode impedances indicating reliable skin-electrode contact can be ensured with inexpensive pregelled ECG electrodes only if the skin is carefully prepared with both abrasion paste and alcohol. When only alcohol pretreatment of skin is used, the BIS values collected with EEG electrodes and ECG electrodes are not equal. EEG-BIS monitoring with pregelled ECG electrodes is recommended only if skin is prepared with abrasion paste before attaching the electrodes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11065209/

Bispectral index of EEG (BIS) seems promising in measuring hypnotic effect of anaesthetic drugs. The aims of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of TCI systems in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and to correlate measured drug levels to BIS values. Data were analysed for possible gender differences during emergence.
After written informed consent, 20 patients were enrolled in an open study. Remifentanil was set at 7.5 ng/ml as target throughout the whole procedure, and propofol at 5 microg/ ml at induction and 3 microg/ml after intubation. Values in blood samples of remifentanil and propofol were correlated to the estimated values and to systolic blood pressure and BIS. BIS values and measured drug levels during emergence and emergence time were compared for the two sexes.
Measured drug values varied considerably from the set target with a prediction error of -22% for remifentanil and 49% for propofol. The anaesthesia level was regarded as quite deep with a mean BIS during stable surgery of 42 +/- 7, and at this level we found no correlation between measured values of either of the two drugs and BIS. The emergence time was significantly shorter for women (12.6 +/- 2.5 min) than for men (19.0 +/- 4.2 min) (P=0.001), with no significant differences in measured levels of propofol or remifentanil or BIS during the emergence period.
Present systems for TCI of remifentanil and propofol result in large intra- and interindividual variations in measured drug levels, and measured levels differ from target. There may be possible interaction between the two anaesthetics at a pharmacokinetic level. Within the level of anaesthesia studied here, BIS was not an indicator of the actual drug levels.

Elevation of electroencephalographic (EEG) Beta/Alpha Ratio has been linked to onset of midazolam amnesia. Propofol anaesthesia for cardioversion in 19 patients enabled us to profile the changes in BIS and Beta/Alpha Ratio during a short, single-agent anaesthetic with a relatively rapid induction and recovery period. BIS values did not alter significantly through onset of amnesia and hypnosis as compared with awake values. Cardioversion occurred over a wide range of BIS values (38 to 94), with recovery at a median BIS value of 79. We observed the BIS to lag about 60 s behind the clinical situation (termed BIS60). The BIS60 more closely tracked the clinical level of consciousness, showing statistically significant differences from the uncorrected BIS. (amnesia (median BIS60 = 82, P = 0.02), hypnosis (median BIS60 = 67, P = 0.01), eye opening (median BIS60 = 90, P = 0.001)). An early EEG Beta/Alpha Ratio peak occurred at a mean of 4.6 s (SD = 16.6) after clinical amnesia onset and a late peak at a mean 58 s (SD = 144) after eye opening. There was no significant EEG response to cardioversion. We conclude that: (1) in rapidly changing conditions, the value of the BIS most accurately reflects the level of consciousness of the patient about 60 s in the past, and (2) the onset and offset of propofol-induced amnesia commonly corresponds to a peak in Beta/Alpha Ratio of the EEG.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10969364/

Fourteen patients scheduled for elective coronary bypass surgery were studied. BIS was recorded during induction in 7 patients receiving 10 microg/kg fentanyl without any hypnotic agent and in 7 patients receiving 0.5 mg/kg propofol before the fentanyl dose.

BIS values at loss of response varied between 45 and 94. One patient remained awake with BIS 43. All 7 patients receiving propofol before the fentanyl dose lost their response to verbal command within 5 min. BIS values at the time for loss of response varied between 78 and 98.
Loss of response to verbal command when a medium-high dose of fentanyl is used for induction cannot be distinguished from wakefulness with adequate sensitivity by BIS.

It was the purpose of this project to assess the usefulness of BIS technology in determining the level of sedation in patients undergoing third molar extraction under conscious sedation.
Twenty-five subjects undergoing third molar extraction in an outpatient setting were analyzed. The EEG activity was recorded continually during surgery using a microcomputer (Aspect-1050 Monitor; Aspect Co, Natick, MA) with real-time bispectral data obtained by EEG skin electrodes through a frontotemporal montage. The Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) scale was used to subjectively assess the level of sedation observed by the anesthetist before initiating the sedation procedure and then at 5-minute intervals until the end of the procedure. The BIS level was simultaneously recorded. The initial sedation was accomplished using a standard dose of midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) and fentanyl (1.5 microg/kg) followed by a 10- to 30-mg bolus of propofol until a level of sedation at which the patient's eyes were closed and he or she was responsive only to vigorous stimulation or repeated loud calling of their name (OAA/S level of 1 to 2). Local anesthesia was then administered. Additional doses of sedative medication (midazolam or propofol) were given during the procedure to maintain the desired level of sedation (an OAA/S level of 2 to 3). The time and dose of the drug given were recorded. The level of sedation based on a single anesthetist's interpretation (OAA/S) and the BIS readings were then compared.
A strong positive relationship between the BIS index and OAA/S readings was found (P < .0001). Pairwise comparisons of mean BIS index and its corresponding OAA/S level were significantly different from each other (P < .003) except for OAA/S levels 2 and 3 (P = .367).
BIS technology offers an objective, ordinal means of assessing the depth of sedation. There was a strong relationship between the objective BIS values and subjective assessment (OAA/S scale) of the depth of anesthesia. This can be invaluable in providing an objective assessment of sedation in oral and maxillofacial surgery where it may be difficult to determine the level of sedation clinically.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10759114/

In a second arm of the study, a range of steady-state end-tidal concentrations of sevoflurane was administered and corresponding BIS documented. Data were examined for differences between infants (0-2 yr) and children (2-12 yr). No difference was seen in BIS values in children before induction, during maintenance, and on emergence compared with adult values. There was no difference in BIS between infants and children at similar clinical levels of anesthesia. In children and infants, BIS was inversely proportional to the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane. The sevoflurane concentration for a BIS = 50 (95% confidence interval) was significantly different: 1. 55% (1.40-1.70) for infants versus 1.25% (1.12-1.37) for children. Although validation with specific behavioral end points was not possible, BIS correlated with clinical indicators of anesthesia in children as it did in adults: as depth of anesthesia increased, BIS diminished. BIS correlated with sevoflurane concentration in infants and children. The concentration-response difference between infants and children was consistent with data showing that minimum alveolar concentration is higher in children less than 1 yr of age.
The use of bispectral index (BIS) during general anesthesia improves the titration of anesthetics in adults. The data from this study suggest that the same equipment and method of electroencephalogram analysis may be applied to infants and children.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10735791/
10719951,Approximate entropy as an electroencephalographic measure of anesthetic drug effect during desflurane anesthesia.,Anesthesiology,2000,"Bruhn J, Röpcke H, Hoeft A","The authors hypothesized that the electroencephalogram (EEG) during higher anesthetic concentrations would show more ""order"" and less ""randomness"" than at lower anesthetic concentrations. ""Approximate entropy"" is a new statistical parameter derived from the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy formula which quantifies the amount of regularity in data. The approximate entropy quantifies the predictability of subsequent amplitude values of the EEG based on the knowledge of the previous amplitude values. The authors investigated the dose-response relation of the EEG approximate entropy during desflurane anesthesia in comparison with spectral edge frequency 95, median frequency, and bispectral index.
Twelve female patients were studied during gynecologic laparotomies. Between opening and closure of the peritoneum, end-tidal desflurane concentrations were varied between 0.5 and 1.6 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). The EEG approximate entropy, median EEG frequency, spectral edge frequency 95, and bispectral index were determined and the performance of each to predict the desflurane effect compartment concentration, obtained by simultaneous pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, was compared.
Electroencephalogram approximate entropy decreased continuously over the observed concentration range of desflurane. The performance of the approximate entropy (prediction probability PK = 0.86 +/- 0.06) as an indicator for desflurane concentrations is similar to spectral edge frequency 95 (PK = 0.86 +/- 0.06) and bispectral index (PK = 0.82 +/- 0.06) and is statistically significantly better than median frequency (PK = 0.78 +/- 0.06).
The amount of regularity in the EEG increases with increasing desflurane concentrations. The approximate entropy could be a useful EEG measure of anesthetic drug effect.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10719951/
10638898,Propofol for monitored anesthesia care: implications on hypoxic control of cardiorespiratory responses.,Anesthesiology,2000,"Nieuwenhuijs D, Sarton E, Teppema L, Dahan A","Hypoxia has a dual effect on ventilation: an initial period of hyperventilation, the acute hypoxic response, is followed after 3-5 min by a slow decline, the hypoxic ventilatory decline. Because of hypoxic ventilatory decline, subsequent acute hypoxic responses are depressed. In this study, the influence of a sedative concentration of propofol on ventilation was studied if hypoxia was sustained and intermittent.
Ten healthy young male volunteers performed two hypoxic tests without and with a target controlled infusion of propofol. The sustained hypoxic test consisted of 15 min of isocapnic hypoxia followed by 2 min of normoxia and 3 min of hypoxia. The test of hypoxic pulses involved six subsequent exposures to 3 min hypoxia followed by 2 min of normoxia. The bispectral index of the electroencephalogram was measured to obtain an objective measure of sedation.
Blood propofol concentrations varied among subjects but were stable over time (mean blood concentration 0.6 microg/ml). The sustained hypoxic test showed that propofol decreased acute hypoxic response by approximately 50% and that the magnitude of hypoxic ventilatory decline relative to acute hypoxic response was increased by > 50%. Propofol increased the depression of the acute hypoxic response after 15 min of hypoxia by approximately 25%. In control and propofol studies, no hypoxic ventilatory decline was generated during exposure to hypoxic pulses. The bispectral index-acute hypoxic response data suggest that subjects were either awake (with minimal effect on acute hypoxic response) or sedated (with 50-60% reduction of acute hypoxic response).
The depression of acute hypoxic response results from an effect of propofol at peripheral or central sites involved in respiratory control or secondary to the induction of sedation or hypnosis by propofol. The relative increase in hypoxic ventilatory decline is possibly related to propofol's action at the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor complex, causing increased GABAergic inhibition of ventilation during sustained (but not intermittent) hypoxia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10638898/

Several clinical scoring systems have been developed in an attempt to provide more consistent and objective assessments of sedation, but the few that have been validated are cumbersome to use in the clinical setting and cannot accurately determine subtle changes in the level of sedation. Recent developments in EEG monitoring, particularly one using bispectral (BIS) analysis of the EEG signal obtained through a noninvasive forehead ""lead,"" are promising. BIS monitoring has been used as a reliable measure of depth of midazolam-induced sedation during general anesthesia. Anesthesiologists have used this technology to prevent awareness during paralysis. One recently completed but as yet unpublished study in the ED demonstrated a high correlation with traditional sedation scales and found the device easy to use (UNC Hospitals Department of Emergency Medicine, personal communication, 1999).

We prospectively investigated the predictive performance of both measures to distinguish between the conscious and unconscious state. Twelve patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery during regional anesthesia additionally received propofol by target-controlled infusion for sedation. The electroencephalogram BIS and the auditory evoked potential index (AEPi), a mathematical derivative of the morphology of the auditory evoked potential waveform, were recorded simultaneously in all patients during repeated transitions from consciousness to unconsciousness. Logistic regression procedures, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and sensitivity and specificity were used to compare predictive ability of both indices. In the logistic regression models, both the BIS and AEPi were significant predictors of unconsciousness (P < 0.0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for discrete descending index threshold values was apparently, but not significantly (P > 0.05), larger for the AEPi (0.968) than for the BIS (0.922), indicating a trend of better discriminatory performance. We conclude that both the BIS and AEPi are reliable means for monitoring the level of unconsciousness during propofol infusion. However, AEPi proved to offer more discriminatory power in the individual patient.
Both the bispectral index of the electroencephalogram and the auditory evoked potentials index are good predictors of the level of sedation and unconsciousness during propofol infusion. However, the auditory evoked potentials index offers better discriminatory power in describing the transition from the conscious to the unconscious state in the individual patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10553858/

Does it predict haemodynamic responses during endotracheal intubation and sternotomy?,European journal of anaesthesiology,1999,"Driessen JJ, Harbers JB, van Egmond J, Booij LH","The bispectral index, a value derived from the electroencephalogram, has been proposed as a measure of anaesthetic effect. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the bispectral index during midazolam-fentanyl anaesthesia for cardiac surgery for its possible role as a predictor of increases in systolic blood pressure during endotracheal intubation and sternotomy. After institutional approval 15 consenting patients, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, were selected for the study. Anaesthesia was induced in all patients with a loading dose of fentanyl 7.5-10 micrograms kg-1, midazolam 0.15 mg kg-1 and pancuronium 0.1 mg kg-1. After a further bolus dose of fentanyl 10-12.5 micrograms kg-1 prior to the start of incision and sternotomy, maintenance infusion rates of fentanyl 4-6 micrograms kg-1 h-1 and midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 h-1 were started and continued through surgery at the discretion of the anaesthetist and guided by the presenting clinical and haemodynamic responses. The control of anaesthesia was never based on the value of the bispectral index. The mean bispectral index value decreased from 95.7 (3.1) at base-line to 59.5 (12.0) after induction of anaesthesia and then remained below 70 throughout surgery. However, there was an important interindividual variability in bispectral index values despite standardized dosages of fentanyl and midazolam. There was no significant correlation between the bispectral index values in the pre-intubation and pre-incision period and the changes in systolic blood pressure during endotracheal intubation and sternotomy, respectively. In conclusion, the large intersubject variability in the bispectral index values should be investigated further in the light of the great variability in the clinical effects of midazolam and fentanyl. The lack of significant correlation between the bispectral index values and the haemodynamic responses suggest that the bispectral index, which is a helpful monitor of anaesthetic depth, is not a very reliable monitor of global anaesthetic adequacy during total intravenous anaesthesia with a combination of midazolam and fentanyl in cardiac surgical patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10549462/

Following Ethics Committee approval, patients were randomly assigned to one of the following four treatments: Group P (n = 17): propofol infusion, 1 mg kg-1 min-1 intravenous for 2 min, followed by propofol infusion, 200 micrograms kg-1 min-1, until skin incision; Group PF1 (n = 17): fentanyl bolus, 1 microgram kg-1 intravenous + propofol infusion as in Group P; Group PF2 (n = 17): fentanyl bolus, 2 micrograms kg-1 intravenous + propofol infusion as in Group P; and Group PF3 (n = 17): fentanyl bolus, 3 micrograms kg-1 intravenous + propofol infusion as in Group P. The bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency were monitored continuously and recorded prior to induction of anaesthesia (base-line) and at skin incision. Twelve, 10, 4 and 4 patients responded to skin incision in Groups P, PF1, PF2 and PF3, respectively (P and PF1 vs. PF2 or PF3; P = 0.0001, and 0.006). The bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency were significantly lower at skin incision compared with the base-line values in all the four treatment groups. However, only bispectral index values were significantly lower in the nonmovement as compared with the movement (M) category (32.6 +/- 8.9 vs. 37.4 +/- 10.3; P = 0.04). Though deeper levels of hypnosis to lower bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency values may be effective in preventing the movement response to skin incision, provision of adequate analgesia rather than lower bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency (clinical maintenance) values may be more reliable for preventing the response to skin incision as bispectral index and 95% spectral edge frequency measure the hypnotic component of the anaesthetic effect. Lower bispectral index values may be more discriminatory as compared with 95% spectral edge frequency values for preventing the movement response to skin-incision.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10549460/

Twenty patients (aged 17-49 yr) undergoing day surgery were anaesthetized with computer-controlled infusions of propofol. The mean (SD and range) of each measurement was determined during consciousness and unconsciousness and at specific times during the perioperative period. Mean values for AEPIndex during consciousness and unconsciousness were 74.5 (SD 14.7) 36.7 (7.1), respectively. BIS had mean values of 89.5 (SD 4.6) during consciousness and 48.8 (16.4) during unconsciousness. AEPIndex and BIS were greater during consciousness compared with during unconsciousness. The average awake values of AEPIndex were significantly higher than all average values during unconsciousness but this was not the case for BIS.

We evaluated whether the bispectral index, median frequency, or 95% spectral edge of the electroencephalogram are sensitive to the sympathetic response seen during reversal of opioid dependence. Eight patients undergoing rapid opioid detoxification gave informed consent. Two-channel frontal electroencephalogram was measured. Sympathetic heart rate variability was measured in 256 second segments by Fourier transform of continuous heart rate and the low frequency segment (0.02-0.13 Hz) analyzed for sympathetic function. Patients were anesthetized with propofol infusion. After a 30-60 min steady state, naloxone was infused intravenously at a rate of 25 mg/30 min, followed by an infusion of 1 mg/hr. During induction of anesthesia, sympathetic heart rate variability decreased from 1.80 to 0.3, bispectral index from 86 to 47, median frequency from 10.2 to 3.4, spectral edge from 23.5 to 16.7 (all P<.05). During naloxone infusion, the median percent increase in sympathetic heart rate variability was 487% (P<.05), median frequency increased 163% (P<.05), bispectral index (10%), and spectral edge (7%) did not significantly change. The increase in median frequency was delayed compared to sympathetic heart rate variability and median frequency remained elevated after sympathetic heart rate variability returned to anesthetized baseline in 5 of 8 cases. Our results show that median frequency and sympathetic heart rate variability increase during opioid detoxification, but the time course of each response is different. Median frequency is a more sensitive electroencephalogram indicator of opioid reversal than bispectral index or spectral edge.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10527144/

Prospective convenience sample.
Multidisciplinary 34-bed ICU at Maine Medical Center, a 599-bed nonuniversity, academic medical center.
Sixty-three adult ICU patients were monitored during 64 episodes of ventilatory support.
Patients were prospectively evaluated by one trained investigator using the revised Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) and were simultaneously monitored for 1 to 5 hrs using the Bispectral Index (BIS), a numeric scale from 0 to 100 derived from the electroencephalogram. BIS values were assigned to baseline, stimulated, and average conditions for each patient by a separate investigator blinded to SAS scores. Ventilator settings, medications, and the lung injury severity (LIS) score were also recorded. Sedation levels varied from very deep sedation (SAS score = 1, BIS score = 43) to mild agitation (SAS score = 5, BIS score = 100). Heavily sedated patients (SAS score = 1-2, n = 20) had higher FIO2 (0.52 vs. 0.42, p = .008), oxygenation index (9.4 vs. 5.4, p = .03), and LIS scores (1.3 vs. 0.7, p = .004) and lower baseline (66 vs. 78, p = .01), average (66 vs. 81, p < .001), and stimulated (89 vs. 96, p = .016) BIS scores compared with more awake patients. Patients with intermittent neuromuscular blockade use (n = 4) had higher FIO2 (0.65 vs. 0.44, p = .006), minute ventilation (14.6 vs. 9.9 L/min, p = .005), positive end-expiratory pressure (7.5 vs. 4.8 cm H2O, p = .05), oxygenation index (15.7 vs. 6.0, p < .001), and LIS scores (3.3 vs. 1.0, p = .036) and were more sedated, with higher suppression ratios (3.5 vs. 0.6, p = .05) and lower SAS scores (1.5 vs. 4, p = .035). The average BIS values correlated well with SAS (r2 = .21, p < .001).
SAS and BIS work well to describe the depth of sedation for ventilated ICU patients. Deeper sedation and intermittent neuromuscular blockade were used for patients with greater ventilatory requirements and more severe lung disease. The correlation between subjective and objective scales varied in medical, surgical, and trauma patients.

Heart rate (HR) variability may provide a noninvasive method of evaluating withdrawal and sympathetic activation caused by the reversal of opioid binding in patients who are opioid dependent. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between HR variability and plasma catecholamines during opioid detoxification. Patients were anesthetized with propofol, intubated, paralyzed with rocuronium infusion, and ventilated. The bispectral index (BIS) of the electroencephalogram was recorded with the patient awake as well as during propofol anesthesia. SYMP was determined by power spectral analysis of HR variability. Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured at baseline propofol anesthesia and during naltrexone treatment in eight opioid-dependent patients. Nonopioid-dependent controls (n = 7) were monitored during surgery without naltrexone treatment or measurement of plasma catecholamines. Compared with an awake status, propofol anesthesia significantly decreased the BIS and SYMP in both groups of patients. Controls showed no change from baseline anesthetized levels during surgery. Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine as well as SYMP increased 300 to 400% (P < .05) during naltrexone treatment in opioid-dependent patients, and the time to peak increase in plasma norepinephrine correlated with the increase in SYMP (r = 0.89, P < .01). These results confirm that opioid detoxification increases plasma catecholamines and SYMP in a similar manner.

Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane in N2O and O2 (33%) in 32 ASA I-II women undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation. For the first patient, the sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to 1 minimum alveolar concentration with an end-tidal concentration of 0.7%.

The goal of this investigation was to determine the time course of plasma concentration and the effects of propofol demonstrated by electroencephalogram or blood pressure changes and to compare them between elderly and young or middle-aged patients.
A target-controlled infusion was used to rapidly attain and maintain four sequentially increasing, randomly selected plasma propofol concentrations from 1 to 12 microg/ml in 41 patients aged 20-85 yr. The target concentration was maintained for about 30 min. Bispectral index (BIS), spectral edge frequency, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were used as measures of propofol effect. Because the time courses of these measures following the started drug infusion showed an exponential pattern, the first-order rate constant for equilibration of the effect site with the plasma concentration (k(eO)) was estimated by fitting a monoexponential model to the effect versus time data resulting from the pseudo-steady-state propofol plasma concentration profile.
The half-times for the plasma-effect-site equilibration for BIS were 2.31, 2.30, 2.29, and 2.37 min in patients aged 20-39, 40-59, 60-69, and 70-85 yr, respectively (n = 10 or 11 each). The half-times for SBP were 5.68, 5.92, 8.87, and 10.22 min in the respective age groups. All were significantly longer than for BIS (P < 0.05). The propofol concentration at half of the maximal decrease of SBP was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the elderly than in the younger patients.

We wanted to evaluate the direct costs of BIS monitoring and to measure immediate recovery after anaesthesia in patients with or without BIS monitoring.
Eighty patients undergoing gynaecological surgery were studied. At first, 40 patients were randomized to receive either propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia. In these patients, BIS was collected but the information was not displayed. Thereafter, the anaesthesiologists were trained to follow and understand the BIS information, and 40 patients were anaesthetized with aid of the monitoring. Recovery times were measured by a study coordinator. Drug consumption was calculated.
BIS monitoring improved the immediate recovery after propofol anaesthesia, while no differences were seen in patients receiving sevoflurane. The consumption of both propofol and sevoflurane decreased significantly (29% and 40%, respectively). BIS monitoring increased direct costs in these patients; the break-even times (704 min for propofol and 282 min for sevoflurane) were not reached.
BIS monitoring decreased the consumption of both propofol and sevoflurane and hastened the immediate recovery after propofol anaesthesia. Detailed cost analysis showed that the monitoring increased direct costs of anaesthesia treatment in these patients, mainly due to the price of special EEG electrodes used for relatively short anaesthesias.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10342003/

The authors analyzed the relationship between end-tidal sevoflurane and isoflurane concentrations (FET) and BIS and SEF and determined the speed of onset and offset of effect (t1/2k(e0)).
Twenty-four patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II were randomly assigned to receive anesthesia with sevoflurane or isoflurane. Several transitions between 0.5 and 1.5 minimum alveolar concentration were performed. BIS and SEF data were analyzed with a combination of an effect compartment and an inhibitory sigmoid Emax model, characterized by t1/2k(e0), the concentration at which 50% depression of the electroencephalogram parameters occurred (IC50), and shape parameters. Parameter values estimated are mean +/- SD.
The model adequately described the FET-BIS relationship. Values for t1/2k(e0), derived from the BIS data, were 3.5 +/- 2.0 and 3.2 +/- 0.7 min for sevoflurane and isoflurane, respectively (NS). Equivalent values derived from SEF were 3.1 +/- 2.4 min (sevoflurane) and 2.3 +/- 1.2 min (isoflurane; NS). Values of t1/2k(e0) derived from the SEF were smaller than those from BIS (P < 0.05). IC50 values derived from the BIS were 1.14 +/- 0.31% (sevoflurane) and 0.60 +/- 0.11% (isoflurane; P < 0.05).
The speed of onset and offset of anesthetic effect did not differ between isoflurane and sevoflurane; isoflurane was approximately twice as potent as sevoflurane. The greater values of t1/2k(e0) derived from the BIS data compared with those derived from the SEF data may be related to computational and physiologic delays.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10319783/

Breath-to-breath ventilatory responses to hypoxic steps (number of hypoxic steps, four-six; duration, 3 min; end-tidal oxygen tension, approximately 50 mmHg; end-tidal carbon dioxide tension clamped at approximately 4 mmHg above resting values) were assessed in nine men and nine women without and with low-dose sevoflurane (end-tidal concentration, 0.25%).

Forty-two patients were randomly assigned to receive either propofol infusion, 30 mg kg-1 h-1 (n = 22), or propofol infusion, 30 mg kg-1 h-1 + fentanyl bolus, 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v. (n = 20). Bispectral index, 95% spectral edge frequency and median frequency and propofol doses were monitored and recorded at unresponsiveness to verbal commands, loss of eyelash reflex and inhibition of nasal body movement response. The bispectral index values were significantly higher in the propofol + fentanyl compared with the propofol group, i.e. 74.7 +/- 10.9, 73.1 +/- 10.5 and 47.1 +/- 9.2 vs. 65.8 +/- 9.8, 59.6 +/- 10 and 33.8 +/- 5.7 at unresponsiveness to verbal commands, loss of eyelash reflex and inhibition of nasal body movement response respectively. Doses of propofol for achieving the hypnotic endpoints were significantly lower in the propofol + fentanyl compared with the propofol group. Plasma propofol concentrations at inhibition of nasal body movement response were lower in the propofol + fentanyl compared with the propofol group (9.2 +/- 2.0 micrograms mL-1 vs. 14.1 +/- 4.2 micrograms mL-1).

10084098,Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring during propofol-induced sedation and anaesthesia.,European journal of anaesthesiology,1999,Singh H,"One may have to use a monitor of cortical suppression to maintain the optimal level of sedation and hypnosis. The bispectral index (BIS), a processed EEG parameter, which incorporates coupling along with the frequency and amplitude of EEG waveforms, has been proposed as a measure of the pharmacodynamic anaesthetic effect on the central nervous system. The numerical value of BIS varies from 0 to 100 (no cerebral activity to fully awake patient). In order to achieve the desired level of propofol sedation or hypnosis, a target concentration of propofol at the effect site or in the blood must be delivered. Alternately, one may use BIS monitoring to monitor hypnosis or sedation levels or to reflect propofol concentrations in the blood. Significant correlations between plasma propofol concentrations and BIS values (r = 0.68-0.78) have been reported by many investigators. During propofol-induced sedation, BIS values may be maintained above 75 to prevent airway obstruction and hypoxia. During propofol intravenous anaesthesia, BIS values from 40 to 60 have been proposed to maintain the desired level of hypnosis, with values below 50 associated with an insignificant probability of recall. However, the major limitation of the BIS monitor (monitor of hypnosis) relates to the fact that balanced anaesthesia comprises hypnosis, areflexia and analgesia and requires the administration of hypnotic agents, muscle relaxants and analgesics to achieve the desired clinical effects. Therefore, besides using the BIS value guidelines, one may also consider the haemodynamic, autonomic and somatic responses of the patient, the anaesthetic technique and the surgical interventions before deriving definite conclusions about the overall anaesthetic state of the patient.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10084098/

Light sleep occurred at BIS values of 75-90, slow-wave sleep occurred at BIS values of 20-70, and rapid eye movement sleep occurred at BIS values of 75-92. The effects of natural sleep on the BIS seem to be similar to the effects of general anesthesia on the BIS. The BIS may have a role in monitoring depth of sleep.
Electroencephalographic data were collected from five subjects during sleep.

This report concerns BIS monitoring in 18 randomly selected, deeply sedated, surgical patients in the intensive care unit, who were unresponsive to standard clinical stimulation (Ramsay sedation score). A wide range of BIS was observed, with 15 of the patients having a BIS below 60, indicating a state of deep sedation (or possibly over-sedation).

Sixty consenting women undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation procedures were studied. After premedication with midazolam 2 mg IV, anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg IV, fentanyl 1.5 microg/kg IV, and succinylcholine 1 mg/kg IV and was initially maintained with either desflurane 4% (n = 31) or a propofol infusion 100 microg kg(-1) min(-1) (n = 29), in combination with nitrous oxide 65% in oxygen. Subsequently, the inspired desflurane concentrations (2%-6%) and propofol infusion rates (50-150 microg.kg(-1) min(-1) were varied to maintain a clinically acceptable depth of anesthesia. The average BIS value during the 3-min interval immediately before the discontinuation of the maintenance anesthetics was recorded. Emergence times and modified Aldrete scores were assessed from the end of anesthesia until patients were considered fast-track-eligible. The BIS values at the end of anesthesia were significantly correlated with the time to reach fast-track eligibility in both the desflurane (r = -0.68) and propofol (r = -0.76) groups. We concluded that the EEG-BIS value at the end of anesthesia is useful in predicting fast-track eligibility after laparoscopic tubal ligation procedures with either a desflurane- or propofol-based anesthetic technique.
In outpatients receiving either desflurane and propofol anesthesia for laparoscopic tubal ligation surgery, the times to achieve criteria for bypassing the recovery room (i.e., fast-tracking) correlated with the electroencephalographic-Bispectral Index values at the end of anesthesia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9842806/

The authors sought to characterize the effects of N2O on quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) variables including the bispectral index (BIS), a quantitative parameter developed to correlate with the level of sedation induced by a variety of agents.
Healthy young adult volunteers (n = 13) were given a randomized sequence of N2O/O2 combinations via face mask. Five concentrations of N2O (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% atm) were administered for 15 min (20 min for the first step). EEG was recorded from bilateral frontal poles continuously. At the end of each exposure, level of sedation was assessed using primarily the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale.
One subject withdrew from the study because of emesis at 50% N2O. N2O (50%) increased theta, beta, 40-50 Hz, and 70-110 Hz band powers. BIS and spectral edge frequency during 50% N2O/O2 did not differ significantly from baseline values. Abrupt decreases from higher to lower concentrations frequently evoked a profound, transient slowing of activity. No significant change in OAA/S was detected during the study.
Although the spectral content of the EEG changed during N2O administration, reflecting some pharmacologic effect, the subjects remained cooperative and responsive throughout, and therefore N2O can only be considered a weak sedative at the tested concentrations. Despite changes in the lower and higher frequency ranges of EEG activity, the BIS did not change, which is consistent with its design objective as a specific measure of hypnosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9743404/
9726194,Awareness during general anesthesia: new technology for an old problem.,CRNA : the clinical forum for nurse anesthetists,1998,Halliburton JR,"The possibility of awareness during general anesthesia causes apprehension for the patient and the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA). The goals of general anesthesia are to prevent the sensation of pain and produce a state of sedation, hypnosis, and unconsciousness so the patient will not remember the surgical procedure. An inadequate level of anesthesia can result in patient awareness during surgery. The current practice of anesthesia relies on indirect hemodynamic measurements such as blood pressure and heart rate to monitor the sedative hypnotic state of the patient's brain during general anesthesia. Hemodynamic responses are not reliable for predicting awareness just as blood pressure and heart rate are not indicative of consciousness. Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms are known to be affected by anesthetics. Characteristic EEG waveforms are a direct indication of the patient's level of consciousness. Unprocessed and computer-processed EEG recordings have been used in an attempt to monitor the patient's level of consciousness during general anesthesia. A raw or unprocessed EEG recording to monitor the level of consciousness during general anesthesia is problematic. The EEG signal is complex, affected by artifact, and it requires a dedicated interpreter. Conventional processed EEG monitoring systems are problematic because of the complexity of the equipment and technical difficulty of reading the EEG recording. The purpose of this article is to describe the history of awareness during anesthesia and introduce a new processed EEG monitor, the Bispectral Index (BIS) (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc., Natick, MA) with implications for future clinical use and research.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9726194/

Volunteers underwent functional brain imaging using the 18fluorodeoxyglucose technique; one scan always assessed awake-baseline cerebral metabolism (n = 7), and the other scans assessed metabolism during propofol sedation (n = 4), propofol anesthesia (n = 4), or isoflurane anesthesia (n = 5). The EEG was recorded continuously during metabolism assessment using a frontal-mastoid montage. Power spectrum variables, median frequency, 95% spectral edge, and bispectral index (BIS) values subsequently were correlated with the percentage of absolute cerebral metabolic reduction (PACMR) of glucose utilization caused by anesthesia.
The percentage of absolute cerebral metabolic reduction, evident during anesthesia, trended median frequency (r = -0.46, P = 0.11), and the spectral edge (r = -0.52, P = 0.07), and correlated with anesthetic type (r = -0.70, P < 0.05), relative beta power (r = -0.60, P < 0.05), total power (r = 0.71,P < 0.01), and bispectral index (r = -0.81,P < 0.001). After controlling for anesthetic type, only bispectral index (r = 0.40, P = 0.08) and alpha power (r = 0.37, P = 0.10) approached significance for explaining residual percentage of absolute cerebral metabolic reduction prediction error.

If a desired goal is to reduce cerebral metabolism using a barbiturate or other such agent, the EEG can be monitored to provide a measurable pharmacodynamic end point (burst suppression). Techniques have been developed to process the EEG signal using a computer and to improve on-line interpretation. These include fast Fourier transformation to develop a three-dimensional plot or compressed spectral array, evoked-potential monitoring, and bispectral analysis to derive a univariate descriptor of the EEG. These techniques have been used to detect awareness and indirect memory function, as well as to assess the adequacy of anesthesia. There is a good correlation between implicit memory and alterations in midlatency auditory-evoked responses.

The bispectral index (BIS; version 3.2), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), and median power frequency (MPF) were obtained from a bipolar frontomastoid (Fp1-A1, Fp2-A2) montage using an EEG monitor. Sedation was assessed using the responsiveness portion of the observer's assessment of alertness-sedation scale. In the second phase of the study, the 47 patients who were scheduled to have skin incisions were observed for purposeful movement in response to skin incision at sevoflurane concentrations between 1.6% and 2.4%. The relation among BIS, 95% SEF, MPF, sevoflurane concentration, sedation score, and movement or no movement after skin incision, was determined.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to compare the accuracy of (1) BIS, (2) targeted propofol concentration, (3) measured concentration, and (4) treatment history as predictors of response.
Bispectral index was a strong predictor of CS1 and CS2 (P < 0.0001) and significantly more accurate than targeted or measured propofol concentrations (P < 0.0003 and P < 0.003, respectively). It also provided additional predictive power when combined with treatment history (P < 0.02). Nitrous oxide slightly decreased the probability of response at a given value of BIS (P < 0.05), but accuracy was unaffected.
Bispectral index accurately predicts response to verbal commands during sedation and hypnosis with propofol or propofol plus nitrous oxide. Accuracy is maintained in situations likely to be encountered during clinical use: when propofol concentrations are increasing or decreasing and when repeated measurements are made over time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9447852/

BIS Utility Study Group.",Anesthesiology,1997,"Gan TJ, Glass PS, Windsor A, Payne F, Rosow C, Sebel P, Manberg P","The bispectral index (BIS), a parameter derived from the electroencephalograph (EEG), has been shown to correlate with increasing sedation and loss of consciousness. This study determined whether addition of BIS monitoring to standard anesthetic practice results in improvements in the conduct of anesthesia or in patient outcomes.
Three hundred two patients receiving a propofol-alfentanil-nitrous oxide anesthetic were studied at four institutions. Thirty-four patients were initially enrolled to determine preexisting anesthetic practice and patient outcomes at each institution. Subsequent patients were randomized to either standard clinical practice (SP group), or standard practice plus BIS monitoring (BIS group). In all patients, the anesthesiologist attempted to provide a stable anesthetic with the fastest possible recovery. BIS was recorded for all patients, but viewed only in the BIS group. In the BIS group, propofol infusions were adjusted to achieve a target BIS between 45-60, increasing to 60-75 during the final 15 min of the case. In the SP group, propofol dose adjustments were made based only on standard clinical signs. Drug use, intraoperative responses, and patient recovery parameters were recorded.
Demographics were similar between groups. Compared with the SP group, patients in the BIS group required lower normalized propofol infusion rates (134 vs. 116 microg x kg[-1] x min[-1]; P < 0.001), were extubated sooner (11.22 vs. 7.25 min; P < 0.003), had a higher percentage of patients oriented on arrival to PACU (43% vs. 23%; P < 0.02), had better postanesthesia care unit (PACU) nursing assessments (P < 0.001), and became eligible for discharge sooner (37.77 vs. 31.70 min; P <0.04). There was no significant difference in the incidence of intraoperative responses between the groups.
Titrating propofol with BIS monitoring during balanced anesthesia decreased propofol use and significantly improved recovery. Intraoperative course was not changed. These findings indicate that the use of BIS may be valuable in guiding the administration of propofol intraoperatively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9357882/

Supplement,1997,"Schneider G, Sebel PS","In clinical practice, indirect and non-specific signs are used for monitoring anaesthetic adequacy. These include haemodynamic, respiratory, muscular and autonomic signs. These measures do not indicate adequacy of anaesthesia in a reliable manner. Many attempts have been made to find a more accurate monitor. Direct monitoring of anaesthetic effect should be possible by EEG measurement. EEG information can be reduced, condensed and simplified, leading to single numbers (spectral edge frequency and median frequency). These methods appear insufficient for assessing anaesthetic adequacy. The bispectral index, derived from bispectral analysis of the EEG, is a very promising tool for measuring adequacy of anaesthesia. An alternative approach is to monitor evoked potentials. Middle latency auditory evoked potentials may be helpful in assessing anaesthetic adequacy. Both techniques need further validation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9202934/

To establish its utility for this purpose, it is important to determine the relation among BIS, measured drug concentration, and increasing levels of sedation. This study was designed to evaluate this relation for four commonly used anesthetic drugs: propofol, midazolam, isoflurane, and alfentanil.
Seventy-two consenting volunteers were studied at four institutions. Volunteers were given either isoflurane, propofol, midazolam, or alfentanil. Each volunteer was administered a dose-ranging sequence of one of the study drugs to achieve predetermined target concentrations. A frontal montage was used for continuous recording of the EEG. At each pseudo-steady-state drug concentration, a BIS score was recorded, the participant was shown either a picture or given a word to recall, an arterial blood sample was obtained for subsequent analysis of drug concentration, and the participant was evaluated for level of sedation as determined by the responsiveness portion of the observer's assessment of the alertness/ sedation scale (OAAS). An OAAS score of 2 or less was considered unconscious. The BIS (version 2.5) score was recorded in real-time and the BIS (version 3.0) was subsequently derived off-line from the recorded raw EEG data. The relation among BIS, measured drug concentration, responsiveness score, and presence or absence of recall was determined by linear and logistic regression for both the individual drugs and, when appropriate, for the pooled results. The prediction probability was also calculated.
The BIS score (r = 0.883) correlated significantly better than the measured propofol concentration (r = -0.778; P < 0.05) with the responsiveness score. The BIS provided as effective correlation with responsiveness score of the OAAS as did the measured concentration for midazolam and isoflurane. None of the volunteers given alfentanil lost consciousness and thus were excluded from the pooled analysis. The pooled BIS values at which 50% and 95% of participants were unconscious were 67 and 50, respectively. The prediction probability values for BIS ranged from 0.885-0.976, indicating a very high predictive performance for correctly indicating probability of loss of consciousness.
The BIS both correlated well with the level of responsiveness and provided an excellent prediction of the loss of consciousness. These results imply that BIS may be a valuable monitor of the level of sedation and loss of consciousness for propofol, midazolam, and isoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9105228/

This prospective multicenter study was designed to evaluate the real-time utility of BIS in predicting movement response to skin incision using a variety of general anesthetic techniques. Three hundred patients from seven study sites received an anesthetic regimen expected to give an approximately 50% movement response at skin incision. EEG was continuously recorded via an Aspect B-500 monitor and BIS was calculated in real time from bilateral frontocentral channels displayed on the monitor. Half of the patients were randomized to a treatment group in which anesthetic drug doses were increased to produce a lower BIS. In the control group, BIS was recorded, but no action taken on the data displayed. A determination of movement in response to skin incision was made in the 2 min succeeding incision. Retrospective pharmacodynamic modeling was performed using STANPUMP to estimate effect-site concentrations of intravenously administered anesthetics. BIS values were significantly higher in the control group (66 +/- 19) versus the BIS-guided group, in which additional anesthesia was administered to produce a lower BIS (51 +/- 19). The movement response rate was significantly higher in the control group at 43% compared with 13% in the BIS-guided group, but response rates were low at sites which used larger doses of opioids. Logistic regression analysis showed that BIS, estimated opioid effect-site concentrations, and heart rate (in that order) were the best predictors of movement at skin incision. This study demonstrates that dosing anesthetic drugs to lower BIS values achieves a lower probability of movement in response to surgical stimulation. BIS is a significant predictor of patient response to incision, but the utility of the BIS depends on the anesthetic technique being used. When drugs such as propofol or isoflurane are used as the primary anesthetic, changes in BIS correlate with the probability of response to skin incision. When opioid analgesics are used, the correlation to patient movement becomes much less significant, so that patients with apparently ""light"" EEG profiles may not move or otherwise respond to incision. Therefore, the adjunctive use of opioid analgesics confounds the use of BIS as a measure of anesthetic adequacy when movement response to skin incision is used as the primary end point.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9085977/

Bispectral index and isolated forearm technique.,Anesthesiology,1997,"Flaishon R, Windsor A, Sigl J, Sebel PS","Currently, there exists no effective monitor that can predict the probability of a patient being conscious during general anesthesia. The electroencephalogram-derived bispectral index (BIS) is a promising new method to assess anesthetic adequacy. This study used the BIS to predict the probability of recovery of consciousness after a single bolus induction dose of propofol or thiopental.
Twenty unpremedicated surgical patients were anesthetized with 4 mg/kg thiopental and 20 patients with 2 mg/kg propofol. The BIS was monitored throughout the study. After induction, before administration of neuromuscular blocking agent, a tourniquet was applied to one arm and inflated above the systolic blood pressure. This allowed preservation of the ability to move the hand after neuromuscular blocking agent onset. Patients were then prompted to squeeze the investigator's hand every 30 s, until they responded to the request. At the time of response, anesthesia was reinduced and the study terminated.
The BIS at loss of consciousness and recovery of a response was not statistically different between propofol and thiopental. No patient with a BIS less than 58 was conscious. In both groups, a BIS of less than 65 signified a less than 5% probability of return of consciousness within 50 s.
The BIS can be used to predict probability of recovery of consciousness after a single injection of either thiopental or propofol.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9066327/

Bispectral analysis is a new quantitative technique that measures the consistency of the phase and power relationships and returns a single measure, the bispectral index. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the bispectral index, version 1.1, with other spectral analysis EEG measures of drug effect for three commonly used anesthetic drugs.
The EEG waveforms from 31 adults receiving infusions of alfentanil, propofol, or midazolam were analyzed. The time course of spectral edge (SE95), relative power in delta band, and bispectral index were related to the estimated effect-site concentration with use of a sigmoidal Emax model to estimate the potency (IC50) and the plasma effect-site equilibration rate constant (Ke0) for each measure. The performance of the fitting was assessed by the coefficient of correlation between predicted and observed effect.
Alfentanil induced a high-amplitude low-frequency EEG response. Propofol induced a biphasic response. At low concentrations, both frequency and amplitude increased. When the concentration increased, the EEG slowed and the amplitude decreased. High concentration produced burst suppression. Midazolam increased EEG frequency and amplitude. Bispectral index, SE95, and delta power yield similar estimates of IC50 and ke0. Except for alfentanil, the performance of the modeling with the bispectral index was as good that with SE95 or delta power.

This prospective study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the BIS index and 95% SEF for assessing the level of propofol-induced sedation and amnesia during regional anesthesia. Ten consenting adult patients undergoing surgery with regional anesthesia were administered propofol in increments of 10-20 mg i.v., every 5-10 min until they became unresponsive to tactile stimulation (i.e., mild prodding or shaking). The BIS index and 95% SEF were continuously recorded from a bifrontal montage (Fp1-Cz and Fp2-Cz) using the Aspect B500 monitor. The depth of sedation was assessed clinically at 5- to 10-min intervals using the observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale, with 1 = no response to tactile stimulation to 5 = wide awake. Each patient was shown a picture of an animal (cat) prior to administration of an initial dose of propofol, 40 mg i.v.. Subsequently, patients were administered intermittent bolus doses of propofol, 10-20 mg i.v., and shown different pictures upon achieving OAA/S scores of 4, 3, and 2 during the onset of and recovery from propofol-induced sedation. Picture recall was tested upon arrival of the patient in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Of the two EEG variables studied, the BIS index exhibited a better correlation with the OAA/S scores during both the onset (Spearman's rho = 0.744) and recovery (Spearman's rho = 0.705) phases of propofol-induced sedation. With the increasing depth of sedation, there was a progressive decrease in the BIS index (OAA/S score of 5, BIS = 94.5 +/- 2.9; 4, 93.3 +/- 3.3; 3, 89 +/- 6.1; 2, 80.1 +/- 8.7; 1, 75.6 +/- 7.5; mean +/- SD).

Although the changes in the 95% SEF values were less consistent during the onset phase, this EEG variable increased from 16.4 +/- 5.0 to 19.3 +/- 5.6 as the OAA/S score increased from 1 to 4 during the recovery phase. Patient recall of the intraoperative pictures decreased with increasing depth of sedation and decreasing BIS values (OAA/S:% BIS:% recall = 5:94.5 +/- 2.9:100%; 4:93.4 +/- 3:63%; 3:87.3 +/- 6.1:40%; 2:80.8 +/- 8.3:0%; 1:75.6 +/- 7.5:0%).

Step decreases in end-tidal partial pressure of oxygen from normoxia into hypoxia (approximately 50 mmHg) were performed in 11 healthy volunteers. Four acute hypoxic ventilatory responses were obtained per subject: one in the absence of pain and sevoflurane (C), one in the absence of sevoflurane with noxious stimulation in the form of a 1-Hz electrical current applied to the skin over the tibial bone (C + P), one in the absence of pain during the inhalation of 0.1 minimum alveolar concentration sevoflurane (S), and one during 0.1 minimum alveolar concentration sevoflurane with noxious stimulation (S + P). The end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide was held constant at a value slightly greater than baseline (44 mmHg). To assess the central nervous system arousal state, the bispectral index of the electroencephalogram was monitored. Values are mean +/- SE.
Pain caused an increase in prehypoxic baseline ventilation before and during sevoflurane inhalation: C = 13.7 +/- 0.9 l.min-1, C + P = 16.0 +/- 1.0 l.min-1 (P < 0.05 vs. C and S), S = 12.7 +/- 1.2 l.min-1, and S + P = 15.9 +/- 1.1 l.min-1 (P < 0.05 vs. C and S). Sevoflurane decreased the acute hypoxic ventilatory response in the absence and presence of noxious stimulation: C = 0.69 +/- 0.20 l.min-1 (% change in arterial hemoglobin-oxygen saturation derived from pulse oximetry [SpO2])-1, C + P = 0.64 +/- 0.13 l.min-1.%SpO2(-1), S = 0.48 +/- 0.15 l.min-1.%SpO2(-1) (P < 0.05 vs. C and C + P) and S + P = 0.46 +/- 0.21 l.min-1.%SpO2(-1) (P < 0.05 vs. C and C + P). The bispectral indexes were C = 96.2 +/ 0.7, C + P = 97.1 +/- 0.4, S = 86.3 +/- 1.3 (P < 0.05), and S + P = 95.0 +/- 1.0.
The observation that acute pain caused an increase in baseline ventilation with no effect on the acute hypoxic ventilatory response indicates that acute pain interacted with ventilatory control without modifying the effect of low-dose sevoflurane on the peripheral chemoreflex loop. Acute pain increased the level of arousal significantly during sevoflurane inhalation but did not restore the approximately 30% depression of the acute hypoxic ventilatory response by sevoflurane. The central nervous system arousal state per se did not contribute to the impairment of the acute hypoxic ventilatory response by sevoflurane.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8712445/

Two treatments were compared: group 1 (n = 8) received propofol for induction of anesthesia (2 mg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 0.20 mg/kg-1/min-1, group 2 (n = 8) was given 90 micrograms/kg midazolam 2 min before, followed by anesthesia with half-strength propofol (1 mg/kg bolus with infusion of 0.10 mg/kg-1/min-1). The bispectral index of the electroencephalogram, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured under unanesthetized conditions, during anesthetic induction, intubation, and a 15-min period after intubation. The duration of anesthesia and the total propofol requirement were recorded. Midazolam pretreatment produced transient decreases in blood pressure and the bispectral index. During anesthetic induction with propofol, blood pressure decreased 20% in both groups, and the bispectral index decreased to lower levels in group 1 (29 +/- 9) than in group 2 (47 +/- 22). Intubation increased blood pressure more in group 2 (50 +/- 10 mm Hg) than in group 1 (30 +/- 12 mm Hg). Throughout the rest of the surgery, more propofol was used in group 1 (77 +/- 14 micrograms/kg-1/min-1) than in group 2 (42 +/- 14 micrograms/kg-1/min-1). These results show that the decrease in bispectral index provides an indication of the blood pressure increase to intubation during propofol anesthesia.

A prospective study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of various EEG parameters for assessing midazolam-induced sedation during regional anesthesia.
Twenty-six consenting adult patients were administered 4.5-20 mg intravenous midazolam (in increments of 0.5-1 mg bolus doses every 6-10 min) until they became unresponsive to tactile stimulation (i.e., mild prodding or shaking). The EEG was continuously recorded from a bifrontal montage (FP1-Cz and FP2-Cz) to obtain the bispectral index (BI), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF), median frequency (MF), and delta, theta, alpha, and beta power bands. Sedation was assessed clinically at 6-10-min intervals using the Observers' Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale, with 1 = no response (unconsciousness) to tactile stimulation to 5 = wide awake. The EEG parameters were correlated with the OAA/S scores using nonparametric Spearman's rank-correlation analysis. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance was used to determine significant changes in EEG parameters during the onset of and recovery from midazolam-induced sedation.
Of the EEG parameters studied, the BI exhibited the best correlation with OAA/S scores during both the onset (Spearman's Rho = 0.815) and recovery (Spearman's Rho = 0.596) phases. With increasing sedation, there was a progressive decrease in the BI (OAA/S score of 5: BI = 95.4 +/- 2.3; 4: 90.3 +/- 4.5; 3:86.6 +/- 4.6; 2:75.6 +/- 9.7; 1:69.2 +/- 13.9). A similar pattern was found for the 95% SEF as the OAA/S score decreased from 4 to 1. Similarly, EEG-BI increased with recovery from the sedative effects of midazolam (OAA/S score = 2:BI = 75.2 +/- 10.2; 3:82.3 +/- 7.3; 4:90.8 +/- 6). However, no consistent changes were found with the other EEG parameters. The mean EEG values between OAA/S scores 3 and 2 and between OAA/S scores 2 and 1 during the onset and recovery phases from midazolam-induced sedation, defined as EEG50 values for response to verbal command (EEG50-VC) and to shaking of the head (EEG50-SH), were 79.3 +/- 8 and 70.8 +/- 14.3, respectively, for EEG-BI. The EEG-BI displayed the smallest coefficients of variation for the EEG50-VC and EEG50-SH values.

In this study, the ability of modeled propofol effect-site concentration to predict movement in volunteers during propofol/nitrous oxide anesthesia was tested, then it was compared with the predictive abilities of the Bispectral Index and 95% spectral edge frequency of the electroencephalogram, pupillary reflex amplitude, and systolic arterial blood pressure. In addition, the relationships between simple end points of loss and recovery of consciousness, and pupillary, hemodynamic, and propofol concentration indicators were studied.
Ten healthy volunteers were anesthetized with an infusion of propofol, which was increased in three equal steps to 21 mg.kg lean body mass-1.h-1. After loss of the ability to hold a syringe and of the eyelash reflex, 60% nitrous oxide was introduced and the trachea was intubated without the use of muscle relaxants. The propofol infusion rate then was decreased to 15.4 mg.kg lean body mass-1.h-1. Ten minutes later, tetanic electrical stimulation was administered to the thigh via needle electrodes: if movement was observed within 1 min, the propofol infusion rate was increased by 1.75 mg.kg lean body mass-1.h-1 5 min after the stimulus; if not, it was similarly decreased. This 15-min sequence was repeated until volunteers ""crossed over"" from movement to no movement (or vice versa) four times. The propofol infusion rate then was increased to 21 mg.kg lean body mass-1.h-1, nitrous oxide was discontinued, the trachea was extubated, and the infusion rate was decreased in five equal steps over 50 min. The times at which the eyelash reflex returned and the birth date was recalled were recorded. The electroencephalogram was monitored continuously (FP1, FP2, ref: nasion, ground: mastoid). Measurements of the pupillary response, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded during induction and awakening, just before and for 5 min after each stimulation. Arterial blood samples were obtained for propofol assay, and propofol effect-site concentrations were calculated at each time. The predictive value of indicators was compared using a new static, the prediction probability (PK).
Loss and return of the eyelash reflex occurred at greater propofol effect-site concentrations than either dropping the syringe or recall of the birthday. The propofol effect-site concentration (in the presence of 60% nitrous oxide) predicted to prevent movement after a supramaximal stimulus in 50% of volunteers was 1.80 micrograms/ml (95% confidence limits: 1.40-2.34 micrograms/ml). The Bispectral Index (PK = 0.86), 95% spectral edge frequency (PK = 0.81), pupillary reflex amplitude (PK = 0.74), and systolic arterial blood pressure (PK = 0.78) did not differ significantly from modeled propofol effect-site concentration (PK = 0.76) in their ability to predict movement.
Indicators of pharmacodynamic effect, such as the electroencephalogram, pupillary light reflex, and systolic arterial blood pressure, predict movement as well as effect-site concentration during propofol/nitrous oxide anesthesia. Loss and return of the eyelash reflex correspond to a deeper level of anesthesia than syringe-dropping or recall of the birth date.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8572354/

Fourteen healthy, male volunteers were studied on three randomly ordered days: no propofol, target propofol blood concentration 1 microgram/mL, and target propofol blood concentration 2 micrograms/mL. Each day, epidural anesthesia (approximately T11 level) was induced using 2% 2-chloroprocaine. Propofol was infused by a computer-controlled pump, and propofol concentration measured in central venous blood. We administered a Trivial Pursuit-type question task on all 3 days. The electroencephalogram was monitored continuously (Fp1, Fp2; reference, Cz; ground, mastoid). Propofol caused concentration-related impairment of learning. The propofol blood concentration suppressing learning by 50% was 0.66 +/- 0.1 microgram/mL. The Bispectral Index value when learning was suppressed by 50% was 91 +/- 1. In contrast, the 95% spectral edge frequency did not correlate well with learning. The Bispectral Index decreased linearly as propofol blood concentration increased (Bispectral Index = -7.4.[propofol] + 90; r2 = 0.47, n = 278).

This study was designed to test the efficacy of BIS in predicting movement to incision during either an isoflurane/alfentanil anesthetic or a propofol/alfentanil anesthetic technique. Fifty consenting patients were randomized to two groups; one received isoflurane/alfentanil and the other, propofol/alfentanil for anesthesia. EEG was recorded using a microcomputer system and the data were analyzed off-line. Hemodynamic variables were also recorded. After skin incision, each patient was observed carefully for 2 min to detect purposeful movement. A significant difference was found between the BIS values for movers versus nonmovers within each of the two treatment groups (P < or = 0.002). However, isoflurane/alfentanil nonmovers could not be distinguished from propofol/alfentanil movers (P < or = 0.180), suggesting a treatment group effect independent of response classification. Preincision hemodynamic variables did not predict patient movement in response to skin incision. These findings suggest the possibility that different anesthetics have different effects on BIS, and thus BIS may not be independent of the anesthetic. Interfrequency phase coupling, a nonlinear feature of the EEG which is measured with bispectral analysis, may contain clinically useful information for the assessment of anesthetic adequacy. In this study, BIS was a better predictor of patient response than other currently available variables including hemodynamic status.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7893035/
7760092,EEG bispectrum predicts movement during thiopental/isoflurane anesthesia.,Journal of clinical monitoring,1995,"Sebel PS, Bowles SM, Saini V, Chamoun N","The objective of our study was to test the efficacy of the bispectral index (BIS) compared with spectral edge frequency (SEF), relative delta power, median frequency, and a combined univariate power spectral derivative in predicting movement to incision during isoflurane/oxygen anesthesia.
A total of 42 consenting patients were assigned to 3 groups, isoflurane 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC). Anesthesia was induced with thiopental and maintained with the appropriate end-tidal concentration of isoflurane. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using a microcomputer system, and data were analyzed off-line. The EEG during the 2 min before incision was analyzed. Following skin incision, each patient was carefully observed for 60 sec to detect occurrence of purposeful movement.
For all groups combined, there was a statistically significant difference for BIS (p < 0.0001) and also for relative delta power (p < 0.016) between movers and nonmovers. There was a statistically significant difference between movers and nonmovers at 1.25 MAC isoflurane for BIS (p < 0.01). There were no other significant differences for any other EEG variable at any concentration of isoflurane. No EEG variable showed a relationship to isoflurane concentration.
When bispectral analysis of the EEG was used to develop a retrospectively determined index, there was an association of the index with movement. Thus, it may be a useful predictor of whether patients will move in response to skin incision during anesthesia with isoflurane/oxygen.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7760092/
7992904,Bispectral analysis of the electroencephalogram correlates with patient movement to skin incision during propofol/nitrous oxide anesthesia.,Anesthesiology,1994,"Kearse LA, Manberg P, Chamoun N, deBros F, Zaslavsky A","Bispectral analysis is a signal-processing technique that determines the harmonic and phase relations among the various frequencies in the electroencephalogram. Our purpose was to compare the accuracy of a bispectral descriptor, the bispectral index, with that of three power spectral variables (95% spectral edge, median frequency, and relative delta power) in predicting patient movement in response to skin incision during propofol-nitrous oxide anesthesia.
Forty-four adult patients scheduled for elective noncranial surgery were studied. Gold cup electroencephalographic electrodes were placed on each patient in a frontoparietal montage (Fp1, Fp2, P3, and P4) referred to Cz, and the electroencephalogram was recorded continuously and processed off-line. Conventional frequency bands were used to describe power spectrum variables. Anesthesia was induced with propofol (1.5-3.0 mg-1.kg-1) and maintained with 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen and with propofol at one of three randomized infusion rates (100, 200, or 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). Inadequate anesthetic depth was defined as patient movement in response to a 2-cm skin incision at the planned site of surgery. Plasma propofol concentrations were measured within 2 min after skin incision.
Complete data were available for 38 patients, of whom 17 moved in response to skin incision. Analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves showed that only for bispectral index and drug dose group was there a significant predictive relation (area > 0.5). Furthermore, the bispectrum was significantly predictive even after stratification by dose group.
The bispectral index of the electroencephalogram is a more accurate predictor of patient movement in response to skin incision during propofol-nitrous oxide anesthesia than are standard power spectrum parameters or plasma propofol concentrations.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7992904/
7836975,An introduction to bispectral analysis for the electroencephalogram.,Journal of clinical monitoring,1994,"Sigl JC, Chamoun NG","The goal of much effort in recent years has been to provide a simplified interpretation of the electroencephalogram (EEG) for a variety of applications, including the diagnosis of neurological disorders and the intraoperative monitoring of anesthetic efficacy and cerebral ischemia. Although processed EEG variables have enjoyed limited success for specific applications, few acceptable standards have emerged. In part, this may be attributed to the fact that commonly used signal processing tools do not quantify all of the information available in the EEG. Power spectral analysis, for example, quantifies only power distribution as a function of frequency, ignoring phase information. It also makes the assumption that the signal arises from a linear process, thereby ignoring potential interaction between components of the signal that are manifested as phase coupling, a common phenomenon in signals generated from nonlinear sources such as the central nervous system (CNS). This tutorial describes bispectral analysis, a method of signal processing that quantifies the degree of phase coupling between the components of a signal such as the EEG. The basic theory underlying bispectral analysis is explained in detail, and information obtained from bispectral analysis is compared with that available from the power spectrum. The concept of a bispectral index is introduced. Finally, several model signals, as well as a representative clinical case, are analyzed using bispectral analysis, and the results are interpreted.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7836975/
7511501,Bispectral analysis of the electroencephalogram during induction of anesthesia may predict hemodynamic responses to laryngoscopy and intubation.,Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology,1994,"Kearse LA, Manberg P, DeBros F, Chamoun N, Sinai V","The use of electroencephalography as a measure of adequacy of anesthesia has achieved limited success. Our purpose was to determine whether the non-linear properties of the electroencephalogram (EEG) as defined by the bispectral index was a better predictor of autonomic responses to endotracheal intubation during opioid-based anesthesia than the linear statistical properties of the EEG formulated by power spectral analysis. Thirty-nine adults scheduled for elective non-cranial surgery had a continuous EEG recorded during induction of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia consisted of thiopental and nitrous oxide in oxygen, followed by 1 of 5 randomized opioid dose regimens. The EEG was continuously recorded and blood pressure was measured every minute. All electroencephalographic parameters were derived for the 3 min before and after intubation and were compared to the blood pressure and heart rate responses. Responders were defined by 2 analyses: patients who had a 20% or greater increase (1) in blood pressure or (2) in heart rate to laryngoscopy. Responders and non-responders were compared using Student's unpaired t test, and differences due to dose regimens were examined with logistic regression. Based on the criterion for blood pressure change, there were 27 responders and 12 non-responders. Heart rate changes did not differentiate between the two groups. There was a significant difference between response groups as measured by the bispectral index which distinguished responders from non-responders independently of the amount of drug given. None of the variables of power spectral analysis accurately distinguished responder from non-responder.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7511501/
8217181,Mild core hyperthermia does not alter electroencephalographic responses during epidural-enflurane anesthesia in humans.,Journal of clinical anesthesia,1993,"Lopez M, Ozaki M, Sessler DI, Valdes M","To determine the electroencephalographic (EEG) changes induced by mild hyperthermia during enflurane anesthesia and to test the reliability of two new infrared thermometers.
Prospective laboratory evaluation.
The Thermoregulation Research Laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco.
6 healthy female volunteers aged 30 +/- 8 years.
Epidural anesthesia (approximately T10 dermatome) was induced and maintained using 2-chloroprocaine anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced by inhalation of nitrous oxide and enflurane and maintained with enflurane at an end-tidal concentration of 1.7%. A minimum of 2 degrees C core hyperthermia was induced by active cutaneous warming, and the volunteers subsequently were passively cooled.
EEG data were recorded from gold cup electrodes positioned at FP1 and FP2, with the reference electrode at CZ and the ground lead on the mastoid. In addition to routine EEG parameters, we evaluated the bispectral index. Bispectral analysis quantifies the phase coupling between various frequencies in the power spectrum and may be a useful measure of anesthetic depth. Core temperature was measured at the left tympanic membrane and distal esophagus. Core temperature also was determined from the right ear using two new, infrared tympanic membrane thermometers. One of these directly measures tympanic temperature, and the other extrapolates core temperature from the external ear canal. Induction of 2 degrees C core hyperthermia did not produce statistically significant or clinically important changes in beta or delta power, the 95% spectral edge frequency, or the bispectral index. Temperatures recorded from the right ear by the direct thermometer were 0.27 degrees C +/- 0.33 degrees C less than those measured in the left ear, but the values correlated well (r2 = 0.95 +/- 0.04). Temperatures recorded from the right ear by the core temperature extrapolater were 0.42 degrees C +/- 0.33 degrees C lower than those measured in the left ear, and the correlation between values was slightly worse (r2 = 0.83 +/- 0.16).
Since mild core hyperthermia does not alter routine EEG parameters or the bispectral index, typical perianesthetic thermal disturbances are unlikely to obscure EEG estimates of anesthetic depth. Both the direct thermometer and the core temperature extrapolater were found to be sufficiently accurate and precise for routine clinical use, but the direct thermometer would be preferable in the perioperative period.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8217181/
