Anesthesia and its environmental impact: approaches 
to minimize exposure to anesthetic gases and reduce 
waste
Abstract  
In today’s era of modern healthcare, the intersection between medical practices and 
environmental responsibility has gained significant attention. One such area of focus is the 
practice of anesthesia, which plays a crucial role in various surgical procedures. Anesthetics 
such as nitrous oxide and volatile halogenated ethers (desflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane) are 
examples of medical gases that are strong greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. 
During medical procedures, most of these anesthetic agents are released into the atmosphere, 
which exacerbates their influence on the environment. Also anesthesia delivery systems have 
traditionally utilized high flow rates of gases, leading to not only excessive consumption but 
also a considerable environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. However, the 
emergence of low-flow anesthesia (LFA) presents a promising solution for achieving emission 
reduction and cost savings, thereby aligning healthcare practices with sustainability goals. 
Understanding LFA involves the administration of anesthetic gases to patients at reduced 
flow rates compared to conventional high-flow methods. This practice requires precision in 
gas delivery, often incorporating advanced monitoring and control systems. By optimizing gas 
flow to match the patient’s requirements, LFA minimizes wastage and excessive gas release 
into the environment, subsequently curbing the carbon footprint associated with healthcare 
operations. Decreasing volatile anesthetic delivery provides safe and effective strategies for 
anesthesia providers to decrease costs and reduce environmental pollution. Current literature 
support in favor of LFA represents an area of cost containment and an opportunity to lessen the 
environmental impact of anesthesia. This article will cover the concept of LFA, the distinctions 
between low flow and minimal flow, and the potential advantages of LFA, such as those related 
to patient safety, the environment, and the economy.

Introduction 
Acute care settings rank as the second most energy-
intensive industry, following food service facilities, making 
healthcare a carbon-intensive service. In the United States, 
it accounts for 8% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.1 
During perioperative activities, which are especially resource-
intensive, operating rooms consume 3 to 6 times more energy 
than hospitals overall.2 Numerous scientific studies have 
demonstrated that all vapors and agents that can currently 
be inhaled are GHGs that contribute to global warming. 
However, many anesthesia providers are only vaguely aware 
of how our field contributes to GHGs and how each gas 
affects the environment differently. Limiting unnecessary 
GHG emissions can significantly lessen the detrimental effects 
on our environment given the prevalence of using inhaled 
anesthetics.3 Anesthesia providers must extensively utilize 
available resources to practice low-flow anesthesia (LFA), as 
anesthetic gases contribute significantly to environmental 
pollution. 
The goal of LFA is to minimize the waste of inhaled anesthetics 
that are harmful to the environment.4 Aside from the economic 
and ecological advantages, it also offers physiological benefits 
including maintained heat and humidity, enhanced mucociliary 
function, and maybe lessened oxidative damage. This is 
achieved by providing anesthetic gases at lower flow rates.5 
Despite its benefits, anesthesiologists continue to disagree 
over the use of LFA due to concerns about renal damage and 
compound A exposure.6 Studies demonstrating decreased 
oxidative damage and comparable hemodynamic parameters 
and recovery durations in obese individuals following 
laparoscopic surgery7 support the notion that LFA with 
sevoflurane can be safe and beneficial. LFA, when combined 
with patient safety, cost-effectiveness, and environmental 
factors, offers a promising approach to anesthesiology practice 
overall.
By learning about each inhaled agent’s atmospheric lifespan 
and global warming potential (GWP) and using these agents 
responsibly, anesthetists may significantly contribute to the

reduction of emissions. The aim of this narrative review is 
to summarize the current knowledge on global warming, 
anesthesia’s impact on the environment, ways to minimize 
anesthetic gas exposure and waste, alternative options to 
inhalational anesthesia, and the financial and environmental 
outcomes of manual versus automated end-tidal gas 
concentration management.
Search Strategy 
A systematic search was conducted on PubMed to locate 
English-language articles published between January 1, 2000 
and July 30, 2023, using the search terms “anesthesia” and 
“greenhouse gas,” ensuring the inclusion of recent literature. 
Of the 48 articles retrieved, 9 were excluded for the lack 
of relevance to environmental or occupational exposure to 
inhaled anesthetic gases or their mitigation. The remaining 
pertinent articles were collected and reviewed, along with an 
examination of the references cited within them.
Global Warming Theories
The explanation of important terms pertaining to the 
impact of GHG emissions on global warming will help 
anesthesiologists comprehend these mechanisms and become 
knowledgeable about the availability of more environmentally 
friendly anesthetic alternatives.
GWP is a scale that compares a gas’s effect to that of the 
same mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) by measuring how much 
heat it traps in the atmosphere. It is a measurement of the 
amount of energy that 1 tons of gas emissions will absorb 
over a specific period, which is typically 100 years, and is 
denoted by the abbreviation GWP100. This measurement is 
made in comparison to 1 tonne of CO2 emissions. Because it is 
the gas used as the reference, CO2 by definition has a GWP of 
1, regardless of the period used. Consequently, GWP reflects 
both the length of time a gas spends in the atmosphere and 
the intensity of its energy absorption.8
The term “global warming” describes a sustained rise in the 
planet’s surface temperature.9 The amount of CO2 released 
is known as the “carbon footprint” and is used as a baseline 
when assessing the GWP of other substances.9 Radiative 
forcing is the ratio of the amount of infrared energy radiated 
back to space to the amount of sunlight (radiation) absorbed 
into the Earth’s internal climate. Since half of the Earth’s 
surface receives sunlight every day, energy is constantly 
entering the atmosphere. 30% of this sunlight is reflected 
into space, leaving the remaining 70% for the planet to 
absorb.10 When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it causes a 
phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect, or greenhouse 
gases (GHGs). Instead of being released back into space, heat 
is absorbed by GHGs and raises the temperature within the 
atmosphere.10 GHGs that trap infrared heat raise temperatures 
over time by altering the Earth’s radiative equilibrium. The 
greenhouse effect is a naturally occurring phenomenon on our 
planet and is responsible for regulating the temperature on 
the Earth. GHGs such as CO2, methane (CH4), and water vapor 
retain some of the radiation that is emitted by the sun on the 
Earth’s surface in the form of heat. The greenhouse effect is 
fundamental for the maintenance of the ideal temperature 
for life on the Earth; without the presence of this effect, the 
average temperature of the planet would be very low and 
difficult for the survival of many species. 
The environmental impact of anesthesia practice is a topic 
of growing concern, and the GWP of inhalation anesthetics 
is a term connected to this concern. Each anesthetic has a 
different infrared absorption spectrum, and this, along with its 
atmospheric lifetime, determines how much of a GHG it will 
be. Until that gas breaks down in the atmosphere, it continues 
to have an impact on the environment. The imbalance is most 
effectively assessed near the border between the troposphere, 
the lowest layer of the atmosphere, and the stratosphere, the 
region with the highest concentration of ozone.8
Effects of Ozone on Global Warming
The ozone layer, which is a component of the atmosphere 
and is situated at a height of 25 km, serves as a solar filter, 
keeping most ultraviolet (UV) rays from reaching the Earth’s 
surface.11 When UV radiation interacts with GHGs, it releases 
free radicals that attack the ozone molecules in the ozone 
layer. This rarefaction of the gas results in what is known as 
a “hole in the ozone layer,” which exposes the Earth to more 
UV radiation.12 In order to prevent permanent harm to the 
environment and human health, greenhouse gas emissions 
must be severely curtailed.13 This decline is concerning 
consequences on human health. Since it can cause or 
exacerbate a number of illnesses, the impacts of this decline 
on human health are concerning and have been the focus of 
investigations by researchers worldwide.14
These findings show serious implications for human health. 
The quantity of ozone present in the atmosphere directly 
affects the amount of UV radiation that reaches the Earth’s 
surface. According to Juchem et al.,15 there is a 2.7% rise in 
the incidence of nonmelanoma skin malignancies for every 
1% decrease in atmospheric ozone, indicating that even little 
fluctuations in this layer might provide a serious health risk. 
The actions on ecosystems affect human health, disease, and 
well-being. New diseases may emerge, infectious diseases 
worsen, and chronic non-communicable diseases increase. 
Current food system may deteriorate leading to more hunger 
and malnutrition, along with hyper-urbanization, microbial 
resistance, climate migrations, and conflicts over natural 
resources.16
Anesthesia and Global Impact on Climate or 
Environment
Climate change is the biggest threat to public health, and 
minimizing the environmental impact of inhaled anesthetics 
is crucial. Strategies include avoiding nitrous oxide (N2O) and 
desflurane, using intravenous or local-regional anesthesia, 
and investing in new scavenging technologies. Occupational 
risks for healthcare professionals from long-term exposure 
to inhaled anesthetics remain a concern, necessitating

regulatory guidelines and improved safety measures. 
Anesthesia types have an impact on postoperative outcomes, 
with total intravenous anesthesia showing fewer side effects 
and growing in preference, especially in pediatric surgery. 
Ultimately, reducing the use of inhaled anesthetics, particularly 
desflurane, is essential for mitigating their environmental and 
health impacts.17 The ideal anesthesia decision should balance 
environmental impact, clinical indications, and occupational 
risk, as illustrated in the accompanying diagram (Figure 1).
CO2 and other GHGs such as N2O, methane, fossil fuels 
synthetic GHGs (fluorinated gases), and water vapor, both 
natural and man-made, contribute to global warming.10,18 
Although the GWP of water vapor has not been properly 
calculated in the literature, it is the most abundant and potent 
GHG generated from the natural water cycle (evaporation, 
condensation, and precipitation). Earth’s temperature is 
regulated by water vapor, which contributes about 60% of 
the warming effect.8 The US Global Change Research Program 
estimates that since pre-industrial times, the atmospheric 
concentrations of CO2, methane, and N2O have increased by 
about 40%, 150% and 20%, respectively. More than half of the 
CO2 rise has happened since 1970.19
Halogenated inhalation anesthetics such as isoflurane, 
desflurane, and sevoflurane have been found in the global 
atmosphere; in 2014, their mean mole fractions were 0.097 
ppt, 0.30 ppt, and 0.13 ppt.20 In 2014, anesthetics emitted 3.1 
± 0.6 million tons CO2 equivalent, with desflurane accounting 
for about 80%.21 Furthermore, the UK National Health Service 
was responsible for 2.5% of the greenhouse gas emissions 
caused by anesthetic inhalation, contributing to the estimated 
3.1 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents of volatile anesthetic 
gases emitted globally in 2014.17 Volatile anesthetics exhibit 
varying GWPs, therefore it is crucial to evaluate and limit their 
environmental impact. 
Recent investigations indicate that the United States 
healthcare sector contributes to nearly 10% of the total GHG 
emissions, with hospitals being the primary source. Over the 
decade spanning 2006 to 2016, GHG emissions associated 
with healthcare demonstrated a notable increase of 30%.22 
Notably, operating rooms generate 20% to 30% of the entire 
waste output of hospitals, establishing perioperative services 
as one of the healthcare sectors with the most substantial 
environmental impact.23
One of the main causes of climate change is the production 
of GHGs,24 which includes the discharge of waste anesthetic 
gases into the atmosphere during surgical operations (Figure 
2).25 Although anesthesia gases account for a relatively 
small proportion of GHGs, a substantial body of research 
demonstrates the importance of reducing waste anesthetic 
gas release into the environment to reduce global climate 
change contributions and associated health risks, as well as 
personal occupational exposure and risk of adverse effects. 
According to a 2019 study of global surgery metrics, 266 
million surgeries were carried out globally in 2015, with a 
global median of 4171 operations per 100,000 people.26 
This substantial volume of surgery exposes a variety of 
healthcare professionals to volatile anesthetics, including 
anesthesiologists, dentists/dental staff, nurse anesthetists, 
operating room nurses, operating room technicians/staff, 
recovery room nurses/staff, and surgeons.27

Review
Impact of Anesthetic Gases and Climate Change
GHGs like volatile anesthetics, trap energy in the atmosphere 
by absorbing infrared radiation.28 Given that the use of these 
gases is regarded as a medical necessity, volatile anesthetic 
emissions are not subject to regulation like many other GHGs. 
They do contribute to global warming, though, and we should 
not disregard that. The patient only processes less than 5% 
of the administered volatile anesthetics; the majority are 
instead released into the atmosphere.29 Healthcare activities 
are considered to be responsible for 10% of the nation’s GHG 
emissions in the United States.30
The most frequently used volatile anesthetics are N2O and 
the highly fluorinated gases sevoflurane, desflurane, and 
isoflurane, all of which have been linked to climate change 
in the past decade due to their effects on the photophysical 
characteristics of the atmosphere.28 N2O and halogenated 
gases with chlorine or bromine, like isoflurane and the

outdated drug halothane, can deplete ozone and lessen the 
ozone layer’s ability to shield against UV radiation. Sevoflurane 
and desflurane are two examples of halogenated gases 
that harm the climate even though they do not catalytically 
destroy ozone. Instead, trace amounts of these gases in the 
atmosphere absorb and reduce outgoing infrared thermal 
energy, warming the planet.31
The majority of volatile anesthetics are eliminated from the 
body through exhalation while they are being used in clinical 
settings.28 N2O, desflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane, for 
instance, are exhaled unchanged in about 95% of cases.32 
In operating rooms, these substances are usually scavenged 
from patient breath to minimize occupational exposure. 
However, these medical waste gases are discharged into the 
environment as GHGs with little to no additional processing.3
Assessing the radiative and atmospheric attributes of 
specific substances, the GWP provides a measure to 
quantify how various agents, including GHGs, contribute to 
climate change.33,34 A gas’s capacity to absorb heat from the 
atmosphere is measured by its GWP.35 Regardless of the time 
period used, CO2 has a GWP of 1 by definition. The term 
“CO2 equivalent” refers to the mass of CO2 that possesses 
an equivalent GWP as a given mass of a specific agent.36 This 
concept facilitates the comparison of the global warming 
impact of different gases. The 100-year time frame (100-
year GWP) is frequently used to calculate GWP. The chemical 
formula, 100-year GWP, CO2 equivalent, and lifetime in the 
atmosphere of frequently used volatile anesthetics are shown 
in Table 1.17,31,37
In contrast to sevoflurane, isoflurane manifests a protracted 
atmospheric persistence of 3.2 years. Its possession of a 
chlorine atom renders isoflurane proficient in ozone layer 
attenuation. Relative to other volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane 
distinguishes itself with the briefest atmospheric longevity 
at 1.1 years and a 100-year GWP of 575. However, among all 
volatile anesthetics, desflurane has the highest 100-year GWP. 
When compared to sevoflurane and isoflurane, it is also used 
at higher doses, requiring 3 to 6 times as much to achieve the 
same level of anesthesia.38 Desflurane should not be used, 
given its 14-year atmospheric lifetime, in order to reduce 
environmental harm.

Review
N2O, owing to its anesthetic properties, minimal alveolar 
concentration-sparing capability, and analgesic effects, finds 
widespread application in various medical procedures. Its 
extensive use has resulted in a notable contribution, ranging 
from 1% to 3%, to the global emissions of N2O.39 It is crucial to 
recognize that N2O not only functions as a GHG but also exerts 
ozone-depleting effects, compromising the ozone layer’s 
protection against harmful UV rays from the sun.40 Despite 
possessing a substantially lower 100-year GWP compared 
to desflurane (296 vs. 1526), N2O exhibits a significant 
atmospheric lifetime of 114 years. Moreover, in contrast 
to alternative anesthetics administered at concentrations 
ranging from 1% to 6%, it is commonly employed at elevated 
doses, typically ranging between 40% and 60%.41 This is due 
to its relatively weak anesthetic potency. Nitric oxide and 
CO2, which are GHGs, are also contaminants created during 
the synthesis of N2O.42 This data illustrates that relative to 
alternative volatile anesthetics, desflurane, and N2O exhibit 
notably adverse environmental impacts.
It is imperative to consider the enduring, cumulative influence 
of inhaled anesthetics on climate change and to actively 
pursue strategies aimed at mitigating the introduction of these 
agents into the environment. This remains paramount despite 
the relatively modest contribution of volatile anesthetics to 
total GHG emissions (0.1%), especially when juxtaposed with 
CO2 (82.2%), as depicted in Figure 2.10,31
Strategies to Minimize Exposure and Waste of 
Anesthetic Gases
The practice of anesthesia is a critical aspect of modern 
medical procedures; ensuring patients undergo surgeries 
and interventions comfortably and safely. However, the 
administration of anesthetic gases, while essential, presents 
challenges in terms of both healthcare worker exposure 
and environmental impact due to gas wastage. To tackle 
these issues, a range of strategies have been developed to 
minimize exposure and reduce the waste of anesthetic gases. 
These strategies not only prioritize the well-being of medical 
personnel but also contribute to a more sustainable and 
environmentally conscious healthcare system (Figure 3).
Limited use of volatile anesthetics with high 100-year GWP
The GWP of halogenated anesthetics can reach exceptionally 
high levels, up to 2000 times that of CO2. N2O, isoflurane, 
sevoflurane, and desflurane all possess higher GWP factors 
than N2O, with desflurane exhibiting a GWP factor five times 
greater than that of N2O. Despite this, N2O contributes the 
most to increased climate impact (99.97%), mainly due to its 
significantly higher consumption volumes compared to other 
anesthetic gases.29
Exploring the substitution of N2O with alternative anesthetic 
gases holds potential benefits, potentially achieving equivalent 
anesthetic effects with lower usage volumes, although this area 
remains unexplored. To mitigate the environmental impact of 
inhaled anesthetics, it is advisable to refrain from using N2O 
and minimize unnecessarily high fresh gas flow (FGF) rates.
Desflurane stands out with a significantly longer atmospheric 
“lifetime” of 10 years compared to 1.2 years for sevoflurane 
and 3.6 years for isoflurane. Considering the administered flow 
rates, desflurane demonstrates approximately 26 times the 
GWP of sevoflurane and 13 times the impact of isoflurane.29
Low-flow anesthesia technique
LFA techniques are gaining traction as an effective way to 
minimize gas exposure and waste. By delivering anesthetic gases 
at lower flow rates than conventional methods, healthcare 
providers can significantly reduce consumption. These 
techniques necessitate careful monitoring and adjustment to 
maintain patient comfort and safety while conserving valuable 
resources and minimizing environmental impact.
Low-flow anesthesia can refer to any technique that uses an 
FG flow that is lower than the alveolar ventilation (Table 2).43 
LFA is defined as an inhalation anesthetic technique with total 
FGFs of less than 2 L/min and at least 50% of expired gases 
(including unabsorbed inhaled anesthetics and unconsumed 
oxygen) returning to the lungs after CO2 is removed from the 
circle by the CO2 absorbent in a closed circle system. So less 
gas is released because more gases are recirculated around 
a circle system when the FGF is low. This is the only way to 
achieve the lowest possible emission of scavenged gases.44

Review
As the uptake and metabolism are time-sensitive and 
numerous factors affect the consumption and production 
of gaseous components, it is difficult to control the dynamic 
equilibrium of FG composition. This can only be accomplished 
by frequently adjusting the gas flow controls. To calculate the 
uptake of substances like oxygen, N2O, and volatile agents, 
complicated equations are used. For the safe conduct of LFA, 
monitoring inspired and end-tidal concentrations with a gas 
analyzer is a more accurate and practical method.
Use of volatile agents in low-flow anesthesia
To optimize both financial and environmental benefits 
associated with the utilization of volatile anesthetics, 
Edmonds et al.38 propose maintaining an FGF rate of 0.5 L/min 
for desflurane and keeping it below 1 L/min when isoflurane 
is employed. Due to the possibility of compound A-induced 
kidney injury, they also recommend using sevoflurane at an 
FGF rate of 1 L/min when the required minimum alveolar 
concentration hours are less than 2. However, it is important 
to keep in mind that no evidence of compound A-induced 
kidney damage that is clinically significant has been found in 
humans.
Advantages of low-flow anesthesia
LFA offers a range of advantages, encompassing cost savings, 
the prevention of environmental pollution, and substantial 
physiological benefits. These physiological advantages 
include improvements in the flow dynamics of inhaled gases, 
enhanced mucociliary clearance, preservation of the structural 
and functional integrity of respiratory tract epithelial cells, 
augmentation of the heat and humidity of rebreathed gases, 
retention of moisture in CO2 absorbent, and preservation of 
body temperature.44
Disadvantages of low-flow anesthesia
Due to a longer time constant of the inhaled agents, a higher 
consumption of CO2 absorbent, and a higher risk of hypercarbia 
and CO2 rebreathing with frequent exhaustion of absorbers, 
lower FGF causes a slower induction and emergence.44,45
To prevent hypoxic mixtures and anesthetic agent under- 
or over-dosage, constant attention and frequent flow 
adjustments are necessary. Sevoflurane should not be used in 
LFA and should be administered at > 1 L/min flows, according 
to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
To address the potential buildup of unfavorable gases like 
carbon monoxide, methane, acetone, hydrogen, ethanol, 
Compound A, argon, and nitrogen during anesthesia, it is 
recommended to flush the circuit with high fresh gas flows 
(FGFs) periodically.
The following situations do not lend themselves to LFA 
techniques46:
a) LFA is not well-known to anesthesiologists.
b) With a face mask, short-term anesthesia.
c) Procedures involving gas leakage (such as bronchoscopies-
laryngoscopies using a rigid bronchoscope).
d) Patients experiencing intoxication should be administered 
a total FGF exceeding 1 L/min to ensure a consistent washout 
effect of alcohol.
e) In order to prevent an unfavorable buildup of acetone in the 
breathing system, patients in ketoacidosis may experience an 
increase in their blood levels of acetone during anesthesia.
Automated low-flow anesthesia
Automated LFA techniques, employing devices that restrict 
FGF and recirculate gases within closed systems, have 
demonstrated efficacy in reducing volatile anesthetic 
consumption, minimizing exposure to waste anesthetic gases, 
and mitigating environmental pollution.44,47 These techniques 
utilize proprietary software algorithms to regulate the 
concentrations of end-tidal anesthetics and inspired oxygen. 
In a comparative study of manual versus automated control, 
the automated system significantly reduced GHG emissions 
by 44%.48 A study further reveals a notable reduction in 
desflurane consumption with these automated systems 
compared to traditional LFA.49 Additionally, closed filling 
systems for anesthetic vaporizers maintain waste gas exposure 
below recommended levels. Anesthetic machines equipped 
with end-tidal-controlled anesthesia autonomously adjust 
target concentrations, diminishing the necessity for manual 
interventions and enhancing overall anesthetic delivery 
efficiency. In conclusion, automated LFA techniques offer 
substantial benefits, including significant reductions in waste 
gas and improved delivery efficiency.
Several automated LFA machines presently available include 
the Zeus® (Dräger, Lubeck, Germany), the Aisys® (GE, Madison, 
WI, USA), and the Flow-i® (Maquet, Solna, Sweden).50 The 
Zeus employs closed-circuit anesthesia, while the Aisys utilizes

while lowering the ergonomic liability of LFA.50,51 Ventilators 
without these built-in algorithms can still use LFA techniques.44
Advanced scavenging systems
These systems safely interface the anesthesia breathing 
system with the hospital vacuum or other gas disposal 
system.52 Adsorptive separation using various materials, such 
as activated carbons, zeolites, and metal-organic frameworks, 
has been identified as a potential solution for removing volatile 
anesthetics from waste gas streams.53 Studies comparing 
operating rooms with and without central scavenging systems 
have shown that the use of these systems can decrease the 
concentrations of anesthetics in the air, although they may not 
always meet internationally recommended exposure limits.54 
Overall, the implementation of central scavenging systems 
and the development of innovative purification systems are 
important steps toward reducing occupational exposure to 
anesthetic gases in operating rooms.
Vaporizer efficiency and modern technology
Modern vaporizers such as the Aladin cassette vaporizer, 
injection vaporizers, and Anesthetic Converting Device, 
“AnaConDa” (Sedana Medical, Danderyd Sweden) are designed 
to minimize waste anesthetic gases in the operating room.55
The Aladin cassette vaporizer, integrated with DatexOhmeda 
S/5 ADU (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) and GE Aisys 
(GE Healthcare) anesthesia machines, delivers set agent 
concentrations accurately with low FGFs and possesses 
enhanced safety features. Vaporization systems such as those 
employed by Maquet and DIVA™ present a capability to rapidly 
achieve the predetermined end-tidal agent concentration, 
ensuring minimal wastage and theater pollution. AnaConDa™ 
represents an integration of a vaporizer with a humidity and 
moisture exchange filter designed for incorporation into the 
ventilatory circuit. This system facilitates the administration 
of a safe sedative dose, either isoflurane or sevoflurane, to 
patients using existing critical care ventilators. This approach 
not only reduces the overall quantity of anesthetic required 
but also safeguards the care environment and healthcare 
workers from undue exposure to these substances.
These contemporary vaporization technologies offer efficient 
and cost-effective means for delivering anesthetic gases, 
concurrently minimizing waste within the operating room. In 
the evolving landscape of healthcare data analytics, several 
companies are now offer advanced software solutions for 
perioperative care and anesthesia data analytics on a breath-
by-breath basis, storing it in the Cloud, and analyzing it using 
advanced algorithms for customer access through a web-
based dashboard. This innovative approach aligns with the 
broader trend of leveraging data analytics to enhance patient 
care, streamline operations, and drive better outcomes in 
healthcare settings. 
Closed-loop anesthesia delivery systems
This represents an innovative strategy for optimizing 
gas administration. The approach encompasses the 
measurement of diverse physiological parameters, including 
the electrocardiogram waveform, pulse rate, blood pressure, 
and body temperature, through various sensors placed on 
the patient’s body. These measured parameters play a pivotal 
role in governing the administration of anesthesia during 
major surgical procedures, guaranteeing the maintenance of 
the desired output level.56 In essence, these advancements 
in anesthesia delivery systems, coupled with waste gas 
treatment devices, collectively contribute to waste reduction 
and enhanced cost savings within the confines of the 
operating room.
Comprehensive training and education
It is imperative to educate and offer guidance to healthcare 
practitioners on the critical significance of limiting exposure to 
and managing anesthetic gases. Their education and training 
can be effectively conducted by imparting knowledge on 
waste segregation, providing customized propofol preparation 
charts, and administering human factors training sessions. 
Waste segregation education for anesthesia staff has been 
shown to improve waste segregation compliance in the 
operating room, increase waste management knowledge, 
improve sharps waste bin compliance, and produce cost 
savings.57 Customized propofol preparation charts can aid 
anesthesia professionals in determining the approximate 
requirement for the duration of a procedure, leading to waste 
reduction and cost savings for healthcare organizations.58 
Human factors training in the operative environment can 
teach skills such as behaviors and attitudes, teamwork, 
communication, situation awareness, and leadership, which 
can help to improve patient safety in the operating room.59
Routine maintenance and calibration
It includes implementing scavenging systems and 
administrative controls to minimize exposure to waste 
anesthetic gases.60 Proper maintenance plans for heating, 
ventilating, and air-conditioning systems also play a significant 
role in creating favorable indoor environmental conditions 
and controlling nosocomial infections.61 By applying condition-
based maintenance techniques, hospitals can improve the 
working practices of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning 
maintenance departments, optimize maintenance plans based 
on equipment’s remaining useful life and associated costs, and 
make informed decisions regarding equipment investment.62 
Implementing these maintenance practices and controls 
can help ensure the safe and efficient use of anesthesia 
equipment, protecting the health and well-being of healthcare 
personnel in the operating room.

Review
the ability to detect deviations from safe exposure limits. 
Monitoring helps healthcare facilities promptly identify and 
rectify any issues that may arise, ensuring the safety of both 
patients and medical staff. Monitoring systems, such as 
operating room monitoring systems, can be used to collect 
data from sensor arrays placed around the operating room. 
Analyzed data can help identify protocol violations and trigger 
appropriate responses, such as adjusting heating, ventilating, 
and air-conditioning equipment or providing visual or audible 
alerts. Best practices, administrative controls, and engineering 
controls should be implemented to prevent exposure to waste 
anesthetic gases.63
Institutional environmental responsibility
This involves the implementation of sustainable anesthetic 
strategies, conducting risk assessments, and conducting 
technical controls.64 Sustainable anesthetic strategies 
involve using LFA regimes and more sustainable alternatives 
to halogen gases. Risk assessments help in predicting the 
possible risk to personnel’s health and can guide decision-
making regarding exposure to anesthetic gases. Technical 
controls, such as regular inspection of ventilation systems, the 
use of advanced ventilation systems, and continuous control 
of anesthesia devices, can help minimize exposure to waste 
anesthetic gases. Additionally, implementing the 5 R’s of waste 
minimization (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rethink, and Research) 
in the operating room can reduce the environmental impact 
of anesthesiology practice and decrease costs.65
Research
To lessen the environmental impact of the tools and 
medications we use, research on green anesthesia is currently 
being conducted. This involves evaluating the effectiveness of 
waste segregation education for anesthesia staff in improving 
waste management practices,66 rearranging patient care 
pathways to lessen their carbon footprint,67 investigating the 
use of total intravenous anesthesia and its effects on the 
environment,65 comparing the environmental and financial 
impact of disposable versus reusable medical devices in 
terms of carbon footprint, energy and water consumption, 
and waste generation,39 and so on. An understanding of more 
sustainable anesthetic practices may be gained by initiating 
or participating in these studies.
Conclusion
The strategies to minimize exposure and waste of anesthetic 
gases represent a vital step towards creating a safer, more 
efficient, and environmentally conscious healthcare system. 
By integrating advanced technologies, emphasizing education 
and training, and fostering a culture of responsibility, 
healthcare facilities can achieve significant reductions 
in both exposure risks for healthcare providers and the 
environmental footprint of medical procedures. These 
strategies underscore the potential for positive change within 
the healthcare industry and its commitment to ensuring the 
well-being of patients, medical personnel, and the planet. 
As anesthesiologists, we should play a proactive role both at 
work and outside of it to support environmental sustainability 
and improve the world for the coming generations. The 
review is primarily concerned with the environmental effect of 
anesthesia, specifically the contribution of anesthetic gases to 
greenhouse gas emissions. While this is a significant concern, 
other environmental aspects of anesthesia practice, including 
as waste management, energy consumption, and resource 
exploitation, are still not well addressed in the literature.
